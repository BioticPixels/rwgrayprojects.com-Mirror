# Robert W. Gray's Buckminster Fuller Notes

## Notes to Fuller's World Maps

Because of the amount of information I have accumulated on Fuller's world maps, particularly the icosahedron based map, I have divide the information into many different parts.  But first, here is an example of Fuller's Icosahedron based world map (sometime refereed to as the Dymaxion<sup>TM</sup> map.)

I have published 2 papers on Fuller's maps. The references are:

1. Gray, Robert W., Fuller's Dymaxion<sup>TM</sup> Map, *Cartography and Geographic Information Systems*, 21(4): 243-246, 1994.
