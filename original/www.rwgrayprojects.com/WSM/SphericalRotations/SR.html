<p>
A big part of Wolff's Wave Structure of Matter model depends on 
the "spherical rotation" of the vacuum medium. (See Milo Wolff's book 
"Schrodinger's Universe".)  Spherical rotation is a way for a continuous
medium to stretch/twist and rotate/spin such that after 720&deg; rotation the medium 
is back to its initial configuration.  
</p>

<p>
The basic reference I've used to start understanding this motion is 
E. P. Battey-Pratt and T. J. Racey, "Geometric Model for Fundamental Particles", 
International Journal of Theoretical Physics, Vol. 19, No. 6, pp. 437-475, 1980.
</p>

<p>
Figure 1 from that paper shows a simple model that can be built to show that the center 
sphere, attached by string or rubber bands to a fixed frame, requires a rotation of 720&deg; to return 
to its original configuration.

<p>
Figure 3 from the paper shows several snap shots of the motion as the center sphere 
rotates through 720&deg;.

<p>
I've struggled with trying to understand this motion.  I think I understand it now
and I hope to provide enough pictures and animations
so that it becomes "simple" for you to understand.  I'll show you a somewhat complicated 
way of looking at it (as pictured in the paper) and then a (I think) simpler way to 
picture the motion.
</p>

<P>
Start with the ball hanging in space with 6 stings attached.  These 6 strings are along the
x-, y-, z- axes.  Think of these as 6 strings attached to 
the inside surface of a fixed spherical shell and at the other end, attached to 
the ball at the center which is to rotate.  All the strings are straight.
</p>

<p>


<p>
Note that this is <b><i>not</i></b> the "initial" state.  This is not the configuration
we mean when writing that "after 720&deg; rotation of the center ball the system is
back to its initial configuration."  Because of this, these "spherical rotations" never
returns to the "all strings straight" configuration.
</p>

<p>
Well then, how do we get the "intial configuration"?
</p> 

<P>
We have assigned coordinate axes in the above figure.
</p>

<p>
Take the x-axis and rotate the center sphere by 180&deg;.  <b><i>This</i></b> is 
the initial configuration.

<p>
Now, rotate the center sphere about the z-axis.  This generates all the 
snap shot images in Fig. 3 of the Batty-Pratt paper (see above).

(Sorry for the low resolution.  One of my graphics programs is fighting me 
and I lost this round.  Hope to have better quality animation late, but also don't want
to spend all my time on computer programming issues.  Let's move on to the physics of 
it all!)
</p>

<p>
The motion looks complicated!  It gave me quite a headache to figure out how to program it.
But don't worry, I've found a relatively simple way to understand and to visualize (and
program) the motion.
</p>

<p>
Consider the initial rotation about the x-axis which results in the initial 
configuration.  This stretches all the rubber bands (which I'll now 
call "stream-lines") in the yz-plane to become a plane of spiral steam-lines.
</p>

<p align="center">
 <img src="exp01.jpg"> <img src="exp01b.jpg">
<br>
Figure 7 &amp; 8
</p>

<p>
(Yup, yet another graphics program....)
</p>

<p>
The outer sliver color ring is to represent the fixed spherical shell.  In "reality"
there is no fixed spherical shell, only vacuum medium.  But using a spherical shell
helps visualize the problem.  Just remember it really isn't there.
</p>



<p>
The question to think about is: "What happens to all the other stream-lines from
the outer shell to the rotating center sphere that are not in the yz-plane?"
</p>

<p>
Well, they also need to be rotated.  All the stream-lines in the yz-plane are rotated
by 180&deg; as you follow them from the outer, fixed spherical shell
in to the rotating center sphere.  
And the two stream-lines exactly on the x-axis (two because one
is on the +x-axis and the other is on the -x-axis) also need to be twisted by 180&deg;.
It is then reasonable to assume that all the other stream-lines between the yz-plane
and the x-axis also need to be rotated by 180&deg;.   
</p>


<p>
From the circular symmetry of the problem, rotation about the x-axis, we can say 
that all the stream-lines that define a <b>cone</b> about the x-axis will get
rotated in exactly the same way.  So, we can think of the problem as layers of cones,
centered (apex) at the coordinate center, with symmetry axis being the x-axis.

This is the <b><i>initial configuration</b></i>.  
This is what I now call the "Spherical Rotation structure", "SRot strucutre" or just "SRS".
</p>

<p>
The dynamics comes in "simply" by letting this <b><i>strucutral pattern</b></i>
 rotate about the z-axis.

Figure 14
</p>



<p>
It is a little tricky to understand this rotating strucutral pattern.  The pictures are 
a little missleading until you understand them.
It is <b><i>NOT</b></i>
the <b><i>structure</b></i> that is rotated. This is why I left the x- and y-axes stationary. 
It is the <b><i>pattern</b></i> that gets rotated in the medium that
the pattern is passing through.  It is <b><i>not the space</b></i> that is 
rotating but the vortex pattern in the space that is rotated.
</p>

<p>
Consider these still pictures.
</p>

<p align="center">
 <img src="still02.jpg"> <img src="still03.jpg">
<br>
Fiugre 15 &amp; 16
</p>

<p>
There is a small white square at the end of one of the stream-lines in the first still.
There is another white square in the second still.  Although it <b>looks like</b> 
we simply rotated the 
stream-line to the new position, this is <b><i>NOT</i></b> what happend.  
The stream-lines indicated by the white squares are actually
<b>two different stream-lines</b>.  The <b><i>pattern</i></b> has shifted 
from still #1 to still #2, <b>not</b> 
the stream-lines.  Remember that the stream-lines are <b>fixed</b> to the 
outer shell which 
doesn't rotate.  But the <b>pattern</b> does rotate to be realized by 
<b>different</b> stream-lines.
In order to accomplish this, the stream-lines need to move in the way shown in the
very first (gray scale) animation on this web page.  <b>That's the movement of 
the stream-lines.</b>
</p>

<p>
I know it is a little tricky to see, but once you get it, it is much easier to 
visualize what is going on.
</p>

<p>
Some things I'd like to point out....
</p>

<p>
There are 2 stream-lines that hold their shape up to a little twisting.  These are the
two strem lines coming in along the z-axis.  They beome spirals shapes in a plane 
and they hold that planar shape as the spherical rotation structure goes 
through its motion.  These two stream-lines are shown in green in the next figure.
</p>

<p align="center">
 <img src="sl01.jpg">
<br>
Figure 17
</p>

<p>
There are two lines/axes that are "special" to the spherical rotation <b>structure</b>.
They are: 
<br>
1) The z-axis that the center sphere rotates about.  (You can say that the 
center sphere rotation defines a direction we label "z-axis".)
<br>
2) The vortex's symmetry axis which is 90&deg; from the z-axis.  
This vortex axis travels around the z-axis in what we can label as the "xy-plane".
</p>

<p>
If we consider a line from infinity to the spherical rotation <b>structure</b>
(to the fixed shell, but the shell isn't really there)
we see that depending on where the line is coming from with respect to the 
spherical rotaion (SRot) structure's orientation, the path traveled through the
SRot is different from other lines coming in from a different direction.  Simply
stated, the SRot structure is not spherically symmetric.  This means that we need
to worry about the spherically symmetric in-waves of the WSM model as the 
in-waves pass through the 
SRot strucutre.  Different parts of the in-wave might get "distorded" in different 
ways, thus producing a non-spherically symmetric out-way.
For example, a line dircetly along the z-axis will travel differently through the 
SRot strucutre than a line traveling, say, in along the x-axis. We wont know until the
detials are worked out.
</p>
