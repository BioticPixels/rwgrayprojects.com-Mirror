<P>

</p>

<p>
While studying the Wave Structure of Matter (WSM) I have found a few problems that
need to be resolved.  I do not consider these problems unresolvable, but
I don't have the answers at the moment.  The problems are:
<p>

<ol>
<li>
(06-14-2008) I now think I was wrong about the parity being a problem, so I have removed 
it from the list.  

<br><br>
</li>

<li>
The in-wave passing through or near the Sun is said to slow down (or speed up).  
Doesn't that mean that it is possible for the in-wave to be slowed down to the point that it
is 180&deg; out of phase with the other portion of the particle's in-wave?  Is that a problem? 

<br><br>
</li>

<li>
No part of the "out-wave" of any particle can be the (or part of the) "in-wave" of another
particle.  That is, each particle must stand alone, being both a transmiter and a receiver 
of <u><b>its own</b></u> waves.  This means that the "Huygens Principle" 
(see 
<a href="http://www.spaceandmotion.com/science-physics-wsm-wave-diagrams.htm">
http://www.spaceandmotion.com/science-physics-wsm-wave-diagrams.htm
</a>)
can not be used to explain a particle's in-wave.
<br><br>
The reason for this is that if (part of) the in-wave is (part of) the out-wave from another
particle, along the line between the 2 particles, then there is nothing to add to get a resulting 
wave amplitude in the space between the 2 particles.  
<br><br>
There is nothing in the wave equation
for substituting (part of) one particle's wave for (part of) another particle's wave.    
<br><br>
You can, of course, add the two particle's distinct waves together to get a net wave in the space between
the two praticles, but that requires each particle having <b><u>its own</u></b> (in-, out-) waves.

<br><br>
<hr width="50%">
(06-14-2008) I think I can explain the Huygens "problem" symbolically.
<br><br>
Consider particles A and B. We write
<br>
A = SW-A which is the standing wave for particle A
<br>
B = SW-B which is the standing wave for particle B
<br><br>
(NOTE: I am only talking about that portion of the waves along the
line connecting A and B in all that follows.)
<br><br>
Now,
<br><br>
A = SW-A = IN-W-A + OUT-W-A (in- and out- waves)
<br>
B = SW-B = IN-W-B + OUT-W-B (in- and out- waves)
<br><br>
I can add the waves to get the net effect in the medium
<br><br>
A+B = (IN-W-A + OUT-W-A) + (IN-W-B + OUT-W-B)
<br><br>
No problem. And you need to do this in order to work with the MAP:
Sum the waves when B is in position #1, move B a little closer to A
(position #2) and sum the waves again. Whichever position produces
the minimum overall amplitude in the medium is the prefered position
and gives a definition/direction of the Electric Force.
<br><br>
Anyway, now do this using the Huygens Principle.
<br><br>
We have the in-wave of B being the out-wave of A and the in-wave of A
being the out-wave of B.
<br><br>
IN-W-B defined to be OUT-W-A
<br>
IN-W-A defined to be OUT-W-B
<br><br>
Then A+B becomes
<br><br>
A+B = (OUT-W-B + OUT-W-A) + (OUT-W-A + OUT-W-B)
<br><br>
But let us not *double count* the *same* wave! So then we have
<br><br>
A+B = OUT-W-A + OUT-W-B
<br><br>
But isn't the out-wave of B just the in-wave of A?
So then
<br><br>
A+B = OUT-W-A + IN-W-A = A
<br><br>
So A+B = A.
<br><br>
There seems to be a problem here.
<br><br>
There is no problem, as I mentioned above, if all waves in our
accounting are distinct from one another. In- and out- waves of one
particle has nothing to do with the in- and out- waves of another
particle *except* that they contribute to change the medium between
the two particles and thus slowing or speeding up the wave
propagation.
<br><br>
The only problem then is one of "Where do the in-waves come from?"
But, hey, if you think about such things, then where do the out-waves
come from? From the dynamics of the electron? But then where do the
dynamics of the electron come from? And so on..... I think the best
we'll be able to do is to simply state or postulate that there *are*
in-waves and out-waves and go from there. Not satisfying, but where
else can you start from?

<br><br>

<p>
If you have answers to (or suggestions for resolving) these problems of the WSM, please let me know.
</p>

<p>
<b><u><i>Of course</i></u></b> I may simply missunderstand the WSM model.  
I'd want to know that as well.  Hopefully with details so I can correct my missunderstanding(s).
