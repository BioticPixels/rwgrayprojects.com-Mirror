I am not satisfied with the "spherical rotation" models, animations, descriptions, etc.
that I have seen.  
(See my <a href="../WSM.html">WSM web pages on spherical rotation</a>.)  
</p>

<p>
Basically, they involve a rotating sphere at the center.  Some people
suggest shrinking the center sphere to a point at the center.
</p>

<p>
What I don't like about all this is that these models are
 missing half the motion or half of the pattern in the medium.
</p>

<p>
For example, consider the sine wave shown below.
</p>

</p>

<p>
The 1/4 wavelength has a minimum and a maximum "displacement" points.  I map thsi to the 
spherical rotation model as follows.
</p>

Figure 2
</p>

<p>
This puts a "maximum displacement" point on the center rotating sphere.
</p>


<p>
I think the center should be a minimum displacement point.  
So to complete the 1/2-wave segment, add another complimentary sphere as follows.
</p>

<p>
Now we have a wave node at the fixed outer shell and at the inner-most fixed sphere, with 
a rotating mid-sphere.  The mid-sphere is such that it rotates twice about the z-axis
for the entire space patern to return to its original configuration.
</p>   

<p>
Here is an animation. (Unfortunately the stream lines show sharp kinks.  This would not 
actually be the case, but it is the easiest to program at the moment.)

<p>
Note that this now allows for higher resonances.  Since the center sphere is now fixed 
it can become the new fixed outer shell inside of which is another spherical resonance.

<p>
Seems my "extensions" to the Spherical Rotation such that a center sphere can 
remain stationary is well known.

After doing this work, someone sent to me the following link to a short piece on
the Dirac String Trick.   Very nice animations.
