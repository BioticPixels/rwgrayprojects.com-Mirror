<H1>Welcome to<BR> P.D. Structures</H1>
</DIV>
<HR>
<P>
This company was started in order to continue the development work
on Jay Baldwin's "Pillow Dome" concept as well as other structural
systems.  I am currently providing <I>components</I> for building
"pillow" domes.
</P>
<P>
Pillow domes, invented by
<A HREF="http://www.wnet.org/archive/bucky/buckyworks.html">
Jay Baldwin</A>,
are tube framed domes covered by clear "air" pillows.  Because
the material used does not yellow or otherwise turn cloudy in prolonged
direct sunlight, it will stay clear for many (over 10) years.  And
since the material does not "out gas", there is no ugly chemical
smell (unlike some vinyl material.)  What you have is a clear enclosure
which allows you to enjoy the view of the environment all around you.
</P>

<P>
Pillow domes would be ideal for covers to

if the investment for sustainable dome prototyping and
development could be raised.  
</P>
<P>
Once sufficiently developed, Pillow domes may also be used for retreats, observation posts,
enclosed gazebos, green houses, pool enclosures, and other protective cover
applications.
