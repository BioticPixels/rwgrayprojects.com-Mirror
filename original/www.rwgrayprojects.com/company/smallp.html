<P>
I want to make <I>sure</I> you understand
the following points about the pillow domes I am producing:
<UL>
<LI>These products should be considered "experimental."
I do not have enough experience/information to know exactly how
these pillow domes will perform in all situations.  If you build
a pillow dome, please keep me informed as to its performance and
problems so that I may pass your experience on to other people.
<BR><BR>
<LI>These products are still <I>very</I> much
a "do-it-yourself" project.  I am trying to provide you
with the needed <I>parts.</I>  And I will do my best to
ensure that all the parts fit together correctly.  But you
will have to assemble the dome in its final location.  (Or
you can hire my team to travel to your location and assemble it for you.
"I'm not cheap but I can be had.")
<BR><BR>
<LI>I am neither an architect nor a structural engineer.
Therefore I can not <I>certify</I> the final product.
<BR><BR>
<LI>The foundation to which the dome is attached is a <I>very</I>
important component to the dome.  I do not provide any material
nor blueprints for foundations.  I will provide you with all the
mathematical detail on the <I>shape</I> of your dome so that a foundation
can be properly designed.
Be warned; even in "light" wind
domes can develop a tremendous <B><BIG>lift</BIG></B>.  Foundations
for domes must be designed to prevent the dome from literally
flying away.  Adding <I>weight</I> to the dome's tube frame by suspending
floors, walls or other items in an attempt to prevent the dome from
lifting is <I>not</I> a good idea.  (See next item.)
<BR><BR>
<LI>Although single layer tube frame domes of the kind I am producing
can withstand snow loads, they are not designed to have additional floors
suspended from the frame.  I do not recommend
and, in fact, I discourage you from hanging <I>anything</I>
from the dome frame.  The <I>only</I> attachment to the dome frame
should be the foundation.
<BR><BR>
<LI>I <I><BIG>do not</BIG></I> recommend these domes as living spaces
or for homes/houses.  If <I>you</I> choose to use them as a home or
as a temparary residence or even as a storage facility, be advised that,
depending on climate, they can develope dew on the <I>inside</I> of the
dome.  And depending on the ventalation design (or lack thereof)
they can become very hot inside.  All these "problems" <I>have</I>
solutions.  Some solutions are better than others.  It is up to you
to be aware of these "problems" and to provide your own solutions.  I can
give you <I>suggestions</I> to <I>try,</I>  but I make no promises
nor offer any guarentee of the dome's performance in your climate and
specific situation.  This is, in part, why they are still "experimental."
<BR><BR>
<LI>If you use air to inflat the dome's pilows then water droplets will
probably
develop between the pillows' layers.  These are <I>very</I> hard to eliminate
once they have developed.  So, I recommend that argon (or nitrogen) gas
be used instead of air.  However, even using argon may not eliminate
water dropletts from forming over the years.  This is because the material
used to make the pillows <I>does</I> allow a little moisture to
penetrate into the pillows.  Over the years, enough mositure <I>may</I>
accumulate to form water dropletts.
<BR><BR>
<LI>The material I use to make the "air" pillows <I>allows</I> UV sunlight
to pass through it.  Therefore, anything you place inside the pillow dome,
including yourself, will be exposed to normal UV sunlight.  Furnature fabric,
carpets and other colored items placed inside the dome may fade quickly.

<P>
Gee, I hope I haven't scared you away!
</P>

<P>
I simply want to make <I>sure</I> you understand, as best as I can
describe to you, what <I>you</I> need to consider when you <I>begin</I> to
plan your pillow dome project.
