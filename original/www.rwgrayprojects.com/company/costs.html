<P>
The "air" pillows for your tube frame pillow dome may be purchased
separately from the tube frame.
</P>

<P>
There are 2 types of pillows.  This refers to the number and
thickness of the layers of film used to fabricate the pillows.
(I can make other types of pillows if you desire.)

    <TD>Middle Thickness<BR>(mm/inch)</TD>

<P>
The thinner inner layer used in type 2 may be used if you know that
it will not be bumped or poked at by objects or people
inside the dome.

The cost for a 4.5 foot edge pillow of

<TR><TD></TD><TD>type 1 is $90.00 (U.S. dollars)</TD>
<TR><TD></TD><TD>type 2 is $80.00 (U.S. dollars)</TD>
</TABLE>
</DIV>
</P>
<P>
This should give you some idea of the costs for your pillows.  Minor
variations in the edge length of the pillows (+- 1 foot) will only
change the cost of a pillow by <I>approximately</I> +- $10.
</P>

<P>
Because they are currently made to order, by hand, there
is no price variation with the quantity ordered.
</P>

<P>
Don't forget to read the <A HREF="smallp.html"><BIG>small print.</BIG></A>

Click on the "Request Cost Est." button to request a cost
quote for your dome.
