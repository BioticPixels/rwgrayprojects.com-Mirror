Introduction
</h1>

<p align="justify">
A Transmission Electron Microscope (TEM) was used to image
multiwall carbon nanotubes on a porous polysilicon substrate.
</p>


<p align="justify">
The size (area) of the pores and the outer diameter of the nanotubes 
were determined using the image analysis tools in ImageJ.
</p>

<p align="justify">
Image pairs were collected and used to create anaglyphs
and stereo images which, when viewed with special glasses, 
produce 3D images.  Such 3D images can provide 
important information about 
a sample which a flat 2D image can not provide.
</p>

<p align="justify">
Colorization of the images, including the stereo image pairs,
was performed in an attempt to enhance viewing the images.

<p align="justify">
A Tecnai G<sup>2</sup> TEM with STEM ability
 was used for the imaging 
of the multiwall carbon nanotubes on a porous polysilicon 
substrate.

<p align="justify">
The multiwall carbon nanotubes where obtained from 
Aldrich (677248-5G).  A small portion was mixed in 
isopropanol to dilute the nanotubes.  
</p>

<p align="justify">
The porous polysilicon substrates (approximately 15 nm thick) 
were obtained from SiMPore. (See the website
<a href="http://www.temwindows.com/">http://www.temwindows.com/</a>.)

<br>

<p align="justify">
A pipette was used to place a small drop of the isopropanol
with the nanotubes onto the porous polysilicon substrate.  
A paper towel
was used to wick away the droplet leaving a small residue on
the polysilicon.  The samples where then dried with a 
can of air.

Sample Imaging and Measurements

The TEM was used to produce grey-scale images like 
the one shown in Figure 3.

<p align="justify">
ImageJ, an image processing and analysis program available from  
<a href="http://rsbweb.nih.gov/ij/">http://rsbweb.nih.gov/ij/</a>,
was used to determine the size (area) of the pores and the 
outer diameter of the nanotubes.

The measured pores ranged in size from 95 nm<sup>2</sup>

with an average value of 410 nm<sup>2</sup>.  
(A circle having an area of 410 nm<sup>2</sup> would have
a diameter of about 22.8 nm.)

3D Images
</h1>

<br>

<p align="justify">
By tilting the sample with respect to the imaging 
electron beam direction, pairs of images 
were collected.  These image pairs were then combined to produce
3D images using two different methods: 1) Anaglyphs for red/cyan 
tinted glasses, and 
2) JPS stereo pairs for dual LCD glasses.     
</p>

<p align="justify">
Several tilt angles were attempted 
ranging from 3 degrees to 10 degrees.  No one tilt
angle worked consistently well.  In addition to the 
sample holder drifting after tilting, returning the 
sample holder to its original untilted position did not
produce the same image as the original untilted image.  
This may be due to the nanotubes
moving as a result of interactions with the (charged) imaging beam.   
</p>

<br>

<h1 align="center">
Constructing and Viewing Anaglyphs
</h1>

<br>

<p align="justify">
An anaglyph consists of two overlapping images having 
<i><b>opposite</b> color hues</i>.  One image is taken from a slightly
different point of view with respect to the other. 
(In this case, the sample was tilted with respect to 
the imaging beam.)
</p>

<p align="justify">
The most common colors used are 
red [RGB=(255, 0, 0)] and cyan [RGB=(0,255,255)], although
other colors have been used.

As can be seen when using the tinted glasses, some of the 
nanotubes are standing up off of the substrate.  Such information about the sample
could not have been obtained from a single original TEM image.

Constructing and Viewing JPS Stereo Image Pairs

A jps stereo image pair is a single jpg file containing

The Vuzix<sup><font size="-1">TM</font></sup> 
iWear<sup>&reg;</sup> VR920 
glasses and accompanying software were used for this 
project.  The glasses contain two separate LCD displays. 
The viewing software takes the jps image file and displays the 
left half of the image to the right eye  
while the right half of the image is 
displayed to the left eye.

</p>


<p align="justify">
One advantage that the VR glasses approach has over 
the anaglyph approach is that the VR glasses do not 
depend on the coloring of the image to produce the 3D 
visual effect.  This means that the color aspects 
of the image are much better with 
the VR glasses than with the anaglyph colored lens. 
(Of course, this doesn't help you to <i>color</i> the TEM images!) 
The down side to the VR glasses approach is that the 
image files are twice as big as the anaglyph files.
And if you want to add coloring to
an image, you would have to color two images.

<h1 align="center">
Adding Color to the JPS Image Pairs
</h1>

<br>

<p align="justify">
Some of the TEM images were colored in an attempt to 
enhance the viewing of the 3D images. 
</p>

<p align="justify">
In an attempt to reduce the work required to color 
a jps image pair, only the left half of the image had 
colored (red) nanotubes.
The resulting color of the nanotubes 
when viewed with the VR920 glasses
were appropriately red.  However, this approach
did not work in general for other jps images.  
</p>

<font size="+1">
Figure 16. Coloring nanotubes in left half of a jps image pair.
</font>

</p>

<br>

<p align="justify">
In general, both halves of the jps image had to be 
colored in the same (or similar) way to produce a colored
image when viewed with the VR920 glasses. 
</p>

<br>

<p align="justify">
Unfortunately, the resulting colored images 
did not produce as clear 3D images of the nanotubes 
as the uncolored, grey-scale images.  Perhaps if the 
edges of the nanotubes could be automatically detected
a better result than the freehand approach could be produced.

Concluding Remarks
</h1>

<br>

<p align="justify">
The TEM was used to image porous polysilicon substrates and
multiwall carbon nanotubes. 

</p>

<p align="justify">

The STEM imaging mode 
provided images that were easier to analysis with ImageJ
as this mode produced black colored pores.
It was found that the pores in the 
substrates have an average size (area) of about 400 nm<sup>2</sup>
and have a wide range of sizes (from about 20 nm<sup>2</sup> 
to about 1616 nm<sup>2</sup>).  

</p>

<p align="justify">
The diameters of the carbon nanotubes were measured 
and found to be between about 10 nm and 19 nm.
</p>

<p align="justify">
By collecting image pairs, 3D images 
were formed.  
</p>

<p align="justify">
It was often hard to see 
any 3D effect with the images collected. 
This was due to the nanotubes moving
during adjustments of the sample's angle with respect 
to the incident
electron beam, which frequently made the required
alignment of the images impossible.
</p>

<p align="justify">
The Vuzix VR920 LCD glasses provided 
the best (clearest) viewing of the 3D images, although 
the setup of the software to run the glasses was problematical.
