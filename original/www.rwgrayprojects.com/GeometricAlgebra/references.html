 List of Geometric Algebra References

<li>
 <a href="http://www.phys.uu.nl/~witte/">
  Dr. Frank Witte
 </a>
  has some "Lecture Notes on Classical Physics" and "Lecture Notes in Modern Electrodynamics"
using Geometric Algebra on his web site.
<br><br>
</li>

<li>
 New (2007) book "Geometric Algebra for Computer Science: An Object-Oriented Approach to Geometry"
 by Leo Dorst, Daniel Fontijne, and Stephen Mann. 
<br>
 I've received a copy and I am working through it.
 Fortunately this book <b>does have explicit examples!!</b>    
<br>
The description of the book
includes: "Explains GA as a natural extension of linear algebra and conveys its significance 
for 3D programming of geometry in graphics, vision, and robotics.  Systematically explores the 
concepts and techniques that are key to representing elementary objects and geometric 
operators using GA. Covers in detail the conformal model, a convenient way to 
implement 3D geometry using a 5D representation space. Presents effective approaches to 
making GA an integral part of your programming.  Includes numerous drills and programming 
exercises helpful for both students and practitioners."

  David Hestenes is the main researcher behind the recent development of 
  Geometric Algebra.  See his web site   
   <a href="http://modelingnts.la.asu.edu/">
   Geometric Calculus
   </a>
   which contains lots of papers.
   <br>
   He also has a couple of books including
   <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0792353021/qid=1048025723/sr=2-2/ref=sr_2_2/103-0374802-5635803">
   New Foundations for Classical Mechanics (Fundamental Theories of Physics, V. 99)
   </a>
   and with Garret Sobczyk
   <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/9027716730/qid=1048025723/sr=2-1/ref=sr_2_1/103-0374802-5635803">
    Clifford Algebra to Geometric Calculus: A Unified Language for Mathematics
    and Physics (Fundamental Theories of Physics, Vol 5)
   </a>.  Unfortunately, these books are *very* expensive. 
  
  <br><br>

 <li>
  Pertti Lounesto has a book 
   <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/0521005515/qid=1048025122/sr=1-1/ref=sr_1_1/103-0374802-5635803?v=glance&amp;s=books">
Clifford Algebras and Spinors
   </a>
   which is the best introduction to Clifford Algebras that I have seen. (Unfortunately, 
   he passed away not too long ago.) His web site is at
   <a href="http://www.helsinki.fi/~lounesto/">http://www.helsinki.fi/~lounesto/</a>
   but I don't know for how much longer it will be available.

  William E. Baylis is editor of the book 
   <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/0817638687/qid=1048024730/sr=1-3/ref=sr_1_3/103-0374802-5635803?v=glance&amp;s=books">
Clifford (Geometric) Algebras With Applications to Physics, Mathematics, and Engineering
   </a>
   which I found to be a very useful introduction with applications in physics.
  <br><br>
 </li> 

 
 <li>
  William E. Baylis is also the author of the book 
   <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/0817640258/qid=1048024910/sr=1-1/ref=sr_1_1/103-0374802-5635803?v=glance&amp;s=books">
