<h1 align="center">Geometric Algebra</h1>

<p>
Geometric Algebra (GA) is one of the most exciting developments in Mathematical education 
and Mathematical Physics.  It presents in a unified mathematical language vectors, 
complex numbers, quaternions, spinors, and more.   
</p>

<p>
GA handles rotations easily (because it includes the quaternion algebra) and also provides
a mathematical description for projective geometry.  Because of this, GA is being used
more and more by Computer Science (virtual reality modeling, simulation, computer vision) 
and Robotic Engineers (arm/body movements).
</p>

<p>
Instead of learning just vector analysis in Calculus classes, students will be taught
multivectors in Calculus classes.  Multivectors are the elements of Geometric Algebra.
This combination is known as Geometric Calculus. (See Hestenes reference below.)
</p>

<p>
Geometric Algebra is also called Clifford Algebra.
