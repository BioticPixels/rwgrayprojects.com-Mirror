<I>CAPTION to Fig. 32</I>: This four-sided Tensegrity mast, one of the
family of masts which has grown out of Fuller's
discoveries, consists of discontinuous compression islands--each
composed of tetrahedronal strut groups which are
mounted, exclusively in tension, one above the other.  It was constructed
under Fuller's direction by his students at the University
of North Carolina ca. 1950, and is about 20 ft. tall.
