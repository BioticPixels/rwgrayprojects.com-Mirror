<P>
<I>CAPTION to the sequence of Figs. 25 thru 31</I>:
A Progression in Tensegrity structures from simple to highly
complex is seen on these two pages, culminating in the sphere
(<I>Fig. 31</I>), model for a forty-foot, 270-strut
sphere which was built at the University of Minnesota
in 1953-54.  Note that compression members do not touch
(they are not continuous), but the only continuous,
cohering force is tension.
