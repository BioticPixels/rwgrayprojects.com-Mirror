<P>
It is commonly overlooked that the patrons of architects,
engineers and professional craftsmen are inherently the
prime designers of their projects. Theirs is the conceptioning,
the will to do, the initiative and the statement of limits.
Conceivers of great industries and their trans-national patterning
have been the large pattern-designers of the last world century.
Those who have been successful world-industry designers have also
been powerful anarchistic authorities.
</P>
<P>
In this last century
many conceivers and concept-explorers have been unwilling to submit
to patronage lest the patron compromise the potentials of their
conceiving. Under the powerful economic network woven by the major
industrial conceivers, economic survival was difficult for the
untamed artists--for this they were.
</P>
<P>
In the long evolution of
fundamental rights of men and the slow inhibition of these rights
into the securing codes of society, the letters patent issuable
to individuals who, on their own initiative, succeed in
augmentation of the commonwealth have been common to all manner of
governments. Absolute monarchs and republics have alike honored
their individuals with temporary monopolies to replenish and
regenerate their creative resources. Patents are operative in
Russia and behind the Iron and Bamboo Curtains; patents are operative
in the Western world. Patents are not operative, however, between
these two world domains.
</P>
<P>
Amongst other fundamental experiments
which I have been conducting over the last forty years has
been the testing of whether the individual may achieve original
formulations and initiate their realization in world economic
patterning without either the compromising direct patronage or
politically-seized dictatorial power. It seemed that the only
possibility of so doing lay in the direction of patents secured
entirely through the inventor's own economic means. Because I
have been fortunate enough to have been befriended by many artists
of extraordinary individual and original conceptual initiative,
and because I have had the further good fortune to have gained
long-time experience, not only in patent-law, but in patent-securing,
-maintenance, and the broad economic ramifications of patent-holding
in the most recent era of massive government and
massive corporation (made more difficult by the shroud of official
secrecy embracing the unprecedented technical acceleration of our
era), I am eager to discuss the economic security of the artists
and their potential joining of forces, as did the medical
profession long ago, in the advantageous realizations for world
democracy inherent in the artist-joined anticipatory competence.
</P>
<P>
It is a sad fact that the world of patronized design is the last
area of commonly accepted social behavior where piracy is
considered ethical. Patrons hire designers to steal their competitors'
work. Patrons hire designers to steal other non-professional
designers' fresh-new crops of potential economic growth. Only
by joining forces will the architect-, scientist-,
engineer-artists be able to eliminate this intellectual
cancer of the regenerative
processes.
</P>
<P>
I am going to discuss a special case of structural
exploration and invention. This published discussion constitutes
what is legally called "public disclosure" of an invention
which I have "reduced to practice," which latter reduction puts
me by common law in the powerful position of holding momentary
monopoly of the economic employment thereof. I have fortified
this common-law position with patents already obtained, as well as
patent applications in process. I fortunately hold several
patents covering geodesic structures in America and in almost
every other country in the world which subscribes to the Berne
(Switzerland) patent convention. If I did not have this patent
protection, I am confident that neither the government nor any of the
great industrial corporations would in any way have recognized
my invention of these structures. Though big government has
spent billions in noneffective structural research, I frequently
encounter the statement by government and corporation bureaucrats
that they consider it their duty to the taxpayer to use their
enormous powers of specification and purchase to circumvent my
patents covering structures which I had anticipatorily invented
at my own expense and developed to satisfy society's needs under just
such emergent necessities as those confronting the bureaucrats.
The basis of their contention is that the few thousands of
regenerative dollars that may be returned to me represent an
immoral exploitation by the individual of democracy's emergency needs.
They completely overlook the billions of taxpayers' dollars they
have already fruitlessly spent in their intra-mural budgetary
politics, attempted under the supposition that they will be
rewarded by their incumbent masters if they can stretch
yesterday's investments to cover tomorrow's evolutionary
transformations. How can they justify large research and
development budgets for next year if it were visible that
the original technical gains
were accruing exclusively to society from the individual
preoccupations
and initiatives existing entirely outside of massive
government and massive corporate manufacture and distribution?
The self-deceit of democracy at this moment in history by its
professionally advertised aggrandisement of the "corporate image"
with reputed impeccability of super-inventiveness may be the undoing
of democracy's case until another century has washed away this
miasmic fallacy. Not only have these professional word- and
picture-factories manufactured the greatest and most persuasively
erroneous myths, but they also have robbed our heritage of
word- and picture-language of its incisively exquisite
effectiveness. The primary tools of men have been blunted
and misappropriated. Bereft of the age-long developed tools,
artists of our day
have sought for new and vital means of communication. The beatnik
is the anti-body of Madison Avenue. The true artists seek escape
from the stale-mated vacuum of the two. History tells us that
they will probably be successful. The probability is that the
artists will win enjoyment of our whole earth by all the world's
people--with the complete emancipation of man's innate freshness
and regenerative conceptioning.

<H3>
PATENTS AND NATURAL PRINCIPLES
</H3>
<P>
One
cannot patent geometry per se nor any separate
differentiated-out, pure principle of nature's
operative processes. One can
patent, however, the surprise complex behaviors of associated
principles, where the behavior of the whole is unpredicted by
the behavior of the parts, i.e. synergetic phenomena. The latter
is what
is known as an invention, a complex arrangement, not found in
nature, though sometimes superficially similar to nature. Though
superficially similar in patternings to Radiolaria and Flies'
Eyes, geodesic structuring is true invention. The Radiolaria
collapse when taken out of water. Flies' Eyes will not provide
structural precedent or man-occupiable structures.
</P>
<P>
The processes
of engineering, up to the moment of introduction of my invention of
Geodesic structures, are predicated upon the stress analysis
of individual beam and column behaviors, as separate components and
thereafter upon comprehensively organized beams, columns and
cantilevers as a solid compressional over-all integrity of
cohesion, aided here and there by tensionally exaggerated
sinews--tension being subordinate and local. Therefore, engineering
as academically constituted in 1951 could in no way predict
the associated behaviors of Geodesics, in which
<I>any</I> one, several
or many of the components could be removed without, in any way,
jeopardizing the structural integrity cohesion of the remaining primary
structure.
</P>
<P>
I have visited approximately all the leading
universities and engineering schools in the U.S.A. (only as
their spontaneously invited guest, as I allow no promotion or agentry
solicitation of engagements ), and I have been a guest of major
architectural and engineering societies around the world. I am
able to state from the direct testimony of its leaders, that
world engineering not only was surprised by the Geodesic behavior
but clearly stated that it was unable to explain or predict
the unprecedented performance per pound efficacy of the geodesic
structures by any of the academically known mathematical principles
of analysis. In lieu of an extant and proven theory of Geodesics
and their stress analysis strategies, engineers professionally
charged with the responsibility of validating my (or my companies')
Geodesic dome undertakings have only one recourse, and that is to
direct static load testing accompanied by progressive
electric strain gauge readings with loading carried through to
"failure." Thereafter, formulas are derived, which do not provide
any general theory but only special knowledge concerning this
particular case. However, I do enjoy a lucid theory of geodesic
structuring which I have frequently reduced to successful practice
in technical, economic and industrial ways.
</P>
<P>
For these reasons I
have had to develop a completely new strategy of educational
exposition of synergetic behaviors.It is because I have
developed the Geodesic theory and not only the invention but this
effective strategy of exposition, that I am, and have been,
invited to conduct original seminars in the primary educational
institutions around the world, as well as before the important
annual
professional conventions of primary engineering-architectural
bodies of these countries.
</P>
<P>
Whereas, engineers told me, before
my full-scale demonstrations of Geodesic structures, that Geodesics
would not work; now, after one-third of a century of expositional
engagements and discourse, there has been produced altogether
such an effect upon the general climate of technology that
Geodesic componentation is frequently employed by others with
satisfactory structural results, though the individuals do not
know why.
This occurs because of a subconsciously-marshaled approach of
the design factors generated
by hundreds of news photographs of successfully
standing structures, ranging from desk models
<A HREF="f01.html">[Figs. 1 and 2]</A>
to the largest clear-span enclosures
of all history. Many of these are shown being flown to
installation sites, some of which are at the world's
formidable polar,mountain and desert regions.
</P>
<P>
All these Geodesic events were news items simply because
they were synergetic surprises, ergo contrary to the
obvious. Copied geodesic ventures in higher modular
frequency of triangular Geodesic subdivisioning,
or other less symmetrical employments of the
Geodesic
structural integrity than I have as yet undertaken, do
not constitute invention.Nor does the variation warrant
exemption from the temporary economic authority granted
to me as a patent.
</P>
<P>
There have been recent news references to structures which I
have designed for firing to the Moon. Six hundred pounds
is the approximate weight of my thirty-six foot diameter
sphere self-openable from a thirty-six inch diameter ball.
There can, and probably will,
be much larger units, which I will discuss later in this
disclosure. Of first interest to engineers and artist-conceivers
is the fact that my potential prototypes of
satellite- and moon-structures are tensional integrity,
omni-triangulated, high-tensile-cabled,
spherical nets in which local islands of compression
act only as local sprit-stiffeners. The local stiffeners are
so oriented that they angle inwardly and outwardly between
comprehensively finite, exterior and interior, tensional,
spherical nets, thus
producing positive and negative waves of action and reaction
in inter-stabilized dynamic equilibrium.
</P>
<P>
Recourse to this
discontinuous-compression, continuous-tensioning structure
was not obvious to man, therefore the following needs to be
observed.
</P>
<P>
Whereas compression members have an inherent limit ratio of
section diameter to length
<A HREF="f10.html">[Fig. 10]</A>,
tension members have no
inherent ratio of section diameter to length. The Greeks, who
built entirely in compression, discovered that a stone
column's slenderness
ratio was approximately 18 to 1 of length to diameter.
Modern structural steel columns with an integral tensional
fibering unpossessed by these stone columns have a
limit slenderness ratio of approximately 33 to 1.
</P>
<P>
If we have better metallurgical alloys,
we can make longer and longer tension members with
less and less section--apparently ad infinitum, but <I>not</I>
longer compression columns, ad infinitum.
</P>


<H3>GENESIS OF SYNERGETIC GEOMETRY</H3>
<P>
What interested me back in 1927,
regarding the limitless ratios of tensional
slenderness,was whether we were trending toward bridges
which had infinite length and no section dimension at all,
or whether this was a nonsensical question. As a sailor I
looked spontaneously into the sky for indicated clues. I
found myself saying, "It
is very interesting to observe that the solar system,
which is the most reliable structure that we know of,
is so constituted that the earth does not roll around on
Mars as would ball bearings <A HREF="f03.html">[Fig.3]</A>,
which is to say that
the compressional components of
celestial structures are astro-islands spatially remote
from one another and they are each shaped in the most
ideal conformation for highest compressional-structure
effectiveness which is the approximately spherical
shape. In the spherical condition any
aspect of a compressional system is its neutral axis,
that is the sphere has an infinity of axes. All other
spheroidal (cigar, turnip, egg, potato or spider)
shapes <A HREF="f04.html">[Fig. 4]</A>
have only one most neutral axis.
This is why spherical ball bearings are the most ideal
compressional system structures of man's devising,
as they continuously shift their loads while distributing
the energetic effects to the most parts in equal, ergo
relatively miniscule shares in the shortest time.
</P>
<P>
I saw
that those astro-islands of
compression of the solar system are continuously controlled in
their progressive repositioning in respect to one another
by comprehensive tension of the system which Newton called
"gravity." This effective coherence between island-components
varied in respect to
their relative proximities and masses, in ratio gains and
losses of the second power in respect to the dimensional
distance, as stated in the terms of radius of one of the
component bodies involved.
</P>
<P>
I then switched my observation
from the macrocosmic to
the microcosmic and witnessed that man's probing within the
atom disclosed the same kind of discontinuous-compression,
continuous-tension apparently governing the atom's structure.
That is, the islands of energy concentration of the atom and
its nucleus were
extraordinarily remote from one another in respect to their
measurable local energy concentration diameters,and all were
bound together by a comprehensive but invisible tensional
integrity.
</P>
<P>
As a consequence of these macro-, micro-struoural
reminders, it seemed to me, in 1927, appropriate
to ask also whether man, who obviously tended to
think only of a solid, brick-on-brick, pile-up law
as governing all fundamental forms of structural
modifications, i.e., formal, local alterations of
the "solid" compressional earth's crust, was congenitally
limited to "solid" structural conceptioning, and could
therefore never participate in the far more efficient
structural strategies evidenced in
his (only instrumentally harvested) infra- and ultra-sensorial
data of universal patterning. I also saw that man had long
known of tensional structures, and had experienced and developed
those tensional capabilities but apparently only as a secondary
accessory of primary compressional structuring. For instance, he inserted
a solid mast into a hole in "solid" earth and rammed it in as a
solid continuity of the unitary solid earth
<A HREF="f05.html">[Fig. 5]</A>.
However,
to keep it from blowing over and breaking off when hurricanes
raged, he added a set of tension stays triangulated from the
top of the masthead to the ground, thus taking hold of the
extreme end of the potential mast-lever at the point of
highest advantage against motion. But these tensions were
secondary structuring
actions. So also were they secondary adjuncts in his
solidly built compressional-continuity ships. To man,
building and earth were alike, compressionally continuous.
Compression was that "realistically hard core" that he loves
to refer to, and its hard
reality was universal, ergo comprehensive.
</P>
<P>
It followed
that tension must be secondary, and local, in all his thoughts,
ergo in all his philosophic reasoning. As a consequence, popular
conception of airplane flight was, at first, and for a long time,
erroneously explained as a compressional push-up force operating
under the airplane's wing. It "apparently" progressively compressed
the air below it as a ski compresses the snow into a grooved track
of icy slidability. The scientific fact remains, as
tunnel experiments proved, that 75% of the airplane's weight support
was furnished by the negative lift of the partial vacuum created
atop the air-foil. This is simply because, as Bernoulli showed,
it was a longer way for the air to go around the top of the
foil than under the foil, and so the same amount of air in the
same amount of time had to be stretched thinner, ergo, vacuously
over the top It seemed to me that this stretching thinner, and
its concomitant greater effectiveness of inter-positioning of
bodies (the plane in respect to earth ), was our same friend, the
astro- and nucleic tensional integrity of dynamic interpatterning
causality.
</P>

<H3>THE WIRE WHEEL</H3>
<P>
As I wondered whether it was now
possible for man to inaugurate an era of thinking and conscious
designing in the terms of comprehensive tensions and
discontinuous compressions, I saw that his structural
conceptioning of the wire wheel documented his
intellectual-designing break-through into such thinking and
structuring That is, the compressional
hub of the wire wheel was clearly islanded or isolated, from
the compressional "atoll" comprising the rim of the wheel
<A HREF="f06.html">[Figs. 6 and 7]</A>.
As these compressional islands were only
interpositioned in structural stability by the tensional
spokes, I said that
this was dearly a tensional integrity, where tension was
primary and comprehensive and compression secondary and local.
This reversed the historical structural strategy of man. His
first wire wheel had many and varied numbers of spokes. I probed
mathematically for generalized laws which might govern this tensional
integrity and sought for experimentally proven knowledge governing
the minimum number of spokes necessary to wire wheel stability.
I found that 12 was the minimum number of spokes. Man had used m
ore, in providing a lightweight wheel, as stays for the frequent
support of the resultingly slender rim.
</P>
<P>
Thus I found a
mathematics of natural coordination fundamentally governing the
universally constant and alternate minimum of 12 unique vectors
of freedom, each of equally minimum energy involvement. Out of
the 12 vectors of unique and alternate freedoms of nature's
fundamentally accommodating coordinations, there emerged a
comprehensive hierarchy of entirely rational mathematical
relationships
apparently governing all known fundamental transformation
behaviors of nature. I named this body of mathematical
relationship discovery "Energetic and Synergetic Vectorial
Geometry.-' Out of the comprehensive ramifications of Energetic
and Synergetic
Vectorial Geometry came the eventual, not only to design discontinuous
compression structures, and to comprehend in direct,
consciously-conceived patterning the gamut of orderly
transformal strategies used by nature in her array of
evolutionary designing, which
also proved to be everywhere the most economically
accommodating to the inherently diverse local effects
of the sum total universal coordinations, and respective
progressions, of local energy investments.
</P>

<H3>TENSION vs. COMPRESSION </H3>
<P>
As I considered the 12 unique vectors of freedom constantly
and non-redundantly operative between the two poles of the
wire wheel, its islanded hub and its also islanded equatorial
rim-atoll--in effect a milky-way-like ring of a myriad
of star islands encircling the hub in a plane perpendicular
to the hub axis--I discerned that this most economic arrangement
of forces might also be that minimum possible system of nature
capable of displaying stable constellar compressional
discontinuity and tensional continuity--a one island system of
compression would be an inherently continuous compression
system with tension playing only a redundant and secondary
part. Therefore, a one island system may be considered only
as an optically illusory "unitary" system, for, of course,
at the invisible level of
atomic structuring, the coherence of the myriad atomic
archipelagos of the "single" pebble's compression-island's
mass is, sum totally, and only provided by comprehensively
continuous tension.
</P>
<P>
This fact was invisible to and unthought of by historical
man up to yesterday. Before this mid-twentieth century fact
discovery, there was naught to disturb, challenge or dissolve
his "solid-rock," and other "solid things" thinking.
"Solid thinking" is as
yet comprehensively popular and is even dominant over
the practical considerations of scientists in general
and even over the everyday logic of many otherwise elegantly
self-disciplined nuclear physicists.
</P>
<P>
Tension and compression
are inseparable and coordinate functions of structural
systems, but one may be at
"high tide" aspect, i.e. <I>most</I> prominent phase, white the other
is at "low tide," or <I>least</I> prominent aspect, or phase, e.g., a
visibly tensioned rope is compressively contracted in almost
invisible increment of its girth dimensions, everywhere along its length.
This low-tide aspect of compression occurs in planes perpendicular
to its tensed axis. Columns which ate visibly loaded only, by weights
applied to their respective top ends are easily seen
to have their vertical axis in compression, but <I>invisibly</I> the
horizontal girths of these columns are also in tension, as the
result of a cigar-shaped swelling pattern of forces acting in
the column at right angle to its loaded axis, which tends,
invisibly, to transform toward the shape of a squash or a banana. As
a result of the visible, or high-tide, vertical compressioning
aspect of such axial loading of the column's system, this swelling
force imperceptibly stretches, or tenses, the column's girth as a
low-tide reciprocal function of the overall structural integrity
reciprocity.
</P>
<P>
These vectorial resultants of forces articulated
in planes perpendicular to the axis of the applied force vector,
with concomitant right angle transformation of compression in
to tension and vice-versa, are altogether known as the Poisson
Effect ( as named for their human discoverer and not for a
fish-like behavior). We now know that this imprecisely recognized
reciprocal effect is a precisely operative physical system
phenomenon known as PRECESSION. (See my explanation of precession in
the Sperry Story in <I>Fortune</I>, May 1940.)
</P>
<P>
Precession plays
the major role in my re-statement of the first law of motions,
which says "The entire regenerative hierarchy of major,
intermediate,
and minor constellations of component patterns-within-component-patterns
of universe are continual processes of synchronous, yet independent and
unique, transformative patternings. That is, all components of
universe are in continually accommodative,
associative-disassociative motion reciprocity, and all the moving
components of universe continuously affect all the other moving
components--in varying degrees, ranging between high and low
tide reciprocities of critically intense to critically
negligible. All
of these inter-effects of all the motional components
upon one another are <I>precessional</I>, and precession always
produces transformative resultants in vectorial patterns
which always articulate angular accelerations in directions
other than the 'straight'
lines of directions between the inter-effective components." This
is to say that the effects of all local motion systems in the
universe upon one another are always precessional, and that
none of the resultants of any forces operative between them
are ever
straight line patterns. Individual lines of vectorial
trajectory interactions never go through the same points.
They diverge periodically to innocuity of inter-effectiveness,
or they periodically converge to critical proximities. Their
local interferences,
through critical proximity, produce reflections,
refractions and regenerative-shunting patterns.
</P>

<H3>THE LAW OF SYSTEMS</H3>
<P>
Absolutely straight lines or
an absolutely flat plane would, theoretically, continue
outwardly to infinity. Intellectual comprehension occurs
when patterns of experience return upon themselves in
all directions. The difference between infinity and
finity is governed by the taking of angular sinuses,
like pieces of pie, out of surface areas a
round a point in an absolute plane. This is the way
lamp shades and skirts are made. Joining the sinused
fan-ends together makes a cone; if two cones are made
and their open, ergo infinitely trending, edges are
brought together, a finite system results. It
has two polar points and an equator. These are inherent
and primary characteristics of all finite systems. Man
has employed the convention of subdividing the unity of
encirclement around a point into 360 degrees, formed by
the sum of the radial segmentations
around a point in an absolute plane. If we call 360
degrees "unity," I may state my discovery of the law of
systems as follows: if we subtract the sum of the convergent
angles around all the vertexes of any system from the numbers
of vertexes times
360 degrees, the difference will always be 720 degrees, which is
exactly two times unity; this is to say that the difference
between infinity and finity is always exactly 2. This law
explains many of the previously uncomprehended aspects of
topology <A HREF="f08.html">[Fig. 8]</A>.
Its philosophic implications are startling.
</P>

<P>
The compressively
interprecessional cooperative and accommodative functionings of
<I>all structural systems</I> are locally persistent constellations of
resultant force-vectors, which are always angularly shunted,
and regeneratively re-shunted, inwards of the system's tangential
lines, i.e., at resultant angles less than 180 degrees in respect
to the direction of origin of the generative force. In the high
and low tide cooperative precessional functionings of
tension vs. compression I saw that there are times when each are at
half tide, or equally prominent in their system relationships.
I saw that the exterior of the equatorial compressional island
rim atoll of the wire wheel must be cross-sectionally in tension a
s also must be its hub island's girth. I also saw that all
these tension vs. compression patterning relationships are
completely reversible, and are entirely reversed as when we
considered the compressively spoked "artillery wheel" vs.
"the tensional spoked
wire wheel."
</P>
<P>
I followed through with consideration of
these differentiable, yet complementarily reversible, functions
of structural systems as possibly disclosing the minimum, or
fundamental set of differentiability of non-redundant,
precessionally regenerative structural systems.
</P>
<P>
Employing that concept
as an hypothetical verity or working premise for further
probing, I observed that whereas there existed a limit to
slenderness ratio (as already noted) of a compression
member's girth diameter in respect to its longitudinal
axis length, no such limit
slenderness ratio characterized tensional dominated
structural components. Astronomical magnitudes of
structural system coherence are accomplished by tensionally
dominated structural functions of zero slenderness ratio,
i.e. by gravitational functioning. I also
noted that compressionally dominated structural components
tend toward contour transformation in which the radius of
curvature steadily decreases under axial loading, that is
the cigar shaped column forces tend toward "squash-" or "banana"-like bending
of their contours
<A HREF="f11.html">[Fig. 11]</A>. This tending of compressionally
loaded systems toward arcs of lessening radius was in direct
contrast to the contour transformation trending of
tensionally dominated structural components which always tend toward arcs
of ever increasing radius of axial profile. For instance,
the coil of rope tends toward "straightening out" when
terminally tensed, but never attains absolute straightness
<A HREF="f09.html">[Fig. 9]</A>;
instead, it progresses toward ever-greater
radius of locally-spiralling but
overall-orbital arcing which must eventually cycle
back upon itself
<A HREF="f12.html">[Fig. 12]</A>. Tensionally dominated
patterning is inevitable self-closing, ergo finite.
</P>
<P>
It is seen also that, whereas compressionally
dominated functions of structural systems are inherently
self-diminutive in overall aspect, tensionally dominated
structural functionings are inherently self-enlarging in
overall involvement. Therefore the sum of all the inter-active
force relationship of
universe must continually accelerate their inter-transforming,
in such a manner as to ever result in more remotely and
locally multiplied islanded compressional
functions--comprehensively cohered by ever-enlarging finite
patternings of the tensional functions. <I>The universe
mast be a comprehencively finite integrity</I>,
permitting only a locally-islanded infinitude of
observer-considered-and-regenerated differentiating discovery
<A HREF="f13.html">[Fig. 13]</A>.
This is to say that we have herein discovered a
workable man-awareness of
a complete reversal of presently accepted cosmology and
of general a priori conceptioning regarding the general
patterning scheme of universe which, heretofore, has
always conceived only of <I>locally finite</I> experiences as
omnidirectionally <I>surrounded</I> by seemingly unthinkable
infinity.
</P>
<P>
In the new awareness,
herewith presented, the remote patterning of universe are
inherently finite, and only the local islands
of compression are subdivisible to the degree
of infinity projected by the existence of local
life and its differential dichotomies of progressive
probing. We discover that the more visible, i.e. the
more sensorially tuneable, the structural functions are, then,
the more infinitely subdivisible do their potential
treatments become. The more invisible the structural
functions of the universe, the more comprehensively
and comprehendibly finite they become.
</P>
<P>
While I have been aided by many in the development of
my invented implementations of my discovery of the
comprehensive and coordinating system of nature, an
extraordinary intuitive assist at an important moment
in my exploration of the thus discovered
discontinuous-compression, continuous-tension structures
was given me by a colleague, Kenneth Snelson, and must
be officially mentioned in my formal recital of my
"Tensegrity" discovering thoughts.
</P>

<H3>FOURTH, FIFTH AND SIXTH DIMENSIONS</H3>
<P>
For twenty-one years, before
meeting Kenneth Snelson, I had been ransacking the
Tensegrity concepts. I had used the multiple rimmed,
parallel or concentric wire wheel phases of Tensegrity,
since 1927, in the multi-decked 4D mast structures and
the Dymaxion House. In 1917, ten years
earlier than my first Tensegrity, I had inaugurated and
discovered the vectorial, coordinate, geometrical and
topological system which I named Energetic Synergetic
Geometry. This Energetic-Synergetic Geometry disclosed
fourth, fifth and sixth dimensional symmetry in addition
to the well known two and three dimensional
symmetry. The Tensegrity structure of the Dymaxion House,
despite the fact that I first called it the 4D House--for
fourth dimensionality--was a polarized, i.e. single axis
system of three dimensionality, with equatorial and
latitudinal compressional
atolls, isolated from one another in parallel in the
comprehensive triangulated tensional network. Despite my
discovery, naming and development of both the multi-dimensional
vectorial geometry and the three dimensional Tensegrity,
I had been unable to integrate
them, thus to discover multi-dimensional four, five and six axes
symmetrical Tensegrity. I had realized that the two-axis
universal joint, long known to man and often employed by
mechanics as
a flexible membrane--sandwiched between two diametrically
opposed yoke-ended shafts, with yoke planes symmetrically
oriented at ninety degrees to one another--constitutet an
octahedronal Tensegrity, but its shafted axes tended to
make it appear as a single
axis system similar to my hexagonal wheeled Tensegrity Dymaxion House.
Despite my seeking to discover the connection between Tensegrity and
Energetic Geometry,--and thereby macro-micro universal
structuring in the hierarchy of geometrical transformings of
nature,--and despite my intuitive awareness that I had
glimpsed the existence of the connections, my next score
of years (1927-1947) were preoccupied with the complex
events following my introduction of the Dymaxion House.
This was a prototype solution for
the final application of highest industrial capability
of man toward world encompassing conversion of living
apparatus of men from negative to positive advantage,
and precluded my application of priority thinking to
the marriage of Tensegrity structuring
with Energetic-Synergetic Geometry.
</P>
<P>
In 1947, I gave
a lecture on Energetic-Synergetic Geometry, with an array
of my models, at Black Mountain College. Kenneth Snelson,
an artist, painter student, appeared the next day with
replicas of many of the models
which he had constructed during the night following
my lecture. During the next year, Snelson became one of
my most intimate students. His sensitivity, craftsmanship
and imaginative conceptioning power were extraordinary.
Though I urged him, and though
he tried to undertake a graduate course in nuclear physics,
Snelson found it unbearably unattractive and returned to his
artist's exploration in sculptural constructs and painted
canvas. A year later, in the summer of 1948, Snelson showed
me a sculptural
construct embodying a cantilevered strut of octahedra,
accomplished with Tensegrity applied to the mechanic's
universal joint octahedra, reoriented from their shaft
axes to a parallel plane alignment. Though Snelson thought
of this only as a unique art
form and was apprehensive of my aversion to artistic
exploitation of Energetic Geometry (I have shunned
the daily recurrent opportunities to exploit the
Energetic-Synergetic Geometry either as toys or
objects d'art), he was eager for me to witness his
discovery of a novel and exciting structure. His depolarized
orientation of the Tensegrity-octahedron universal joint
catalyzed my comprehensive integration of the whole
hierarchy of mathematical inter-relationships of my
Tensegrity Structures with my
Energetic-Synergetic Geometry and its multi-dimensional,
multi-axial symmetry.
</P>
<P>
My initial harvest of mathematical
structures produced by this new conceptual tool
was a family of four Tensegrity masts characterized
by vertical side-faces of three, four, five and six
each, respectively. The three and four sided masts
consisted of discontinuous compression islands of
tetrahedronal strut groups mounted only in tension
one above the other, while the five and six sided
masts consisted of local islands of icosahedronal
and octahedronal strut groups mounted vertically
above one another, again only by tensional connectors.
</P>
<P>
It was obvious that each of the seemingly
"solid" compression struts in these island complexes could be
replaced by miniature Tensegrity masts (of any of these
four types) and for the miniature struts in the miniature
Tensegrity masts, sub-miniature Tensegrity masts could
also be substituted <A HREF="f14.html">[Fig. 14]</A>.
By such process of progressive substitutions in
diminishing order of sizes, a final sub-sub-miniature
stage of Tensegrity mast would be substituted for the
last stage of seemingly "solid" struts, i.e., at a size
magnitude of a single atom's structural
diameter. At this stage of local miniaturization, the
inherent discontinuous-compression, tensional integrity
of the non-solid atomic structures themselves would
coincide with the overall structuring principle of
the whole series of masts-within-masts complex.
This eliminates any further requirement of the
now utterly obsolete conception of "solid" anything, as
intervening in the man tuned sensorial ranges between
macro and micro words of ultra and infra sensorial
Tensegrity. My demonstration of the stable
structural supporting capability of such man-witnessable
Tensegrity masts thus eliminated further requirement of
any "solid" conception whatsoever, ergo, rendered obsolete
the illogical engineering theories predicated upon any and
all, "solid" structures.
These were now demonstrable as consisting of both <I>positive</I>
and <I>negative</I> Tensegrities, simultaneously employed
<A HREF="f16.html">[Figs. 16-20]</A>.
Whereas either the <I>positive</I> or the
<I>negative</I> Tensegrity mast would independently provide
the same overall-compressional strut
capability as did the two together, obviously either the
positive or the negative Tensegtity within the "solid"
combination must be doing all the "strut" work at any
one times--the other is entirely superfluous, ergo
redundant. Their alternate capabilities,
being approximately equal, would alternately tend to
exchange the loading task, thus generating an oscillating
interaction of positive vs. negative load transferal which
would expend the energies of their respective structural
integrities, thus tending to
self-interdeterioration (crystallization) of their combined
alternating strut functioning longevity of structural
capability.
<P>
</P>
I also discovered the six-islanded-strut
icosahedron Tensegrity and its all-space filling,
closest-packing capability, thus
providing omni-equi-optimum-economy, Tensegrity universe
structuring. Subsequently, fundamental additions and
fill-ins to this hierarchy of premier Tensegrity structures
were successively accomplished by John Moehlman, Lee Hogden,
Francesco della Sala and
Theodore Pope, working independently of one another, who
demonstrated, respectively, the vector equilibrium,
the thirty-islanded Tensegrity sphere, the six-islanded
Tensegrity tetrahedron and the three-islanded octa-Tensegrity.
The latter in positive and negative
phases is fundamental to all Tensegrity structures. With
the fundamental hierarchy of Tensegrity structures thus
completed, the comprehensive laws of universal tensegrity
structuring emerged. We will present these laws in another
agenda item following
upon our discussion of pertinent discoveries.
</P>

<h3>GEODESIC TENSEGRITIES AS EARTH SATELLITES</H3>
<P>
If we make microscopic inspection of a pneumatic balloon,
we will find that the balloon skin is full of holes
between its molecular chains, with a secondary and
far smaller space continuity of "all holes" or "continuous space"
between the remotely-islanded energetic components of each
molecule's respective atomic nuclear constellations. All
these humanly invisible balloon "holes" are too small for
molecules of gas to escape through. Because the balloons
skin is full of holes, it
is really a subvisible spherical netting, rather than a
"flexibly solid film," within which the gaseous element
molecules are crowded into lesser volume than required
by their respective energetic,
ecological domains, like fish within a seiner's net.
The resultants of forces of all these net-frustrated
molecular actions is angularly outward of the balloon's
geometrical center--each surface molecule of the interior
group of pressured gas has a vectorial action
and reaction pattern identical to a spherical
chord. In such enclosure of pressured gas, random sizes of
molecules, each too large for the spherical molecular
netting's hold impinge randomly upon the interior webbing
of the spherically tensioned
net. There are, therefore, more outwardly pressing
molecules and more inwardly restraining net components
than are necessary to the
structurally resultant balloon pattern integrity.
However, in the geodesic, tensional integrity,
spherical nets the islands of interior compressional
chordal struts impinge in discrete order at the exact
vertexes of the enclosing finite tensional network.
My independent satellite or moon structures are then
the most economical, frequency modulated, dynamic
balances between outward bound resultants of force
and inward bound resultants of force. The exterior
tensional net is a finite system successfully
binding the otherwise randomly entropic infinity of
outbound, self-disassociative forces.
</P>
<P>
As already
noted, a tensionally finite system has no inherent
limit of length to section, i.e. no inherent slenderness
ratio, as do the explicitly limited slenderness
ratios of compression members. We have therefore in the
Geodesic Tensegrity (my name for the discontinuous-compression,
continuous-tension structures) the ability to assemble
unprecedentedly large, clear span structures whose overall
diameter dimensions
are limited only by the relative alloyed coherence of the
associated metallic atoms therein involved, whose
improving coherences are in swiftly multiplying
metallurgical evolution augmentation. We can go,
therefore, into the same magnitudes of clear-spanning
dimensions as our largest suspension bridges.
As these bridges demonstrate the continually improving
tensile capabilities of constantly improving alloys,
one could now be made twice the size of the Golden Gate Bridge.
We may, therefore, consider clear-
span, Geodesic Tensegrity spheres in the magnitude of two miles
diameter as now realizable for use as satellite environment
controls or as hemispherical, or other spherical segment,
earth contacting enclosures (in which the earth completes
the sphere),
e.g. for arctic city environment controls or as water
floatable enclosures.
</P>
<P>
Suspension bridge cables
are parallel to one another, and therefore give one
another no more anti-rhombic structural stability aid
than do the parallel tension wires of a barrel.
In Geodesic Tensegrities all the tension members
cross one another in great-circle-chorded triangulations,
thus providing highest possible dimensional stability.
For several well known reasons, there are ways in which
the Geodesic Tensegrity spheres
can be made to provide diameters way in excess of the
currently greatest suspension bridge span:
<ol>
<li>We know
that the progressive sub-division of a given metal fibre,
into a plurality of fibres, provides tensile capabilities
of the smaller fibres at increased magnitudes up
to hundreds and thousands-fold that of
the unit section. This is because of the increased
surface-to-mass ratios and because all tensile capability
is apparently invested in the surfaces
<A HREF="f21.html">[Fig. 21]</A>.
<li>The Geodesic Tensegrity spheres are
capable of mathematical treatment in such a manner as
to multiply the frequency of triangular modular
subdivision in an orderly 2nd power progression
and formulatic control.
</OL>
</P>
<P>
We now have the ability
to introduce the above orderly mathematics into the
electronic computor, which permits of practical calculation
and engineering "feasibility" previously non-existent.
This ability, combined with the fact that the higher the
frequency the smaller the tensional sectional area (yet
the higher the tensional capability, and the smaller the
local islands of compression),
allows us to states that the higher the frequency, the more
ephemeral the Tensegrity complex becomes. Also then, the
total weight of the structure required per given level of
performance grows
smaller, and the whole structure becomes less vulnerable to
total violations by any, or many, inwardly or outwardly
originating impinging forces.
</P>
<P>
The progression of
technical events described above alters all old engineering
concepts regarding the
relative increase in the overall weights of structures. These
now obsolete concepts gave early limits of practicality in
the relative increase of overall weights of structures which
occur when the overall linear dimensions are proportionally
increased. In
Egyptian pyramid buildings, doubling of the linear base
dimensions brought about a four-fold increase in the overall
surface and an eight-fold increase in the overall weight of
the pyramid, i.e. a linear dimension increase of two brings
about a second power
surface dimension increase of four and a concomitant third
power volumetric dimension increase of eight. Later when men
learned that the highest capability in strength of structures
existed in their surfaces, due to the greater action-reaction,
leverage
distance that opposite sides of the systems provided, they
hollowed out their buildings. They had previously only thought
of them as formalized solid compression warts on solid earth,
ergo the solid wats of Angkor Wat, or the ghats of Burma and
India and
the pyramids of Babylon and Egypt. But it is probable that
men had first hollowed out their log boats. Then centuries
later, they started to hollow out their buildings and after
that, many millenniums later, they began to hollow out their
sailing crafts' racing spars.
</P>
<P>
When later men learned that the structural
strength at the surface was not provided by
the "solid" quality of the exterior shell,
but by triangularly interstabilized lines of
force operative within that shell, they
perforated the shell with holes
between the force lines. The minimum holes were
triangular. The pattern of triangulated force lines,
peppered with triangular holes in the hollowed out structural
shell, became what we call a truss. We can say then, firstly,
that the hollowing our automatically reduced the third
power volumetric multiplication of
relative weight increase of structures as they increase in
respect to their primary linear dimensions. We can also say,
secondly, that the piercing of the shells with triangular
holes reduced the
solid or continuous surface of second power increase of
the shells, and brought the rate of structures' growth into
something nearer an overall first power or linear rate of
gain--for the force lines are only linear. When we introduce
the Tensegrity
structure and its many surprises already recounted, we see that
we have broken through to a structural knowledge and technique
which permits a progressively decreasing relative weight of
structure as proportioned to the linear gain. This is to
say, the gain of
weight in structures, as ratioed to basic linear dimensions,
is as one is to one minus 1/x weight ratio as the same
structure is multiplied in relative size.
</P>
<P>
In the above
progression, as frequencies go up, the sizes of the islands
of compression diminish.
Islands of compression are the only residual "solids" and
their diminishing size diminishes their relative weights at
a cube root progression of advantage. Halving the size of a
solid spar reduces its relative weight by eight. Halving the
size of a hollow
spar reduces weight by a factor of approximately four.
</P>
<P>
Reviewing somewhat, the higher the frequency the greater the
proportion of the structure that is invested in tensional
components. Tensional components are unlimited in length as
proportioned
to section ratios. As we increase the frequency, each tension
member is parted into a plurality of fibers, each of whose
strength is multiplied manyfold per unit of weight and
section. If we increase the frequency many times, the
relative overall weight
of structures rapidly diminishes, as ratioed to any given
linear increase, or <I>even</I> to any fixed linear increase, in
overall dimension of structure. The only limit to frequency
increase is the logistic practicality of more functions to
be serviced, but the
bigger the structure, the easier the local treatability
of high frequency components. In contrast to all previous
structural experience, the law of diminishing return is
operative in the direction of decreasing size of
Geodesic Tensegrity structures and
increasing return in the direction of their increasing
dimensions.
</P>

<H3>TENSEGRITY IN ATOMIC STRUCTURE</H3>
<P>
If the frequency
is high enough, the size of the interstices of the
Tensegrity net may become so relatively small as to
arrest the passage of any phenomena
larger than the holes. If frequency is high enough,
neither water nor air molecules can pass through.
They may be made to keep out the weather-complex
while admitting radar's microwaves and light, etc.
If we "up" the frequency sufficiently, we will decrease
the residual compressional islands to the microcosmic
magnitude of atoms, which only serves to disclose that
the atoms and their nuclei are themselves Geodesic
Tensegrity structures, ergo compatible with this
ultimate, frequency limit, a fact that is now
swiftly looming into the nuclear physicists' ken.
</P>
<P>
We now comprehend that the Tensegrity Geodesic structuring
provides the first true and visualizable model of pneumatic
structures in which the relative thickness of the enclosing
films, in proportion
to diameter, rapidly decreases with the increasing size
of the balloons.
</P>
<P>
In the case of the Geodesic
Tensegrity structures, however, no over-crowding of
interior gas molecules, imprisoned within a sub-molecular
mesh net, is necessary to thrust
the net's structure outward from its spherical
geometric center, because the compressional
struts, locally islanded, as outward thrusting
struts at both their ends, push the spherical
net outwardly at every vertexial advantage of
network convergence.
Geodesic Tensegrities are then "hollowed out" balloons,
discarding their redundantly "solid" air core.
</P>
<P>
The Geodesic Tensegrity is a hollowed our balloon,
in which those specific molecules of gas which happen
to be impinging from within against the skin a
t any one moment (thus pushing it outwardly) are
replaced by the islanded geodesic struts. It is possible
then to sew pockets on the inside surface of a balloon
skin corresponding in pattern to the islanded geodesic
struts and to insert stiff battens into
those pockets which cause the otherwise limp balloon
bag to take spherical shape as it would if filled with
a pressured-in gas <A HREF="f22.html">[Figs. 22-24]</A>.
</P>
<P>
Local stiffeners of
skin suitable to preferred activities, at any structural
focus, can be had by increasing
the inward-outward angular strut depths and the local surface
frequency patterning as well as by multi-layerings of surface
truss frequency--thus thickening the truss depth without
weight penalties. Here we have nature's own trick of local
stiffening as
accomplished by the higher frequency "closest packing" pattern
of isotropically moduled, local cartilages and even higher
frequency local bone structuring, as ratioed to the
frequency of tissue cells of animal flesh.
</P>
<P>
If we
employ hydraulic pressure within
the local islands of compression for dimensional
stability and gas molecules between the liquid
molecules for local compressibility, ergo flexibility,
we will find that our Geodesic Tensegrity structures
will, in every way, have taken advantage of the same
structural strategy principles employed by nature
in all her sizes of biological formulations.
</P>
<P>
Again reviewing somewhat: The progression of technical
events above described completely eliminates the old
engineering concepts of relative third power
increase in the weights of structures as dimensions
are doubled. We also see that Geodesic Tensegrities
accomplish all the fabulous lightweight characteristics
of pneumatic structures. They are true pneumatic structures
in purest designed frequency
principles without the disadvantage of the randomness and
redundance accruing to the inhert designer-ignorances
(which have only just happened to be successful), when
depending on sub-visible chemical structures' behaviors,
through the separation of all the
components into two majorly opposed magnitude classes, of
all the outward bound things that are too large to pass
through all the inward bound net holes that are in the
class that are too small. This is the same kind of
redundancy that occurs in reinforced
concrete, which if drilled out wherever redundant
components exist, would disclose an orderly, four
prime magnitude-complex, octahedron-tetrahedron truss
network, disencumbered of more than fifty percent of
weight. Tensegrity Geodesic spheroids have none
of the portal pressure lock problems of "solid-oozing"
pneumatic balloons. The pressure is discretely localized
and locked in place by the tension net, ergo cannot escape.
Tensegrity Geodesic spheroids may have several frequencies
simultaneously--a low
frequency major web and high frequency minor local web. If
Tensegrity Geodesic spheroids are of sufficiently high
frequency of secondary or minor webbing to exclude atmospheric
molecules, they may be partially vacuumized, ergo made
air-floatable without interior hot air or lighter-than-air
gas filling.
</P>
<P>
Because
of discontinuous compressions, local tensions in systems
may be methodically tautened or released in the Tensegrity
spheres which will permit the system to fold up as in the
pictures of the "Flying
Seed Pod" at Washington University as seen in the <I>St. Louis
Post Dispatch</I> item. In the Tensegrity spheres the turbining,
tensional, tripod vertexes replace the ball and socket
joints of the "Flying Seed Pod." Therefore, the structures
may be tightly bundled
in cigar shape for rocket, plane, helicopter or airship
deliveries.
</P>
<P>
The volumetric compression ratio between the
1000 sq. ft. great circle 36' diameter sphere, in open vs.
closed condition, is 3000 to 1. The 500,000 cubic foot
volume of a 100' diameter,
Tensegrity Geodesic sphere--with completely stable
environment--controlling,
structural chassis barrier upon which to mount
the secondary and tertiary, wave-frequency modulated,
sieve-mesh trusses--compresses, for rocket send-off,
or drone-flyable, "cigar" delivery packaging, into a
cylinder of 17 ft. length by 3 ft. diameter.
</P>
<P>
There are Tensegrity Geodesic structures suitable for
moon or independent satellite use (or any seed-pod
flight compactness and remote installation with
automated opening), whose enclosing, complex skin-mesh
trussing and structural-mesh trussing have
fixed-size dimensionsas referred to a common linear standard,
e.g. the international meter. They have a constant ratio
of the number of such fixed dimension components per given
unit area of local surface of the structure, regardless of
the overall sphere's
size. This local constancy of pattern sizing and distribution
ratioing is accomplished by modular frequency multiplications
in respect to a discretely dimensioned hierarchy of
progressively larger spheres. In such Tensegrity spheres
the weight per superficial
unitary area ( square foot, for instance) approaches
approximate constancy as the large spheres grow larger,
wherefore the cubic feet of volumetric enclosure accomplished
per unit weight (pounds) of enclosing structure multiplies
rapidly with the
increasing overall sphere sizing. Of course, the pounds of air
enclosed per pounds of structure also rapidly increase
(as is also true in respect to non-rigid balloons).
For instance, at sea level, one pound of structure,
of a Tensegrity sphere of a diameter
of one hundred feet, suitable to all the functions
herewith considered, encloses two and one-quarter
pounds of air. A one-hundred footer encloses twenty
tons of air, with nine tons of structure, for a
total displacement of twentynine tons. Each pound, of
a six thousand foot diameter Tensegrity sphere,
encloses one hundred and sixty-eight pounds of
air, i.e. a one and one-eighth mile diameter Tensegrity
Geodesic sphere (with an internal equatorial circular
area of one square mile and an external structural
surface of four square miles and girth of three and
one-half miles) encloses nearly five million tons of
air--with only fifty-six thousand tons of structure
(S.S. <I>Queen Mary</I>: 81,237 tons). The one-and-one-eighth-miler,
weighs only one percent of its air
cargo. Therefore only a minor reduction of interior air
pressure (in the latter case under 5%), inconsequential
to its structural capability, would so reduce gross
atmospheric displacement of the one and one-eighth
mile Tensegrity as to cause it to float
outward from earth--to various altitudes within the
earth's atmospheric envelope, proportional to the
interior percentage reduction of air content. If
partially emptied of air and refilled with helium,
it could float at considerable altitudes and remain
unsinkable except over long periods of slow leakage,
even though shot full of holes, as the interior gases
would not be under pressure, ergo tending to escape
(as they would in a, gravitationally-accelerated collapsing,
flexible-skinned balloon of the well
known pre-Tensegrity type).
</P>
<P>
Also because heat is an
energetic activity of molecules in geometrical patterning,
it is seen that, whereas the doubling of the diameter of
Tensegrity spheres makes eightfold the contained
molecular population (granted inside
vs. outside pressure constancy) while only making
fourfold the overall surface of its structure's skin.
That is with each doubling of size, there is only one
half as much surface area as before per each molecular
inhabitant, ergo only one half the previous
available exterior skin area per molecular inhabitant,
through which to effect the respective molecules' heat loss
activities by skin conduction, and the latter's secondary
radiation outwardly of the system. Ergo the larger the
Tensegrity the more
stable its thermal integrity, or total energetic integrity,
i.e. its relative energy conservation capability factor.
As a consequence of the foregoing, it is seen that when
very large Tensegrity spheres are exposed to the sun's
radiation, they may be made so
as to inhibit freely the heat wave frequencies, so
that the convexity of the interior surface opposite
the sun will reflect back inwardly to the sphere's
center some portion of the heat. This expands the
molecular domain-patterning and thereby pressure
expells through oneway skin valves various percentages
of the air molecule population, so lessening the overall
Tensegrity package weight displacement, and causing the
sphere to float outwardly into the atmosphere.
</P>
<P>
Such
consideration would have been utterly
impossible prior to the manifold structural weight
reduction accruing uniquely to the synergetically
surprising behavior of Geodesic Tensegrity sphere.
It is also seen that as the spheres go from larger
to larger, the secondary imposition of man-useful
apparatus weights are approximately negligible,
and inconsequential, to the overall buoyancy.
</P>
<H3>THE TECHNOLOGICAL BREAK-THROUGH</H3>
In discussing a
number of characteristics of Geodesic Tensegrities
that have no immediately obvious connection with
events outward
of earth's atmosphere, certain familiarization
is induced in respect to the envisionability of undertakings
having no precedent whatsoever.  Considering this previously
nonconsiderable earth-environment structural design,
and its realization capabilities, facilitates a clearer
understanding of the broad economic and industrial
logistics' strategic break-through that has been opened
by the Geodesic Tensegrities.
</P>
<P>
The whole theory of structures is both altered and
enormously expanded and implemented by my introduction
of mathematically coordinate and comprehensively operative
discontinuous-compression, continuous-tension structural
systems as inherent to Synergetic
Energetic geometry and its omni-rationality of vectorial,
ergo energy, accounting.
</P>
<P>
This break-through accrues
to an age-long, comprehensive emergence, and convergence,
of a myriad of world-around technico-economic, evolutionary
realizations originally
initiated only in the extraordinary moments of purely
poetical lucidities of man as ephemerally and only tenuously
accredited "could-be's," and thereafter gestated also by the
full range of inadvertent, incidental or accidental
accreditations by man.
</P>
<P>
With major dimensional expansion in unimpeded environment
controls, which are automatically self-erected in remote,
rocket-ferry-reached, installation locals, it may well be
practical, and possible, to install within giant Tensegrities
all the component
phenomena which enter into the regenerative cycles of
complementary chemical event patterning governing local
exchange balancing of oxygen and carbon molecules alternately
favorable to respective metabolic environments of animals and
vegetables.
</P>
<P>
A Tensegrity sphere, suitably skinned, may be capsule-folded for
rocket-borne release outside of earth's envelope with
automated opening. So that, if still within earth's
gravitational domain, it would return to the atmospheric
envelope as a Ping-pong ball
thrown upon the ocean, decelerating in approximating
frictionless subsidence to exquisite equilibrium, to
float around the outer atmospheric surface, as a ship
upon the sea, gradually leaking and submerging only if
its skin sieve mesh is not everywhere smaller
than the air molecules. If such a Tensegrity is of
adequate magnitude, it can be ballasted, contain importantly
large man activities and apparatus, and be rocket-propelled
in directional control for progressive positioning. It can
contain a small 100
ft. Tensegrity, in turn having an air concentration
tolerable to man, without important altitude loss.
</P>
<P>
The turbining, tensionally-interlaced joints of the
Tensegrity Geodesic spheroids also decrease the
star-like vertexial interference patterns,
the explanations of which are as follows:
</P>
<P>
When a
photostat is made of a plurality of lines crossing through
approximately one point, it is seen that there is a blurring
or running together of the lines near the point, causing a
web-like shadow between
the converging lines even though the lines had been
cleanly drawn. This is caused by a refractive, light-wave
bending. When the masses of the physically consisted lines
converge to critical proximity, the relative impedance of
light-wave passage in the
neighborhood of the point increases as of the second power
of the relative proximities as multiplied by a factor of
the relative-mass density. The Tensegrity Geodesic spherical
structures eliminate the heavy sections of compression
members in direct contact
at their terminals, ergo keep the heavy mass of
respective compressions beyond critical proximities.
As the vertexial connections are entirely tensional,
the section mass is reduced to a minimum, and frequency
increase provides a cube-root rate of
reduction of section in respect to each doubling frequency.
Thus very large or small Tensegrity Geodesic spheroids may
be designed with approximate elimination of all microwave
interferences--without in any way impairing their structural
dimensional stability.
</P>
<P>
It is thus patent that Geodesic Tensegrity spheroids may
be put in space, earthbound or earth atmosphere positions
to provide important local environment controls effectively
favorable to internal biological or instrumental functionings
and at obviously
highest efficiency of fundamental structural capability per
units of weight, time and energy therein invested.
