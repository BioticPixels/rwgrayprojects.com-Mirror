<P>
Pillow domes were invented by
<A HREF="http://www.wnet.org/archive/bucky/buckyworks.html">Jay Baldwin</A>.
See also
<A HREF="http://www.geniusloci.com/eco.html">
the film "Ecological Design: Inventing the Future"</A>.
He took 2 layers
of DuPont's Tefzel film and heat sealed them together.  He then took these
triangular shaped "air" pillows and attached them to the triangular
frame of a geodesic dome.  Once these thin film layers were attached
to the dome's frame, he injected a gas into the pillows.
</P>

<P>These Pillow Domes have a tremendous potential for providing
durable, transparent environmental enclosing structures while using
a minimum amount of material. They would be ideal for enclosing, for
example, water purification systems like those being developed
by
Dr. John Todd.

<P>
I am currently working with students at the State University of
New York (SUNY), Oswego campus to construct a 25 foot diameter
pillow dome.  Together with Prof. John Belt, I hope to construct
this dome with the students early next year.  Jay Baldwin will
be assisting us as our technical consultant.

Some of the advantages of a pillow dome over conventional
dome construction are
<UL>
 <LI>Flexable covering.  Uneven heating over the
 outside surface of the dome will cause
uneven expansion and contraction.  Because the thin films have
the ability to stretch this is not a problem for the
pillow domes.
 <LI>Water tight. Jay's method for attaching the thin  film insures that
the dome will not leak.  Leakage has been a problem in the past for
 convensional domes, mostly due to the joints becoming loose with the
uneven expansion and contraction mentioned above.
  <LI>Minimum shadow.
The
<A HREF="http://www.bio2.edu/">
Biosphere 2 </A>  project had a problem because
there wasn't enough sunlight passing through the dome surface/frame
to grow the food they wanted to.  With the pillow dome, we are approaching
the maximum amount of sun light passing through the dome to the
space enclosed.
 <LI> Maintanance.  Pillow domes require extreemely low maintenance.
 <LI> Better than single layer films.  Domes (or other structures)
covered with a single layer of film tend to "flap in the wind".  This
weakens the film which shortens its lifetime.  There is no flap with
Pillow domes.
 <LI> Better sound quality.  Because the interior surface of Pillow
domes are convex triangular bubbles, sounds inside the dome are
dispersed rather than focused as would be the case with a flat
or convex wall surface.

<P>
There are "problems" with pillow domes which need further
investigation.  These include
<UL>
<LI>Repair.  To repair a punctured pillow is not easy.  Its not
complex, but its not easy.
<LI>Its not a do-it-yourself type of project.  The pillows are made
by heat sealing at least two layers of film together.  The average
do-it-yourselfer doesn't have easy access to an impulse heat sealer.
But once you *have* the pillows heat sealed, the rest
is straight forward.
<LI>The size of the triangular pillows are unique for each size and frequency
dome.  It would be nice to be able to use "old" pillows in a new, different
sized dome, but the triangular framing of domes are different for
each change in radius and frequency.  This might be overcome by some
ingenious re-designning of dome framing.

<h2>List of Project Components...</h2>

<P>Here is a Table of Contents style list for the Pillow Dome Project
components
which I am exploring.

</ul>

<P>
NOTE: Jay reminds us that a key element in any dome project is
the foundation upon which the dome will be attached.  With
the air flow over the surface of the dome you can get a
large *lifting* force on the dome.  If it is not
securely fastened to the ground it *will* blow away.
