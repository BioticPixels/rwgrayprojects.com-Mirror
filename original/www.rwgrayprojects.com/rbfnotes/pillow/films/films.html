  <title>Notes to Jay Baldwin Type Pillow Dome Project</title>
 </head>

<h2 ALIGN="center">Thin Film Component </h2> 

<P>
The thin film component of the pillow dome is the covering 
for the dome which
seperates the interior from the exterior environment.  
The gas filled pillows also provide additional structural 
integrity.  Jay 
recommends using DuPont's Tefzel thin film.  
</P> 

<P>
Two layers of Tefzel are heat sealed together and a valve is inserted
to allow gas to be injected between the Tefzel layers.  This produces
an "air" pillow.  ("Air" is not used because in cold weather the 
moisture will condence and you will end up with water in the 
pillows.)  A third film between the two outer films may be added 
for insulation purposes.  (For example, 
<A HREF="http://www.southwall.com/index.html">Southwall Technologies'
</A>
 "Heat Mirror"
might be added as the third film between the two Tefzel films.  This
would decrease infra-red heat lose.)   
</P> 

<h2>Thin Film Requirements </h2> 

<P>
Here is a list of performance considerations which I will be using  
in evaluating the applicability of the film for pillow domes.  
Once the  performance list is created, a rating system can be developed to
determine which film is the "best" film to use.  This is not an
absolute rating system since some of the performance requirements
need to be strictly adheard to while others need not. 
</P> 

<ul>
 <li>No out gasing 
 <li>No UV-ray damage
 <li>High puncture and rip resistance 
 <li>High tensile strength 
 <li>High fire and flame resistance 
 <li>Recylceable at end of lifetime
 <li>High vapor barrier  
 <li>Health issues during construction  
</ul> 

<h2>Research Needed </h2> 

<P>
Research needs to be done to determine what is the best film
currently available for these Pillow Domes.  Some films that I am 
currently considering are listed below.  If you know of other 
films which should be investigated, please send me an e-mail note.

<P>
There are some web pages containning information on films which
need to be further researched for applicability to the pillow dome
project.

<H2>Film Puncture Tests </H2> 
<P>
We will be conducting a puncture test for each of the thin films
to be considered for use in the Pillow dome.  The "standard" for
comparison will be DuPont's Tefzel film, 5 mil thick (0.005 inches).
This is the material which Jay Baldwin has used in 
previous Pillow domes.  
</P> 

<P>
Two types of tests will be performed.  The first is a static
load test in which a round ball fixed at the end of a stiff rod    
 is placed in contact with the film.  
A force is increamently applied in descrete steps until
the ball breaks through the materail.  Data for balls of various  
diameters will be recorded and tabulated below.  
The second test is 
a dynamic puncture test.  The ball is raised a fixed distance above
the material and allowed to fall upon the film.  Varying the
weight attached to the ball will allow us to vary the force of
impact.    
</P> 


<H3>Static Test </H3>

<P>
Entries in the table give the applied force (lbs.) 
applied to the ball which resulted in the ball breaking through 
the film.
