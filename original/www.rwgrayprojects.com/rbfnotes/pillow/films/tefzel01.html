Pillow Dome Project: Tefzel

<h1>Tefzel</h1>
<P>Jay Baldwin, the inventior of Pillow Domes, recommends 
the use of
DuPont's Tefzel material.  Here is some information 
on Tefzel 
and Tefzel T2 
that I
have obtainned from DuPont.

<P>To order DuPont's Technical Data sheets on Tefzel and Tefzel T2 
you can call DuPont's Product Information at (800) 237-4357.

<H3>Tefzel T^2 </H3>

<P> 
DuPont has another clear film called Tefzel T^2 which has enhanced   
mechanical properties in the machined direction (MD).  We have considered
using the T^2 film for the pillow dome project, but we feel that 
more research would be needed for the T^2 film than for the "normal"
Tefzel material (which we know works from Jay Baldwin's experience.)

At least two properties of T^2 need further investigation
<UL>
<LI>Comparison of T^2 puncture resistance to "normal" Tefzel.
DuPont has done some "Impact Resistance" on T^2 and have reported their
results in their "T^2 Films of TEFZEL ETFE Technical Data" 
bulletin, but
there doesn't seem to be a direct comparison between Tefzel 
and Tefzel T^2. We will be conducting our own puncture test 
comparison at SUNY Oswego sometime in Oct. or Nov. of 1996.  
The results will be listed below. 
<LI>Heat sealing of T^2 is more of a problem than for "normal" 
Tefzel.
Heat sealing melts the material and so you loose the
enhanced properties of the film at the seam.  And because the 
T^2 film would be a thinner film (1.5 or 2.5 mil) the seams 
will be weaker. 
One solution might be to add more Tefzel 
along the seam as part of the heat sealing process.  So you end 
up heat sealing 2 layers of T^2 plus another layer or two 
(on the "top" and "bottom") of "normal" Tefzel just to make the 
seam thicker.  
</UL>

<P> Tefzel T^2 comes in roles up to 50 inches wide.

<P>
Note that in the machined direction, T^2 has a 
tensile strength of approx. 5 times the normal tensile 
strength.  This makes me wonder if it would
be possible to 
laminate two layers of T^2, 0.9mil thick, with one layer
rotated 90 degrees to the other layer to give a resulting material 
approx. 1.8mil thick and a tensile strength in either direction 
well over
34,000 psi.
