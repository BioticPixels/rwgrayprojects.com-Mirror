 <H4> Teflon&#174; PTFE </H4>
<BR> <I> Fluorocarbon Fiber </I> 
<UL> <BR>Product Description:  
<P> These fibers have an unusually high resistance to chemicals 
and heat, as well as exceptionally low levels of friction and 
adhesion. PTFE fibers are processed to a higher degree of molecular 
orientation than their resin counterpart. Thus the stress-strain 
properties and resistance to cold flow of the fiber are markedly 
different from those of the resin. PTFE fiber is available as 
continuous multifilament yarn, staple, and flock. The textile 
fibers can be either natural (brown) or bleached (white). Continuous 
filament products range in size from 200 to 1730 denier. Staple and 
flock are available in either 3.2 or 6.7 denier. PTFE fiber can be 
processed on most standard textile equipment.

product.
