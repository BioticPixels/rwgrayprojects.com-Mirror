       TITLE: The riddle of morphogenesis: a question of solution chemistry 
              or molecular cell engineering?.  (minireview)

   ABSTRACTS: The critical questions and scientific developments that have 
              led to the emergence of molecular cell engineering are 
              reviewed.  Researchers from many different disciplines have 
              come to realize that to understand function, we must return to 
              the elucidation of structures. However, the complex structures 
              of cell physiology cannot be explained by the molecular 
              biologist, the biophysicist, or the engineer alone. A single 
              researcher trained in molecular cell engineering could have 
              the necessary skills and knowledge to accomplish this aim.  
              The implications of this new field for graduate education and 
              the future of biology are explored.
