   ABSTRACTS: Mechanical stresses were applied directly to cell surface 
              receptors with a magnetic twisting device.  The extracellular 
              matrix receptor, integrin B1, induced focal adhesion formation 
              and supported a force-dependent stiffening response, whereas 
              nonadhesion receptors did not.  The cytoskeletal stiffness 
              (ratio of stress to strain) increased in direct proportion to 
              the applied stress and required intact microtubules and 
              intermediate filaments as well as microfilaments. Tensegrity 
              models that incorporate mechanically interdependent struts and 
              strings that reorient globally in response to a localized 
              stress mimicked this response.  These results suggest that 
              integrins act as mechanoreceptors and transmit mechanical 
              signals to the cytoskeleton. Mechanotransduction, in turn, may 
              be mediated simultaneously at multiple locations inside the 
              cell through force-induced rearrangements within a tensionally 
              integrated cytoskeleton. Copyright 1993 by the AAAS.
