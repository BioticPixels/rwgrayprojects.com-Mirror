    ABSTRACT: Michael Polanyi's 1958 book "Personal Knowledge" explains how 
              models and world views form the core of human life. The 
              paradigmatic context in which today's schools function derives 
              from an outmoded 19th-century agrarian economy. The new 
              millennium context turns around the explosion of information 
              technologies and the globalization of planet Earth. 
              Buckminster Fuller's synergy model can help transform public 
              education. (MLH)
