     ABSTRACT:  A face centered cubic (FCC) lattice of nucleons is shown to 
                have quantal characteristics identical to those of the 
                harmonic oscillator plus spin-orbit coupling model. A 
                nucleon's quantal values in the FCC lattice are determined 
                solely by the geometrical position of the nucleon. Despite 
                the contrary assumptions concerning the nuclear force, the 
                independent-particle model (i.e. shell model) and the FCC 
                model make identical predictions about the independent-
                particle nature of nuclei. The two theories can be 
                distinguished only by means of high energy, high resolution 
                diffraction experiments (55 Refs.)
