     ABSTRACT:  We demonstrate that there is a link between the underlying 
                geometrical structure in the Bloch-Brink alpha -cluster 
                model and shell structure in the axially-symmetric deformed 
                harmonic oscillator model. Indeed all the axially-symmetric 
                harmonic oscillator configurations can be related to 
                structures formed from triangular layers of alpha -clusters 
                whose centres lie on an FCC lattice. In particular all 
                harmonic oscillator closed-shell nuclei can be related to 
                tetrahedral arrangements of alpha -cluster centers, 
                generalizing the result known for /sup 16/O for many years. 
                These results suggest that the octupole degree of freedom 
                which can be associated with triangular and tetrahedral 
                alpha -cluster structures could be important in such nuclei 
                (29 Refs.)
