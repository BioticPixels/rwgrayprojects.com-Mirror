    ABSTRACT: Fuller offers insights into the meanings of industry and 
              technology and how they have acquired undeserved connotations. 
              He examines capitalism, enterprise, and integrity as 
              exemplified by Henry Ford and the consequences of the current 
              lack of integrity in industry. (SK)
