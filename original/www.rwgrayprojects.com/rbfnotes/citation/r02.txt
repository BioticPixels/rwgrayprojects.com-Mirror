     ABSTRACT:  Unique among models of nuclear structure, the face-centered-
                cubic (FCC) lattice model predicts the attenuation of the 
                periodic table at Z<110 and the impossibility of superheavy 
                nuclei. The total binding energies of superheavy nuclei in 
                the FCC model (109<Z<127) were calculated on the basis of 
                parameters obtained from a least-squares best-fit for 914 
                nuclei (Z<99). No indication of increased stability was 
                found for any of the transuranic elements (13 Refs.)
