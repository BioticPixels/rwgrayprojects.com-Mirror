     ABSTRACT:  The FCC crystalline model of nuclear matter has been 
                developed, based on the random phase approximation. The 
                simple calculation showed that the model may be justified. 
                The crystalline arrangement was mainly due to the attractive 
                part of the nuclear force. The statistical treatment used 
                was really relevant for heavy nuclei but could be extended 
                to light nuclei because the important factor is nuclear 
                density. Exchange was not examined, nor were dynamic 
                collective modes, but these could be added later (15 Refs.)
