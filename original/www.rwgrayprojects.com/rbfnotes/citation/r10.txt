     ABSTRACT:  In light of Lezuo's (see Z. Naturforschung, vol.30a, p.1018 
                (1975)) successful treatment of the elastic form factors for 
                /sup 16/O and /sup 40/Ca based upon a model of close packed 
                spheres, an FCC (face centred cubic) model for all nuclei is 
                proposed. The questions concerning the nuclear volume and 
                density and the theoretical values for the solidification of 
                nuclear matter are discussed. The known quantal features of 
                nuclei are found to correlate precisely with the FCC lattice 
                built from a tetrahedron. Shell, alpha particle and liquid 
                drop-like characteristics are described and finally a 
                largest possible nucleide at 166 neutrons and 106 protons is 
                predicted (11 Refs.)
