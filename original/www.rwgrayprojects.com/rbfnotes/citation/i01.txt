       TITLE: Radical Software. Number One. The Alternate Television 
              Movement.

    ABSTRACT: Some innovative ideas and applications for new television 
              technology are described in this tabloid format periodical. 
              Most of these ideas support the periodical's contention that 
              broadcast television is the most limited use of a developing 
              television technology which has the capability of being a 
              responsive medium and a valuable social tool and, as such, 
              should be open to all. The articles in this issue detail 
              experimental projects (both actual and proposed), provide 
              hardware information and an index of television innovators and 
              their ideas, list counter-culture videotapes and programs, and 
              explore some esoteric uses possible for the medium. Sample 
              articles include an interview with R. Buckminster Fuller, a 
              proposal for a paperless society, a critique of cable 
              television, and instructions on how to build an oscilloscope.
