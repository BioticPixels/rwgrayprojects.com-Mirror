     ABSTRACT:  A set of rules, involving the magic and semimagic values of 
                neutron and proton numbers and the proton/neutron ratio, is 
                formulated for the composition of the revolving clusters 
                producing the values of the moment of inertia given by the 
                differences in energy of the adjacent levels in quasibands 
                and bands of nuclei. The cluster compositions assigned with 
                use of these rules to isotopes of Kr, Sr, Zr, Mo, and the 
                actinon nuclei and to successive levels of the ground-state 
                band of /sup 158/Er lead to reasonable values of the radius 
                of revolution (the distance from the center of the 
                nonrevolving sphere to the center of the cluster). These 
                values correspond to a spheron diameter of about 3.20 fm 
                (11 Refs.)
