     ABSTRACT:  Values of R, the radius of rotation of the rotating cluster, 
                are calculated from the observed values of the energy of the 
                lowest 2/sup +/ states of the even isotopes of Cd, Sn, and 
                Te with the assumption that the cluster is alpha , p/sup 2/, 
                and alpha , respectively. R shows a maximum at 
                approximately=N=58, a minimum at approximately=N=62, and a 
                second maximum at approximately=N=70. The increase to the 
                first maximum is interpreted as resulting from the 
                overcrowding of spherons (alphas and tritons) in the mantle 
                (outer layer) of the nuclei, causing the cluster to change 
                from rotating in the mantle to skimming over its surface; 
                the decrease to the minimum results from the addition of 
                three dineutrons to the core, expanding the mantle and 
                permitting the rotating cluster to begin to drop back into 
                it; and the increase to the second maximum results from the 
                overcrowding of the larger mantle surrounding the core 
                containing the semi-magic number 14 of neutrons rather than 
                the magic number 8 for N=50. The decrease after the second 
                maximum results from the further increase in the number of 
                core neutrons to 20 (20 Refs.)
