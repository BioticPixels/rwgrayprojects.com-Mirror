     ABSTRACT:  The symmetries of an antiferromagnetic face-centered-cubic 
                lattice with alternating isospin layers reproduces 
                simultaneously several one- and two-dimensional spin- and 
                isospin-ordered states which have previously been shown to 
                be low energy configurations for a condensed nuclear phase. 
                The face-centered-cubic lattice also shows a precise 
                correspondence with the j-j model and, consequently, the 
                entire nucleon buildup procedure of the independent-particle 
                model. It is concluded that the study of nuclear condensates 
                at normal nuclear densities should begin with the face-
                centered-cubic configuration (30 Refs.)
