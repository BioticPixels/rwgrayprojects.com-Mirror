     ABSTRACT:  The authors present a model of the nucleus suggesting that 
                nucleons may 'condense' into a particular kind of 
                crystalline array, namely a face-centred cubic (FCC) 
                lattice. This is a standard crystal structure in which the 
                basic unit consists of a cube with atoms at each corner and 
                at the centre of each face. This model can reproduce all the 
                symmetries implied by the shell model. In addition, as in 
                any solid model, the interaction between particles must be 
                predominantly between nearest neighbours. The FCC model, 
                therefore, maintains this fundamental property of the liquid-
                drop model. Moreover, in the FCC model, one can regard any 
                nucleus either as a small lattice of nucleons or as an 
                aggregate of 'sublattices' corresponding to alpha particles. 
                This produces an 'alpha-particle texture' throughout the 
                interior of the nucleus and on its surface. The crystalline 
                model thus reproduces simultaneously the main features of 
                the gaseous, liquid and semi-solid models (0 Refs.)
