     ABSTRACT:  As an alternative to their description as vibrational 
                levels, the low excited states of even-even nuclei can be 
                described as rotational states of a helion, dineutron, 
                diproton, or other cluster about the rest of the nucleus, 
                leading to reasonable values of the average distance between 
                centers of the clusters. Some states involve rotational 
                excitation of two or more helions or other clusters. The 
                nature of the rotating clusters is determined by the 
                relation of the neutron and proton numbers to the magic 
                numbers
