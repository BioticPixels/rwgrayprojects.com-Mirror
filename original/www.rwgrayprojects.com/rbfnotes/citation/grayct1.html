<TITLE>Robert W. Gray's R. Buckminster Fuller Notes</TITLE></HEAD>

<H1 ALIGN="center">Citations to Fuller's Work</H1>
<BR>
<P>While studying Fuller's work, I did a literature search to see if
anyone had done a critical review of Fuller and his work.  At the
time, I was interested in learning what impact Fuller's work
has had on the academic community.  This lead me to compose a list
of references to articles which reference R. Buckminster Fuller.
The source for these citations was the Science Citation Index and the
Social Science Citation index.  The results are two listings below
which you may view by clicking on the appropriate names.
</P>
<P>My conclusion from looking at these citations as well as
the papers themselves is that aside from one critical review of
Fuller's philosophy, the sciences and humanities have not done
a <I>thorough</I> critical analysis of Fuller's work. </P>

<P>The citations are NOT up to date.  I stopped cataloging references
some years ago.  One reason for this is that CD-ROM technology makes
it very easy to search for references.  However, I still think these
listings may be of value to some people so I offer them to you here. </P>

<P>Here is a collection of other references which mention R. 
Buckminster Fuller which includes some articles writting by 
Fuller. </P>

Because there is interest in models based on a polyhedral approach to
molecules, atoms, nuclei, and the "zoo" of particles discoved by physicists,
I have collected an assortment of references to papers related to this topic.
Most of these papers do not reference R. B. Fuller and so do not occur in the
other two Citation lists.

<H2 ALIGN="center">Sources For Obtaining Information </H2>  
<P>Seeing these citations may prompt some
people to ask "Now that I know the book or journal article is out there, how do
I obtain a copy?"  I therefore offer a brief review of sources for obtaining
books and articles that I have found to be indispensable.</P>
<P>First and foremost, check your local library.  This need not be a
University or College library, but they usually have a larger collection of
books and journals.  If you don't find what you are looking for in the library,
don't despair.  Ask the Reference Librarian if the book or article can be
ordered from another library.  In the libraries that I have dealt with, this
was done through what is called the Inter-Library Loan program.  I have been
able to obtain ALL of R. Buckminster Fuller's books and copies of many journal
articles through these Inter-Library Loan programs.  Some libraries charge a
small fee for each item ordered.  I know of no other way of obtaining journal
articles that are not in the library.</P>
<P>If you want to buy the book, check your local book stores.  If you
can not find what you are looking for, which happens to me a lot, the first
thing to do is to find out if the book is still in print.  This can be done by
looking up the book's title or author in the Books In Print catalogs.  This is
a listing of all the books currently in print and available from the publishers.
Ask the Reference Librarian where it is located in your library.  Then find a
local book store that is willing to special order books from the publishers.
I have purchased many books that I could not find on the bookshelves by special
ordering them.  Depending on the book store, it can take anywhere from one week
to two months to obtain the book.</P>
<P>If the book is out of print (and therefore, not available from the
publishers), look in the yellow pages of the phone book for a book store that
deals in out of print books.  If you are lucky there will be a good out of
print book store close by.  If you do not find what you are looking for at the
out of print book store then ask if they provide an out of print book search service.
Some "non-out-of-print" bookstores also provide this service as well.  If they do
provide this service, they will place an ad for the book you want in an out of print
book dealer's magazine.  I have been able to obtain a copy of Fuller's 1938
book Nine Chains To The Moon as well as other fine treasures by using this service.
It may take many months to find the book you are looking for.</P>
<P>Another source of information is the Buckminster Fuller Institute.  You can
purchase some books, audio and video tapes, and other interesting material from
them.</P>
<P>Also, back at the library, ask the Reference Librarian for the Audio
and Video Tape catalogs.  I have been able to find several tapes of Fuller's
lectures and one video of R. Buckminster Fuller through these catalogs.</P>
<P>And, of course, surf the internet/web.  There are now book search
services available through these computer networks.</P>
<P>I hope that this will provide you with enough sources to obtain the
information that you are looking for.</P>
