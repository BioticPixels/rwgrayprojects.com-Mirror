    ABSTRACT: In this anthology of readings, 28 scholars and educators 
              consider the theoretical and practical forces that shape the 
              concept of lifelong learning. After Ronald Gross's 
              introduction, the first section begins its consideration of 
              the Western tradition in adult learning with Plato's metaphor 
              of the cave and includes Pico della Mirandola's essay on 
              individual development, Benjamin Franklin's brief description 
              of the founding of the experimental "Junto," and Robert 
              McClintock's affirmation of a lifelong course of study. In 
              Part II, Margaret Mead, Mortimer Adler, Paulo Freire, Eduard 
              C. Lindeman, and Fred Harrington discuss lifelong learning as 
              a contemporary imperative, underscoring the lateral 
              transmission of knowledge, the benefits that maturity bring to 
              learning, and American achievements in adult education. 
              Leaders in the field of adult education, including Cyril 
              Houle, Malcolm Knowles, Allen Tough, Carol Aslanian and Henry 
              Brickell, and Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi, identify types of 
              lifelong learners, consider the education of adults, stages in 
              adult lives, and the role of learning for adults. In Part IV, 
              practices in the field of adult education are considered by 
              Samuel Brightman, Frank Adams, Carl Rogers, Jerold Apps, and 
              Patricia Cross. The book concludes with a series of articles 
              on the future learning world by James Botkin, Mahdi Elmandjra, 
              and Mircea Malitza; Frank Spikes; a group of adult educators 
              convened by Basic Choices; Buckminster Fuller; and Kenneth 
              Boulding. (AYC)
