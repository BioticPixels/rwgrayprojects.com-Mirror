     ABSTRACT:  A new approach to nuclear interactions has been investigated 
                on the basis of a coloured quark exchange model. The model 
                is consistent with quantum chromodynamics and requires the 
                existence of three-body and four-body interactions between 
                nucleons, but only in states with antisymmetric SU(4) 
                symmetry. This approach provides a method for calculating 
                many properties of nuclei, gives many qualitative features 
                of the nucleon-nucleon interaction, automatically yields 
                saturation, but requires the alpha -particle to have 
                tetrahedral symmetry. Even-even nuclei up to A=24 have been 
                considered with particular emphasis on /sup 12/C and /sup 
                16/O. Remarkable agreement with experiment has been achieved 
                not only for ground state properties but also for excited 
                states. A successful synthesis of rotations, vibrations, 
                cluster states, and single-particle motion appears to have 
                been attained. Unusually accurate values of the total 
                binding energies have been predicted for even-even nuclei. 
                Qualitative discussions of the possible ramifications of the 
                present theory for heavier nuclei are also included 
                (49 Refs.)
