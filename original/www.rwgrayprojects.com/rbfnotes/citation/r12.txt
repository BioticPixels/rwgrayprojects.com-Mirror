     ABSTRACT:  The energy is minimized, as a function of particle density 
                and coupling of a class of two-parameter single particle 
                orbitals which explicitly satisfy the full Hartree-Fock 
                equations for occupied states in the thermodynamic limit. A 
                delta -function internucleon potential yields stabler states 
                than the plane-wave Hartree-Fock solutions, for sufficiently 
                strong coupling and/or high density. Minimizing the energy 
                with respect to the free parameters gives either first- or 
                second-order transitions, with bifurcation of the new energy 
                state from the old. The relevance of the model to neutron 
                star and nuclear star matter, to the possibility of 
                Pauling's 'close-packed spheron' structure, and to the 
                electron-gas problem is discussed (10 Refs.)
