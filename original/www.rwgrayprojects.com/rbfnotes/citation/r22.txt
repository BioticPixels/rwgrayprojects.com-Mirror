     ABSTRACT:  Values of R, the radius of rotation of the rotating cluster, 
                are calculated from the energy of the lowest 2/sup +/ level 
                of even-even nuclei with the assumption that the cluster 
                consists of p/sup 2/ or n/sup 2/ respectively, for N or P 
                magic, and of a helion ( alpha ) for N or P differing from a 
                magic number by +or-2. The values as a function of A show a 
                zigzag course, which is correlated with the polyspheron 
                structure of the nuclei. If the mantle is not overcrowded 
                the rotating cluster moves within the mantle. When the 
                mantle becomes overcrowded the cluster glides over the 
                surface of the mantle and the value of R increases by one 
                spheron diameter, about 3.2 fm. At certain values of N a 
                change in structure of the nucleus occurs, with increase in 
                radius of the core by half a spheron diameter, permitting 
                the cluster to drop back into the mantle, with decrease in R 
                by half a spheron diameter (10 Refs.)
