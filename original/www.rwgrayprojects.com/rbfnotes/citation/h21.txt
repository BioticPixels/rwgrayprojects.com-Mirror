    ABSTRACT: A global newsletter on futuristic communications, media and 
              networking is dedicated to creating open, humanistic 
              environments for better interpersonal communication and to 
              exploring the phenomenon of synergy, the coming together of 
              people, ideas and environments for creation of something 
              greater than the sum of the parts. Editorials, poetry, and art 
              work express and expand the concept of synergy. Events ranging 
              from a pleasure fair to a workshop on comprehensive, 
              anticipatory design science are announced. An article on 
              telephonics describes the equipment for telephone conferences 
              and classroom calls. A directory of learning exchanges and 
              computerized networks functions as a clearinghouse for 
              techniques and programs related to automated learning 
              exchanges. A survey of computer conferencing systems 
              identifies those attempting to hold a conference over weeks or 
              months with an unlimited number of people. Notes on current 
              news, books, and periodicals offer ideas on communication 
              techniques ranging from utilization of radio to cable 
              television. The newsletter is published six times a year; 
              yearly subscriptions are $5.00. (KSM)
