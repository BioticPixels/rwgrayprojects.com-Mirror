     ABSTRACT:  There is an unambiguous geometrical representation of 
                nuclear 'quantum space' which is analogous to the electron 
                orbitals of the hydrogen atom. In both the atom and the 
                nucleus, the position of each fermion relative to the axes 
                of 'quantum space' is dependent upon the particle's 
                eigenvalues. In the nuclear realm, the geometry of 
                eigenstates corresponds precisely with the symmetries of an 
                antiferromagnetic face-centred cubic (FCC) lattice with 
                alternating isospin layers. The correspondence between the 
                eigenstates of the Schrodinger equation and the FCC lattice 
                is demonstrated and the relationship between the spin-orbit 
                model and the FCC model is discussed. The random-phase-
                approximation (RPA) technique is used to examine the ground 
                and excited states of the FCC lattice (28 Refs.)
