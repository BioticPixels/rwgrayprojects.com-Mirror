     ABSTRACT:  A theorem concerning fermion interaction is postulated and 
                applied to the problems of atomic (electronic) and nuclear 
                physics. Model building based solely upon the postulate that 
                adjacent like fermions must be singlet paired accounts for 
                the closed shells of both nuclear and atomic structure. The 
                implied antiferromagnetic FCC lattice of protons and 
                neutrons in alternating layers has been found previously to 
                be the lowest-energy solid configuration of nuclear matter 
                (N=P) (Canuto and Chitre, 1974). The buildup of the FCC 
                lattice from a central tetrahedron reproduces all of the 
                shells and subshells of the isotropic harmonic oscillator, 
                which of course is the basis for the shell model. In atomic 
                structure, the singlet pairing of adjacent electrons implies 
                closed-shell structures uniquely at the six noble gases and 
                the three noble metals, Ni, Pd, and Pt. The basis for the 
                postulate concerning fermions is found in terms of classical 
                electrodynamics; it is a microscopic corollary of Biot-
                Savart's law that parallel currents attract whereas 
                antiparallel currents repel (34 Refs.)
