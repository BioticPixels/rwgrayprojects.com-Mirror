<P>
This is a listing of papers which I have found which relate to various
models of cell structure, molecules, atoms, nuclei, and particles which are based
in some way on polyhedra, crystal, closest packing, tensegrity or other R.B. Fuller
like approaches to these subjects.  If you have other references which you 
think may be of interest, please let me know and I will add them to the list.
This list is in no particular order.

Also of interest are the works of Steve Combs, who has done some work matching
polyhedra with masses of elementary particles, and S. Martin Waterman, who has
done extensive studies of closest packing of spheres.  I do not know of any
published papers by these people but I suspect you can contact them through
the Buckminster Fuller Institute.
