     ABSTRACT:  For part I see ibid., vol.97A, no.1, p.157, (1987). An 
                isomorphism was shown to exist between the known nucleon 
                eigenvalues and the symmetries of an antiferromagnetic face-
                centred cubic (FCC) lattice of protons and neutrons. Based 
                upon the exact correspondence between nucleon states and 
                positions in the FCC lattice, the properties of individual 
                nuclei can be deduced with few additional assumptions or 
                empirical input. Here, nuclear RMS radial values and binding 
                energies of isotopes across the periodic chart have been 
                determined. Nuclear 'skin' parameters and the excited states 
                of selected nuclei have also been calculated and demonstrate 
                the realistic nature of FCC model predictions. Attenuation 
                of the periodic chart at Z<110 is predicted and a brief 
                comparison with other solid phase nuclear models is made 
                (20 Refs.)
