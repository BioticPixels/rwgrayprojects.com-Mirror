    ABSTRACT: R. Buckminster Fuller's World Game is a scientific means for 
              discovering the expeditious ways of employing the world's 
              resources to provide a higher standard of living for all 
              humanity. The philosophy behind the game is the exploration of 
              resources to do more with less, or to combine two or more 
              actions to produce a result greater than the sum of the two. 
              The goal is to give man the right to life instead of having to 
              earn it. The goal, philosophy, and computer technology of the 
              World Game can also be applied to world health planning. 
              Health is an individual right and all humanity must have the 
              opportunity to enjoy life to the fullest. In order to develop 
              world health planning, the planner must take full advantage of 
              computer simulation to test data and possible health care 
              strategies. For maximum efficiency, planning and research, 
              agencies must be integrated. Politics will be the largest 
              pragmatic obstacle to world planning since politicians are 
              often slow-moving and evasive about dealing with death and 
              disease. The primary philosophical obstacle is goal-defining. 
              The World Game can help plan to get somewhere, but it can not 
              tell us where we want to go. (Author/DE)
