    ABSTRACT: The document is comprised of four newsletters which present a 
              collection of essays, practical teaching methods, and learning 
              activities introducing future studies into the classroom. 
              Aimed at primary and secondary teachers, subject areas include 
              forecasting methods, curriculum implementation and evaluation, 
              innovative teaching materials and strategies, computer-based 
              instruction, energy usage and conservation, planning, 
              technological literacy, and alternative education. The 
              December 1977 issue discusses energy and the necessity for 
              energy education, covering nuclear energy, teaching guidelines 
              and ecological concepts, lesson plans developing creative 
              capacities, a unit interrelating air pollution and math 
              concepts, solar energy, a communication game, and 
              bibliographies. The April 1978 issue chooses the best fourteen 
              articles from past issues, including the definition and 
              educational roles of a futurist, student attitudes toward 
              future studies, the relevance of future studies, several games 
              and other teaching methods. The Fall 1978 issue offers eight 
              articles, discussing topics such as educational objectives and 
              learning activities for energy conservation curriculum, a 
              futures approach to teaching history, group grading, and the 
              need for alternative decisional and problem solving approaches 
              in future studies curriculum. The Spring 1979 issue presents 
              essays exploring the future of education, Buckminster Fuller's 
              synergetic approach, the role of science and technology in our 
              society, and some pitfalls of educational futurism. It 
              includes two futures learning activities and two examples of 
              research in educational futurism. (CK)
