     ABSTRACT:  FCC model predictions of nuclear RMS charge radial values 
                are compared with empirical data for 341 isotopes across the 
                periodic table. Using only one adjustable parameter the mean 
                error is 1.55%, as compared with 1.42% in the extended 
                liquid-drop model where three such parameters are required. 
                The FCC model also implies a diffuse nuclear surface, a 
                feature that demands ad hoc adjustments in other models, but 
                is inherent in the FCC build-up procedure (15 Refs.)
