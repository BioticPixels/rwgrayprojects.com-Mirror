    ABSTRACT: An approach to teaching American studies at a Southern 
              institute of engineering technology is described. The 
              curriculum of this school is technically oriented to the 
              professional engineer. Elective humanities courses must 
              attract their own market and justify their places to both the 
              students and the faculty. Two courses entitled "Man and 
              Technology" and "History of American Technology" have been 
              developed to humanistically study the role of technology in 
              our culture and to fit in with the present curriculum. The 
              first course is conducted as a colloquium with emphasis placed 
              on student participation. The course contains eight units 
              which focus on the images that motivate role behavior, the 
              ideology of technology, the theory of the artifact as social 
              action and performance, the moral responsibility of 
              technology, the philosophy of Buckminster Fuller, Frank Lloyd 
              Wright's organic view of nature, personal space and the 
              behavioral basis of design, and Erich Fromm's philosophy of a 
              humanized technology. Student and faculty response to the 
              course has been favorable. (DE)
