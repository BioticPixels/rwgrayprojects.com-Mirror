     ABSTRACT:  The classical part of a new microscopic model of nuclear 
                structure based on high spatial symmetry is proposed. The 
                isomorphic model, as it is called, is a model of the closed-
                shell nuclei up to /sup 208/Pb at the ground state. In 
                brief, it assumes stable dynamic equilibrium of nucleons on 
                spherical shells, which results in shells having average 
                shapes represented by high symmetry polyhedra derived from 
                one another, whose vertices represent average nucleon 
                positions. Properties successfully examined by application 
                of this classical part alone are nuclear shells and magic 
                numbers, nuclear radii, nuclear density, and ground-state 
                moments of inertia of rotating nuclei based on a closed-
                shell approximation (13 Refs.)
