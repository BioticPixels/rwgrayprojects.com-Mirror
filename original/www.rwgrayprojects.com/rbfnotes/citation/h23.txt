    ABSTRACT: Describes the teaching of geodesic-dome concepts to students 
              in grades 3-5 through the trial use of Energetic and 
              Synergetic Geometry as well as the undertaking of a workshop 
              designed to prepare elementary and secondary school teachers 
              to conduct further experiments. (CC)
