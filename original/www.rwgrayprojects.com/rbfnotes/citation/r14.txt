     ABSTRACT:  A study of the binding energies of 1236 nuclei has been made 
                in the framework of four lattice models, and compared with 
                independent-particle and liquid-drop model results, The most 
                realistic of the lattice models was a face-centred cubic 
                (FCC) close packing of nucleons using nine adjustable 
                parameters, each of which has a clear physical 
                interpretation relating to two-body nucleon interactions. 
                The numerical performance of the lattice models relative to 
                the liquid-drop model (25 adjustable parameters) and the 
                independent-particle model (471 adjustable parameters) is 
                discussed (29 Refs.)
