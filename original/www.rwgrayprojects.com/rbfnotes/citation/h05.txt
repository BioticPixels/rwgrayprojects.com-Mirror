    ABSTRACT: In a holistic approach to education, the various parts are 
              related to the whole in such a way that education is no longer 
              fragmented and unrelated to the larger society. Because it is 
              difficult to define what is meant by the term "holistic," 
              educators have been hesitant to use such an approach even 
              though a growing body of literature supports the validity of 
              such educational concepts. Holistic education emphasizes the 
              need to develop a sensitivity to the process of one's own 
              thoughts and feelings, and those of others. Implicitly and 
              explicitly, holistic education emphasizes the common humanity 
              of all people and the essential unity of life. Buckminster 
              Fuller, Fritjof Capra, Lewis Thomas, David Bohm, and E. F. 
              Schumacher have all discussed the need for a more holistic 
              approach to life and education. Educators, however, have 
              avoided dealing with interconnections among phenomena and 
              people, preferring to maintain boundaries between disciplines 
              and avoiding personal matters altogether. What is needed is a 
              holistic approach that emphasizes those interconnections and 
              could even provide the basis for a new approach to teaching 
              values. (IS)
