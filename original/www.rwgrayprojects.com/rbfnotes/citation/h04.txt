    ABSTRACT: By using the kind of two-way television system envisioned by 
              Buckminster Fuller, school children can learn at their own 
              rates and select interesting topics, thereby continually 
              reinforcing the desire to learn. Today's new interactive video 
              systems, from multimedia encyclopedias to hypermedia 
              combinations, allow students to explore subject matter in any 
              order and at any depth desired. (MLH)
