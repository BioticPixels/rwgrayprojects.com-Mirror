<H1 ALIGN="center">Errata for Fuller's Synergetics</H1>
<BR>
<P>The following is a list of errors, misprints and, I hope,
corrections to Fuller's Synergetics books.  Most of these entries
were identified by Chris Fearnley and myself back in (about) 1991.
But I have added some things since then.  If you have other corrections
to the Synergetics books please send me an e-mail note and I will
add your items to this list.  </P>

<P>
Ed Applewhite has recently reviewed some notes made by R. Buckminster Fuller
w.r.t. corrections to the Synergetics books.  Here are these corrections.
</P>
<P ALIGN="center">
<A HREF="edapple1.html">From Ed's Files</A><BR></P>
</P>

<P>This errata is for the 3rd printing of Synergetics.  The 1st printing
contains additional errors corrected in later printings.</P>
<P>Because of the limited mathematical symbol ability of current WWW viewers
I have used what I hope are obvious abbreviations when necessary. I use
<I>both</I> "**" and "^" symbols for "to the power of".</P>

<H2>Corrections to Synergetics: </H2>
<P><UL>

as it says in the caption below the figure or the caption should be changed
to "Zero-Frequency".

<LI>page    , 905.17, When the icosahedron is "dimpled", the dimpled
vertex goes <I>past</I> the icosahedron's center of volume.  Fuller
incorrected states that it stops before passing through the center 
of volume. (From Denis F. Blue) 
<LI>page 494, 905.45, "See Illus. 950.30" should be "See Fig. 950.31"?
<LI>page 106 and page 789, Fig. 401.05 and Illus. 401.00 are wrong. One
of the compressional members in the upper righthand corner has 5 tension
members attached to it.  It should only have 4 tension members.

<LI>page 251, 986.312, last sentence should read "Their three surface
corners are 90 degrees at C, 58.2825256 degrees at B, and 31.71747441

<LI>page 292, 986.581, it should read "edge length 0.9995V" and "surface

<H2>Other Errors:</H2>
<P>
<UL>
<LI>Typo in related table 986.440 of Synergetics 2: says
Coupler has 18 B-mods.  Should read 8 B-mods. (Kirby Urner)
</UL>
</P>

<H2>Additional Commentary:</H2>
<P>
<UL>
<LI>page 540 of Synergetics, "Illus. 953.10" is hard to find.  It is
found on page 806 and called "Fig. 953.10...".
<LI>page 557 of Synergetics, 961.11, y=sqrt() x=sqrt() are for the regular
tetrahedron.
<LI>Often Fuller implies that dividing the sum of the surface angles
of a polyhedron by 720 degrees (one tetrahedron) gives an integer
result (is evenly divisible by 720 degrees.)  This is not correct. For
example, take 2 regular tetraheda and face bond them together.  Now
we have a polyhedra with sum of surface angles = 2x3x60+3x4x60=1080,
1080 / 720 = 1.5 which is not an integer (but is a rational number.)
So the sum of the surface angles of convex polyhedra need not be
evenly divisible by 720 degrees.
