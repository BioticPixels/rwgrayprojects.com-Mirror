<BODY BGCOLOR="white">
<H1 ALIGN="center">Corrigendum for Fuller's Synergetics</H1>
<BR>
<P>The following is a set of corrections to the Synergetics books which R. Buckminster
Fuller indicated to Ed Applewhite should be made. 
</P>

<H2>
ADDENDUM at sec 1033 ff
</H2>
<P>
[RBF holograph made at Halekulani Hotel, Honolulu (where RBF and EJA were
working together), 18 November 1977.  RBF instructed that this statement was
to be inserted "humblingly" as a Footnote at sec 1033.13531 of MS draft of
the same date.]
</P>
<P>
{EJA note: Section 1033.13531 did not survive with that number in the final
text of SYNERGETICS 2.  Eventual recourse to the SYNERGETICS drafts in the
Fuller archives may establish the actual passage where RBF wanted the
footnote inserted.  Despite this uncertainty, RBF's draft is an important
documentation of our modus operandi.]
</P>
<H3>
FOOTNOTE:
</H3>
<P>
This series of errors which compounded to produce the ninth power of the
synergetics value of the sphere seems retrospectively impossible to have
occurred.  But all the ramifications of their occurrence are now clearly
traceable in the first and second printings of SYNERGETICS.
</P>
<P>
My colleague E.J. Applewhite in his excellent book COSMIC FISHING (Macmillan
[1977]) chronicles his patient, bemused, and amused reviewing of our
production of SYNERGETICS 1.That SYNERGETICS 1 had as few booboos as it did
is due in great measure to E.J. Applewhite's tireless attention.  He never
questioned, however, my arithmetic itself, which he knew I always undertook
to check with great care.  E.J. Applewhite, in trying to account for this
running-off-the-track to "Sphere 5" episode, recalls that at the time that it
occurred the one and only lapose of my good health of the last three-quarters
of a century occurred when I went exhausted into a St. Lous hospital for a
check-up which a week of the doctors' probing showed only that I was
superfatigued, and that a mild case of pericarditis had set in which vanished
with a week's absolute rest.
</P>

CORRIGENDA at sec 982.54 ff

of the rhombic triacontrahedron have the same volumetric quanta value as the
A and B Quanta Modules; the rhombic triancontrahedron volume is five.

[EJA note: As far as my record show, the above corrigenda are the only
corrections made by RBF by hand in my copies of SYNERGETICS.  They should be
read in conjunction with RBF'S floating addendum for 1033.135, made at about
the same time (separate posting).]
