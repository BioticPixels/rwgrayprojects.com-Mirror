   Tetrahelix Axes Passing Thru A Single Tetrahedron
</H2>

<p>
We know that the symmetry axis of a Tetrahelix passing through a Tetrahedron's triangular 
face must pass through a triangle face coordinate (7, 3).  

 <a href="proof73.html">
  (See this web page for details.)
 </a>

</p>

<p>
We highlight the 3 (7,3) traingle face coordinates by drawing a red triangle.

<div align="center">
 <img src="figures/73coord.jpg">
</div>

</p>


<p>
We divide all 4 faces of the Tetrahedron into a 10-frequency grid and draw the (7,3) 
tirangles in red.

</p>


<div align="center">
 <img src="figures/Tetra02.jpg">
</div>

<p>
We next connect all the vertices of the red triangles to all other red triangle vertices.
</p>

<p>
Since we know that the Tetrahelix symmetry axis passes into a Tetrahedron and out of a 
Tetrahedron through only these (7,3) positions, some of these lines must be the
symmetry axes for all possible Tetrahelix passing through this Tetrahedron.
</p>

<div align="center">
 <img src="figures/AllLines01.jpg">
</div>


<p>
We also know that this symmetry axis passes by the center of volume of the Tetrahedron 
at a distance of (sqrt(2)/10)EL. 


 <a href="COVtoAxis.html">
  (See this web page for details.)
 </a>

</p>

<p>
So we place a sphere with this radius value at the center of volume of the Tetrahedron.
</p>

<div align="center">
 <img src="figures/AllLines02.jpg">
</div>

<p>
The lines which pass the sphere at a tangent point on the sphere will be a 
symmetry axis for a Tetrahelix.  These lines will be shown in green.
</p>

 <img src="figures/TangentLines03.jpg">
</div>

<p>
There are 12 green lines, so there are 12 Tetrahelix passing through
a single Tetrahedron. Six of these will have a Clockwise screw sense and 6
will have a Counter Clockwise screw sense.  
</p>

<p>
It would be very interesting to 
know what breaks the symmetry of screw sense.  How is it that one green line gets
assigned to a Clockwise screw sense Tetrahelix and another gets assigned to a 
Counter Clockwise?  At this point, one line seems the same as any other line.
</p>


<p>
Note that the green lines come in crossing pairs.  There are 6 intersetion points 
which define an Octahedron.
</p>

<p>
The angle of the interseting green lines gives the angle at which the Tetrahelix intersect
ech other.
</p>


<div align="center">
 <img src="figures/TangentLines04.jpg">
</div>


<p>
However, it should be noted that the symmetry axis of two Tetrahelix which share 
the same Tetrahedron do not have to intersect inside the shared Tetrahedron.
</p>

<p>
As the following figure shows, a Tetrahelix's symmetry axis will intersect 5 other
Tetrahelix axis of symmetry and 2 of the intersection points are outside the 
Tetrahedron.
</p>


<div align="center">
 <img src="figures/NumIntersections01.jpg">
</div>

<p>
Intersection points 1 and 5 in the above figure are outside the Tetrahedron.  Points
2 and 4 are on the face of the Tetrahedron and intersection point 3 
is inside the Tetrahedron.
</p>

<p>
It has been suggested to me by Joe Matto that 2 Tetrahelix can "intersect" each other at 90 degrees.
This is not possible if by "intersect" one means that the axis of symmetry of the 
Tetrahelix intersect at 90 degrees.
</p>


<p>
However, recall that the opposite edge of a Tetrahedron pass by each other at 90 degrees.
That is, the two opposit edges share the same mid-edge point axis and one edge 
is rotated by 90 degrees about this shared axis with respect to the other edge.

<p>
In a similar way, the axis of symmetry of 2 Tetrahelix can pass by each other at 
90 degrees.  Note that the 2 Tetrahelix are also passing through the same Tetrahedron.
So, one could say that the Tetrahelix are intersecting each other at 90 degrees.
</p>

<p>
Here is a figure showing the symmetry axis lines from another point of view showing that
one passes under another and are rotated about a common axis by 90 degrees, just like
the Tetrahedron case shown above.

<p>
Here is another perspective of this in which I draw in a Tetrhaheron (in black) and
a mid-edge to mid-edge axis of the Tetrahedron (in blue).
