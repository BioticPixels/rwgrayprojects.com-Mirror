 12 Tetrahelix-Tetrahedron Intersection Points
</H1>


<p>
We calculate the (x, y, z) coordinates for the 3x4=12 points (3 per Tetrahedron 
triangular face)  for the triangle face coordinates (7, 3).  
This will allows us to then calculate other properties of the Tetrahelix.
</p>

<p>
Recall that the Tetrahelix axis passes through the (7, 3) points of the Tetrahedron's
triangular face.
</p>

<div align="center">

<p>
We position the Tetrahedron so that its 4 vertices are at
<br><br>
V1 = (1, 1, 1)
<br>
V2 = (–1, –1, 1)
<br>
V3 = (–1, 1, –1)
<br>
V4 = (1, –1, –1)
</p>


<div align="center">
 <img src="Tetra01.jpg">
</div>


<p>
The Tetrahedron edge length is then
</p>

<div align="center">

EL = dist(V2 - V1) = sqrt( (-1 - 1)^2 + (-1 - 1)^2 + (1 - 1)^2)
<br>
EL = sqrt( 4 + 4 + 0) = 2 sqrt(2) = 2.828427125...

</div>

<p>
For the V1-V2-V3 triangular face, we let
<br><br>
Va = (V2 – V1) = (–2, –2, 0)
<br>
Vb = (V3 – V2) = (0 , 2, –2) 
<br>
Vc = (V1 – V3) = (2, 0, 2)

<hr width="25%">

<p>
Now that we know the (7,3) points we can draw the small triangle red triangle
on each of the 4 Tetrahedron's faces.
</p>


<div align="center">
 <img src="Tetra02.jpg">
</div>

<p>
We know that the Tetrahelix axes make crossing lines through these (7, 3) triangle 
face points.
</p>

<p>
For eaxmple, if we look at just 2 of the red triangles then two of the Tetrahelix
axes pass through the 4 points as follows.
</p>


<div align="center">
 <img src="Tetra03.jpg">
</div>

<p>
"A" goes to "A" and "B" goes to "B".
</p>


<p>
The two "A" point coordinates are
</p>

<div align="center">
A(123) = (–0.2, 0.4, 0.4), A(134) = (0.2, 0.4, –0.4)
</div>

<p>
The length of the line segment A-to-A is given by
</p>

<div align="center">
dist = sqrt( (0.2 + 0.2)^2 + (0.4 - 0.4)^2 + (-0.4 - 0.4)^2 )
<br>
dist = sqrt(0.16 + 0.0 + 0.64) = sqrt(0.8) 
<br>
dist = sqrt(8/10) = 2 / sqrt(5) = 0.894427191...
</div>

<p>
We can calculate the crossing angle as follows:
</p>

<p>
Since the edge length of the Tetrahedron is EL = 2 sqrt(2) the edge length  of the
small red triangle is 
</p>

<div align="center">
ELs = EL / 10 = sqrt(2) / 5.
</div>

<p>
We let alpha = (1/2) crossing angle.
</p>

<div align="center">
 <img src="CrossingAngle.jpg">
</div>

<p>
Then
</p>

<div align="center">

sin(alpha) = (ELs/2) / ( (2/sqrt(5)) / 2)
<br>
sin(alpha) = ( sqrt(2) / 10 ) / ( 1 / sqrt(5) )
<br>
sin(alpha) = sqrt(5) / (5 sqrt(2) )
<br>
sin(alpha) = 1 / sqrt(10)
</div>

<p>
Then the crossing angle is
</p>

<div align="center">
 alpha = 2 arcsin(1/sqrt(10)) = 36.86989765... degrees.
</div>

<hr width="75%">







<p>
We now wish to calculate the angle which a Tetrahelix makes with a table top when 
the a Tetrahedron face is placed flat on the table.
</p>

<p>
We first need a vector which is perpendicular to a Tetrahedron face.  This can easily
be found by summing the vectors to vectices V1, V2, and V3. (The red line in the next 
figure is perpendicular to the V1,V2,V3 face of the Tetrahedron.)
</p>

<div align="center">
 <img src="p0000b.jpg">
</div>

<p>
 This is essentually 
taking the average of the 3 vectors and multiplying by 3.  Recall that the average
of the vectors is given by
</p>


<div align="center">
 Avg(123) = (1/3)(V1 + V2 + V3)
</div>

<p>
So, multiplying by 3 we get
</p>

<div align="center">
 Vn(123) = (V1 + V2 + V3) = (-1, 1, 1)
</div> 

<p>
This is a vector pointing out through the Face Center of the V1, V2, V3 face.
</p>

<p>
This vector Vn(123) is normal (perpendicular) the the V1, V2, V3 face.
</p>

<p>
If we put the Tetrahedron of the table with its V1, V2, V3 face flat on the table,
this vector will point down through the table.  So, we reverse the direction of this
vector so that it will point up from the table top.
</p>


<div align="center">
 Vn(123) = (1, -1, -1)
</div>

<p>
For calculation purposes, we make the length of this vector to be 1.  In the Figures, 
the length is not 1 and is drawn as a red line.
</p>

<div align="center">
 Vn(123) = (1/sqrt(3))(1, -1, -1) = (1/sqrt(3), -1/sqrt(3), -1/sqrt(3))
</div>


<p>
We will use the vector dot product to calculate the angles.
</p>

<div align="center">
 A.B = |A| |B| cos(theta)
<br>
 theta = arccos(A.B / (|A||B|))
</div>

<p>
The vector connecting the 2 "A" points above
</p>

<div align="center">
A(123) = (–0.2, 0.4, 0.4)
<br>
A(134) = (0.2, 0.4, –0.4)
</div>

<p>
is given by
</p>

<div align="center">
VAA = A(134) - A(123) = (0.4, 0.0, -0.8) = (2/5, 0, -4/5)
</div>

<p>
(see the blue line in the figures.)
</p>

<p>
Its magnitude is
</p>

<div align="center">
mag(VAA) = sqrt(0.4^2 + (-0.8)^2) = sqrt(0.16 + 0.64)
<br>
mag(VAA) = sqrt(0.8) = sqrt(8/10) = 2 / sqrt(5)
</div>

<p>
The unit vector in the VAA direction is then
</p>

<div align="center">
 UAA = (sqrt(5)/2)(2/5, 0, -4/5)
<br>
 UAA = (1/sqrt(5), 0, -2/sqrt(5))
</div>


<p>
Note that vectors can be moved to any position as long as we don't change their
direction nor their magnitude.  So I move it (blue line) in the Figure so that 
it is at the face center.  The red line (perpendicular line to the Tetrahedron face)
also passes through the face center point.
</p>



<div align="center">
 <img src="p0001b.jpg">
</div>



<p>
The dot product is
</p>

<div align="center">

(1/sqrt(3), -1/sqrt(3), -1/sqrt(3)).(1/sqrt(5), 0, -2/sqrt(5))
<br>

(1/sqrt(15) + 2/sqrt(15)) = 3/sqrt(15) = sqrt(3/5)
</div>

<p>
So theta is
</p>

<div align="center">
 theta = arccos(sqrt(3/5)) = 39.23152048... degrees
</div>


<p>
Which means the Tetrahelix makes an angle of 
</p>

<div align="center">
90 - arccos(sqrt(3/5)) = 50.76847952... degrees
</div>

<p>
with the table's surface.
</p>

<hr width="50%">

<p>
There is another angle at which a Tetrahelix can make with the table
when the Tetrahedron is placed flat on the table.  See the green line 
in the above figure.  This is another axis of symmetry for some Tetrahelix.
It passes through the table top some distance away from the Tetrahedron as the 
following Figures show.
</p>


<div align="center">
 <img src="p0004.jpg">
</div>

<div align="center">
 <img src="p0005.jpg">
</div>

<p>
There are several line segments we could chose for the calculation.
The following 2 Figures shows the line segement in green that I will use.
Yes, its very hard to see the orientation. 
</p>


<div align="center">
 <img src="gl03.jpg">
</div>


<p>
The two points selected are:
<br><br>
P3 = (0.4, -0.2, 0.4) from face (1.2.4), and
<br>
P2 = (0.4, 0.2, -0.4) from face (1.3.4).
</p>

<p>
The vector along this line segment is then
</p>

<div align="center">
V = (0.4, 0.2, -0.4) – (0.4, –0.2, 0.4)
<br>
V = (0.0, 0.4, -0.8) = (0, 2/5, -4/5)

</div>

<p>
As before, the magnitude of this vector is
</p>

<div align="center">
mag(V) = sqrt(0.4^2 + (-0.8)^2) = sqrt(0.16 + 0.64)
<br>
mag(V) = sqrt(0.8) = sqrt(8/10) = 2 / sqrt(5)
</div>

<p>
The unit vector in the direction of th egreen line segment is then
</p>

<div align="center">
 UV = (sqrt(5)/2)(0, 2/5, -4/5)
<br>
 UV = (0, 1/sqrt(5), -2/sqrt(5))
</div>

<p>
We can place this vector anywhere we want.  So we place it 
at the center of the 1.2.3 face.
</p>

<div align="center">
 <img src="p0002.jpg">
</div>

<p>
The dot product with the face unit normal is given by
</p>

<div align="center">
D = (1/sqrt(3), -1/sqrt(3), -1/sqrt(3)).(0, 1/sqrt(5), -2/sqrt(5))
<br>
D = 0 - 1/sqrt(15) + 2/sqrt(15)  = 1/sqrt(15) 
</div>

<p>
So, for this case, theta is
</p>

<div align="center">
 theta = arccos(sqrt(1/15)) = 75.0367825... degrees
</div>

<div align="center">
 <img src="p0003b.jpg">
</div>

<p>
Which means this Tetrahelix makes an angle of
</p>

<div align="center">
90 - arccos(sqrt(1/15)) = 14.96321744... degrees
</div>

<p>
with the table.
</p>
