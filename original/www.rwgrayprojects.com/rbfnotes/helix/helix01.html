<P>The tetrahelix of 

<a href="../../synergetics/synergetics.html">
Fuller's Synergetics 
</a>

consists of face
bond regular tetrahedra.  The mathematics for this spiraling
structure is quit interesting.  Dispite the tetrahelix being composed
of regular tetrahedra (the "simplest" polyhedron), I have not been 
able to find a simple
way to calculate the information for the tetrahelix.
</p>

<p>
From the Zheng paper (see References below): "The tetrahedral helix is also called the 'Bernal spiral' in association
with discussions of liquid structures in the physics literature."
</p>

<P>
The vertices of the regular tetrahedra of the tetrahelix all lay
on the surface of a cylinder.  Let us visualize this cylinder 
to be along the z-axis.  
</p>

<div align="center">
 <img src="cylinder01.jpg">
<br>
 <img src="cylinder02.jpg">
</div>


<p>
The radius of the cylinder will be
</p>

<div align="center">
 r = (3 sqrt(3) / 10) EL
</div>

<p>
where EL is the edge length of the tetrahedra used to build the 
tetrahelix.
</P>



<P>
Let us put a vertex (call it V0) of one of the tetrahedra on 
the x-axis.  That is
</p>

<div align="center">
 V0 = (r, 0, 0)
</div>
<p>
Then the next vertex of the tetrahelix (V1) will be at the coordinates
</p>

<div align="center">
 V1 = (r cos(theta), r sin(theta), h)
</div>

<p>
where theta is the angle around the z-axis and is given by
</p>

<div align="center">
 theta = arccos(-2/3)  (approximately 131.8103149 degrees)
</div> 

<p>
and where h is the distance in the z-axis direction and is given by
</p>

<div align="center">
 h = (1/sqrt(10)) EL
</div>


<p>
</p>

<div align="center">
 <img src="NextVertex01.jpg">
<br>
 <img src="NextVertex02.jpg">
</div>


<p>
In the above figures, the yellow band connects a vertex to the "next" vertex, while the 
distance h is the distance between the 2 blue bands around the cylinder.
</p>

<p>
In general, the coordinates for the vertices of a <b>Counter Clockwise</b> tetrahelix
 Vn (n = 0, 1, 2, 3, ...) are given by
</p>

<div align="center">
 Vn = (r cos(n*theta), r sin(n*theta), n*h)
</div>


<p>
The coordinates for the vertices of a <b>Clockwise</b> tetrahelix
 Vn (n = 0, 1, 2, 3, ...) are given by
</p>

<div align="center">
 Vn = (r cos(n*theta), - r sin(n*theta), n*h)
</div>


<P>
Note that cos(theta) = -2/3  and that sin(theta) = sqrt(5)/3.  You can 
calculate exact expressions for the vertex coordinates by using these
relations together with the following trig identities:
</p>

<div align="center">
 cos(n*theta) = cos(theta)*cos((n-1)*theta) - sin(theta)*sin((n-1)*theta)
<BR>
 sin(n*theta) = sin(theta)*cos((n-1)*theta) + cos(theta)*sin((n-1)*theta) 
</div>

<P>
One of the reasons that deriving the above information is
difficult is that the axis of symmetry of the cylinder (the axis 
through the center of the cylinder) does not pass through the 
center of volume of the tetrahedra.  The distance from the
z-axis to the tetrahedron center of volume is given by the equation
</p>

<div align="center">
 dist. = (sqrt(2)/10) EL
</div>

<p>
Therefore, all the Tetrahelix cylinder axis of symmetry pass tangentially by a sphere of 
radius (sqrt(2)/10)EL centered at the Tetrahedron's center of volume.

   Tetrahelix come in 2 orientations; a right-handed spiral and
   a left-handed spiral.

 <LI>
   The vertices of the tetrahelix never line up.  That is, no two vertices
   will ever be directly above one another.  This is because the theta angle
   above is an irrational number.  

   <div align="center">
    <img src="alignment.jpg">
   </div>

   <br>
  </li>

  <li>
   It looks like you might be able to "nest" 3 additional tetrahelix
   about the original tetrahelix in a nice tight bundle.  But this is
   not possible.  The reason is that face binding 5 tetrahedra together
   about a single edge/axis leaves a gap (which Fuller calls the 
   unzipping angle.)  The dihedral angle of the regular tetrahedron is
   <div align="center">
    D-tetra = arccos(1/3) (approximately 70.528779 degrees)
   </div>
   5 times this amount is approx 352.643895 degrees which is 
   approx 7.356105 degrees (the unzipping angle) short of 360 degrees.  So
   the tetrahedra of multiple helixes can not pack together without gaps.

   <br><br>
  </li>

  <li>
   There are 12 possible Tetrahelix passing through a single Tetrahedron: 
   6 Clockwise and 6 Counter clockwise.  
   As the figure shows, the spiral/coil associated with a Tetrahelix going through
   a Tetrahedron passes through all 4 vertices of the Tetrahedron sequentially.  Since the 
   spiral has the same symmetry axes as the Tetrahelix, we can count the number of possible
   different spirals to count the number of Tetrahelix.
   
   <div align="center">
    <img src="count01.jpg">
   </div>

   We label the Tetrahedron's vertices by numbering them 1, 2, 3, and 4.  Then
   there are 4x3x2x1 = 24 combinations for the order in which the spiral can pass through
   the vertices.  However, 1/2 of these are simply reversals: (1,2,3,4) has the same 
   spiral symmetry axis as the spiral (4,3,2,1).  That leaves 12 spirals/Tetrahelix.

   I find that there is a Clockwise and a Counterclockwise spiral associated with every 
   Tetrahelix.

   Note that the spacing between adjacent loops in the spiral is different for the CCW
   spiral versus the CW spiral.

   (My notes on this (dated 1997) suggests that I am not the originator of this.  Unfortunately,
    they do not indicate who suggested this originally.)
   <br><br>
   If the tetrahedra used to build the tetrahelix are 10-frequency (have 11 vertices per 
   edge) then the axis of the surrounding tetrahelix
   cylinder will always pass through the tetrahedra faces at an inner
   triangular face vertex.  The "triangular face coordinate" which
   the symmetry axis passes through is (7,3).

  <li>
   For a finite length Tetrahelix, all of the Tetrahelix's vertices can be given 
   rational (x, y, z) coordinates.  Then by scaling, the coordinates' x, y, z, components
   can be made to be integers.
   <br><br>

  <LI>
   I have found that if you allow the vertices to be flexible and allow some of the 
   tetrahedra egdes to expand in length, the 
   tetrahelix can fold up into another (shorter) tetrahelix.  When it does, it passes 
   through an Octahedron phase.
   <p>
    Here is a sequence of images to help visualize the transformation.
   </p>

   <p>
    First, consider the Tetrahelix to be made up of a number of  3-Tetrahedra units.  By folding up 
each of these units, the Tetrahelix is reduced.
   </p>

   <p>
    We can fold up a 3-Tetra unit as shown in the following figures.
   </p>

   <div align="center">
    <img src="Step01.jpg">
   </div> 

   <p>
    Not that only the C-to-D edge needs to change its length.  All other edges of the 
    Tetrahedra remain the same.
   </p>

   <p>
    At this point, the 3 Tetrahedra are very close to defining an Octahedron.  They actually
    do form an Octahedron as the vertices "A" and "B" are brought closer togther.
   </p>

   <p>
    When vertices "A" and "B" are brought together, a double Tetrahedron is formed.  That is
    two Tetrahedra face bound togther.  (This figure only shows one of the 2 Tetrahedra.  The
   other is hidden behind this one.)
   </P>


   <div align="center">

   <p>
    The transformation from the 3 Tetrahedra to the Octahedron Fuller calls the 
      "Richter Transformation".  See Color plate 6 in Fuller's book
     <a href="../../synergetics/synergetics.html">
     Synergetics.</a>
      I am not aware that Fuller continued the transformation described
     here to transform a Tetrahelix.

   Joe Matto suggested to me (October, 2004) that 2 Tetrahelix can intersect each other
   at 90 degrees.  If we define "intersect" to mean that the axis of symmetry of 2 
   Tetrahelix pass through a common Tetrahedron and 
   pass through a common point at 90 degrees, then this statement is not
   true.  The 2 Tetrahelix "intersect" each other at 
   <div align="center">
    2 arcsin(1/sqrt(10)) = 36.86989765... degrees.
   </div>
 
   <p>
    However, if we define "intersect" to mean that the 2 Tetrahelix pass through a
    common Tetrahedron and thier symmetry axes pass by each other at 90 degrees, then 
    this is true.
   </p>

   <p>
    See all the detail on the 
    <a href="helix02.html">
      next Tetrahelix web page.

  </li>


  <li>
   There are 2 ways to place the end of a Tetrahelix flat on the top of a table such that
   the Tetrahelix riases above the table. 

   <a href="12Points/TriangleCoord.html">
     See the calculations here.
   </a>


   The angles which the symmetry axis makes with 
   the table top are:  

    <div align="center">
      90 - arccos(sqrt(1/15)) = 14.96321744... degrees
    </div>

   and
 
   <div align="center">
    90 - arccos(sqrt(3/5)) = 50.76847952... degrees
