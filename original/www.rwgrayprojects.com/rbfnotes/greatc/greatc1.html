<BR>
<P>In Synergetics, Fuller refers to the great circles associated
with polyhedra as "railroad tracks of energy".  The great circles
are defined by spinning the polyhedron about an axis.
The spinning polyhedron's "equator" defines a great
circle. By spinning the polyhedron about all its vertex to vertex,
mid-edge to mid-edge and face-center to face-center axis you can
generate all the polyhedron's primary great circles.  Secondary
great circles are generated by using the intersection points of two
great circles as new "secondary" axis about which the polyhedron
is spun.
</P>

<P>The various intersecting great circle patterns on the spherical
suface result in the creation of many spherical triangles.  When the
Vector Equilibrium (cuboctahedron) is used as the polyhedron to be spun
a common spherical triangle (and its mirror image triangle) can be seen
to cover the entire surface of the sphere. Such a spherical triangle
(with its mirror image triangle) Fuller called an LCD (Lowest Common
Dinominator) triangle.  A diffferent LCD spherical triangle is generated
when the Icosahedron is used as the polyhedron to be spun. </P>


<P>The "Appendix of Tables" in Synergetics 2 lists all the angles
associated with LCD spherical triangles generated by the primary and
secondary great circles of the Vector Equilibrium
(the cuboctahedron), the Icosahedron and the combined VE and Icosa.
(Tables of the primary great circle angles are located
elsewhere in the Synergetics books.)  This data was originally calculated
by Christopher Kitrick and Robert Grip for R. B. Fuller.  As part of
my desire to learn Synergetics and to check that the tables did not
contain any errors/misprints, I calculated this data myself.  (I found
a couple of errors/misprints which I correct in the tables below.)
</P>

<P>Fuller made comments to the effect that all geodesic dome (angles?
chord factors?) are contained in these tables.  (Wish I had the reference
for this statement at hand.  I can't find it at the moment so don't
take this comment too seriously.)  I can see how the equations and methods
used to calculate this data (spherical trig.) is used in the same way
to calculate data for domes, but I don't see how all dome info can
be obtained for the tables.  (Probably I am just remembering the comment
incorrectly.)
</P>

<P>For those of you intersested in finding a connection with
Quantum Mechanics, I have found that <I>some</I> of the great circle
angular data corresponds to an equation in quantum mechanics.  Select
the Quantum mechanics option below for further details.

<P>By the way, while I have your attention, here is an picture I did
which explains, at lest to me, how a central angle becomes a surface
angle and a surface angle becomes a central angle.
