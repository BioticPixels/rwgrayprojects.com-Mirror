<BR>

<P>But the <I>big</I> question I have with respect to the great circles
is "Is there any physics in this?
Is there any physical system (atoms, nucleus, etc.) whose behavior or
properties can be explained by energy in motion along great circle
energy railroad tracks?"  I have been able to identify most of the VE's
primary LCD spherical triangle great circle angles with an equation
from quantum mechanics which gives the angle between a particle's
angular momentum vector and a "precession" axis. (This "precession" axis
is defined as some prefered direction in space about which, in the q.m.
model, the angular momentum vector is precessing.  Note that in quantum
mechanics this is only given as a model.  It is not necassarily
what is <I>really</I> happening.)  For example, the "precession" axis
may be defined as the direction of an imposed magnetic field.
But the association is not complete and I don't (yet) see how this
helps explain the quantization of angular momentum in quantum mechanics.
I'll give this association in the tables.
</P>

<P>In quantum mechanics the magnitude of the projection of the angular
momentum vector onto the "precession" axis is quantized and is given by
the equation
<BR>
sqrt(J(J+1)) cos(a) = mj
<BR>
where sqrt(J(J+1)) is the magnitude of the angular momentum and
mj is the magnitude of the projection of angular momentum
onto the "precession" axis. "a" is the angle between them.  So,
<BR>
a = arccos( mj / sqrt(J(J+1)) )
<BR>
"arccos" is the inverse of the cos function. I'll write this as "acos".
It is found that mj and J can only be integers or half-integers.
Specifically:
<BR>
J = 0, 1/2, 1, 3/2, 2, ...
<BR>
then, for whatever value J has, mj is restricted to
<BR>
 -J, -(J-1), -(J-2), ..., 0 or 1/2, ...,(J-2), (J-1), J
<BR>
In the tables I give the mj and J values which correspond
to the LCD triangle great circle angular data (all in degrees).  In
some of the entries, an angle like 90 or 180 degrees needs to be
added or subtracted in order for the quantum mechanical angle to
match the great circle angle. As an example I use the notation
<BR>
 90 - acos(7,8)
<BR>
for the angle given by 90 - arccos( 7 / sqrt(8(8-1)) ).
</P>
<P>In the tables, "asin" is the inverse of the trig sine function.
