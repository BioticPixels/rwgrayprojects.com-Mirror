<H1 ALIGN="center">Intro to Spherical Trig.</H1>
<P>
  I used spherical trigonometry to calculate all the angles for 
the 48 and the 120 LCD spherical triangles of the vector equilibrium and the 
icosahedron generated by the primary great circles.  The presentation given 
here is far from complete and provides no proofs of the relations stated.
<P>
The only text book on spherical trigonometry which I have been able to locate 
is Plane And Spherical Trigonometry, by Kells, Kern, and Bland, McGraw-Hill 
Book Co., 1940.  Other sources to consult are mathematics encyclopedia and 
dictionaries.
<P>
A spherical triangle is defined when three planes pass through the surface of a
sphere and through the sphere's center of volume. 
<P>

</P>
A spherical
triangle has three surface angles and three central angles.  In the figure, 
'A', 'B', and 'C' label the surface angles while 'a', 'b', and 'c' 
label the central angles.  The surface angles correspond to the angle at which 
two planes intersect each other.  Note that the arcs are labeled by the central
angles.  In particular, notice that the arc opposite a surface angle is labeled
with the surface angle's LOWER case letter.  For example, the arc opposite the 
surface angle 'A' is labeled by the lower case letter 'a'.  This is just 
notation and need not be followed, but it helps in remembering the relations to
follow.
<P>
As with plane trigonometry, it is usually easiest to work with a right 
spherical triangle.  That is, a spherical triangle which has a
 <IMG BORDER=0 ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="" SRC="img1.gif"> 
surface angle.  I will label this 
<IMG BORDER=0 ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="" SRC="img2.gif"> surface angle with the capital 
letter 'C'.  This means that the planes which define angle 'C' intersect each
other at <IMG BORDER=0 ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="" SRC="img3.gif">.
<P>
It may be necessary to either extend a spherical triangle or divide a spherical
triangle into two triangles in order to obtain a <IMG BORDER=0 ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="" SRC="img4.gif"> spherical 
triangle.  See below.  This is often done in plane trigonometry.
<P>
Let B be an angle.  We define the complement angle <IMG BORDER=0 ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="" SRC="img5.gif"> to be <IMG BORDER=0 ALIGN=MIDDLE ALT="" SRC="img6.gif">.  Then from the trigonometric relations given in 
Plane Trig, we have
<P>
<IMG BORDER=0 ALIGN=MIDDLE ALT="" SRC="img7.gif">
<P>
<IMG BORDER=0 ALIGN=MIDDLE ALT="" SRC="img8.gif">
<P>
<IMG BORDER=0 ALIGN=MIDDLE ALT="" SRC="img9.gif">
<P>
<IMG BORDER=0 ALIGN=MIDDLE ALT="" SRC="img10.gif">
<P>
Note that in paragraph 1050.40 of Synergetics, the complement angle, identified
by a small superscript 'c', is incorrectly identified as being <IMG BORDER=0 ALIGN=MIDDLE ALT="" SRC="img11.gif">.  The angle <IMG BORDER=0 ALIGN=MIDDLE ALT="" SRC="img12.gif"> is known as the supplemental angle.
<P>
Napier's Rules for a spherical right triangle may be stated as:
<P>
1. The sine of an angle is equal to the product of cosines of the opposite two 
angles.
<P>
2. The sine of an angle is equal to the product of tangents of the two adjacent
angles.
<P>
There is an easy way to determine which angles are the opposite and which 
angles are the adjacent angles.  Consider the spherical right triangle   
in which the surface angle <b>C</b> is 
<IMG BORDER=0 ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="" SRC="img13.gif">.  We may write the 5 
other angles (the <IMG BORDER=0 ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="" SRC="img14.gif"> 
surface angle is omitted) into a circle which has
been divided into 5 ''pieces of pie''. 
<P>
<IMG BORDER=0 ALIGN=MIDDLE ALT="" SRC="images/strig2.gif">
<P>
 For example, starting with the angle <b>b</b>
and moving in a counter clockwise direction around the spherical triangle, the 
angles <b>b</b>, <b>a</b>, <b>B</b>, <b>c</b>, and <b>A</b>
 are enter into the circle also in a counter 
clockwise direction.  We must now take the complement of all the angles which 
are NOT connected to the <IMG BORDER=0 ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="" SRC="img15.gif">
 surface angle <b>C</b>.  These angles are <b>B</b>, 
<b>c</b>, and A and are the angles connected to the hypotenuse.  So, a bar is 
written over these three angles in the circle to give us
 <IMG BORDER=0 ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="" SRC="img16.gif">,
 <IMG BORDER=0 ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="" SRC="img17.gif">, 
and <IMG BORDER=0 ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="" SRC="img18.gif">. 
 It is now easy to see which angles are opposite and which angles
are adjacent.  For example, pick angle <b>a</b>.  The Napier circle shows that 
the two opposite angles are <IMG BORDER=0 ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="" SRC="img19.gif">
 and <IMG BORDER=0 ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="" SRC="img20.gif"> while the two adjacent angles
are <b>b</b> and <IMG BORDER=0 ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="" SRC="img21.gif">.  Therefore, from Napier's Rule #1 (and the above 
relations for complimentary angles), we have
<P>
<IMG BORDER=0 ALIGN=MIDDLE ALT="" SRC="img22.gif">
<P>
and from Napier's Rule #2, we have
<P>
<IMG BORDER=0 ALIGN=MIDDLE ALT="" SRC="img23.gif">
<P>
The following relations hold for spherical triangles other than just the 
spherical right triangle.
<P>
The Law of Cosines (central angles):
<P>
1. cos(a) = cos(b)cos(c) + sin(b)sin(c)cos(A)
<P>
2. cos(b) = cos(a)cos(c) + sin(a)sin(c)cos(B)
<P>
3. cos(c) = cos(a)cos(b) + sin(a)sin(b)cos(C)
<P>
The Law of Cosines (surface angles):
<P>
1. cos (A) = - cos(B)cos(C) + sin(B)sin(C)cos(a)
<P>
2. cos (B) = - cos(A)cos(C) + sin(A)sin(C)cos(b)
<P>
3. cos (C) = - cos(A)cos(B) + sin(A)sin(B)cos(c)
<P>
The Law of Sines:
<P>
<IMG BORDER=0 ALIGN=MIDDLE ALT="" SRC="img24.gif">
<P>
If we know the angles a, A, and b, then we can solve for the angle B by the
Law of Sines
<P>
<IMG BORDER=0 ALIGN=MIDDLE ALT="" SRC="img25.gif">
<P>
It is possible when using the Law of Sines to obtain no solution, one solution,
or two solutions.  In the above example, if
 <IMG BORDER=0 ALIGN=MIDDLE ALT="" SRC="img26.gif">, 
then the Law of Sines gives no information about angle B since the sine
of an angle is always less than or equal to one.  We must also remember that 
<IMG BORDER=0 ALIGN=MIDDLE ALT="" SRC="img27.gif">
 and so we must consider not only the angle 
B but also its supplement <IMG BORDER=0 ALIGN=MIDDLE ALT="" SRC="img28.gif">.  
So there are two possible 
solutions, <b>B</b> and <IMG BORDER=0 ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="" SRC="img29.gif">.  
One of the solutions can be discarded if we know some
other constraint on the angle <b>B</b>.  For example, if we know that
 <IMG BORDER=0 ALIGN=MIDDLE ALT="" SRC="img30.gif"> and the Law of Sines gives us
 <IMG BORDER=0 ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="" SRC="img31.gif"> and 
<IMG BORDER=0 ALIGN=MIDDLE ALT="" SRC="img32.gif">, we
 can discard the <IMG BORDER=0 ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="" SRC="img33.gif"> solution.
<P>
Although there are other relations which could be stated, these are the only 
ones which I have needed in order to calculate the spherical triangle data in 
the Synergetics books.
<P>
There are many methods for obtaining the solution to a spherical trigonometry 
problem as well as many other details which you will find in a spherical 
trigonometry text book.
