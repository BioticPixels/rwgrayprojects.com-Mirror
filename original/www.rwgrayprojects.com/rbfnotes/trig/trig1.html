<P>I think its worth while to give a very brief review of
the trigonometric functions sine, cosine, etc. as well as
a brief intro to calculating angles using spherical trig.
Even if you know plane trig you should look at those web pages.
I include a table of exact expressions for some standard angles.

<P>If you are at all interested in calculating the angles involved
in geodesic domes, you will be interested in the section on spherical
trig.  I give some explanation on how to use the "standard"
spherical trig formulas. (These days there are computer programs for
calculating all the data for geodesic domes so that it is not critical that
you understand spherical trig. for building domes.) Also, these
equations are the basis for calculating the great circle arc data
for the VE and icosahedron LCD spherical triangles.
