<font size="+1">

<P>
The general overview of the algorithm I use is:

<P>
First... 
<ol>
 <li>Understand layout of Icosahedron on sphere.
 <li>Understand layout of map in plane.
 <li>Define a "standard" spherical triangle into which all sphere points 
     will get mapped to.
 <li>Define a standard plane equilateral triangle into which all the standard 
     spherical triangle points will get mapped to.
</ol>
</p>

<P>
Then...
<ol>
 <li>Select a point P=(long. lat.) to be mapped to (x, y).
 <li>Determine which of the 20 Icosahedron spherical triangles the point P1 falls within.
 <li>Change the point's P1 coordinates to a corresponding point P2 in the 
     "standard" spherical triangle.
 <li>Determine the arc *distances* d1, d2, d3 along the three sides of the 
     "standard" spherical
     triangle which uniquely identifies the location of the point P2. 
 <li>Use these same *distances* d1, d2, d3, along the flat edges of the 
     standard *plane* equilateral triangle to define (at most) a small plane 
     triangle. This small plane triangle will have (at most) 3 vertices V1, V2, V3.  
 <li>Calculate the 
     average of (at most) V1, V2, V3 to get the point P3.
 <li>Translate and rotate the point P3 onto the plane map.  This depends on which 
     Icosahedron spherical triangle the original point P1 was in.        
</ol>

<P>
We want to map any (longitude, latitude) coordinate of the World sphere to an 
(x, y) coordinate on the plane map.
</p>
<P>
We must first understand that the sphere is divided into 20 spherical triangles. 
This is "simply" the Icosahedron projected onto the world sphere.  Fuller 
positioned the Icosahedron in a special way.  
<a href=graymap4.html>(See this web page for a
table of coordinates for the Icosahedron's 12 vertices.)</a>    
</P>

<P>
Because each of the 20 spherical triangles are the same shape and size, we only
need to understnad how to transform an arbitrary point within a single triangle 
from (longitude, latitude) to (x, y).
</P>

<P>
So, the first step of the algorithm is to determine and remember which of the 
20 spherical triangles the point is within.
</P>

<p>
This is accomplished by using the table of the 12 vertex coordinates and
calculating the distance from the selected point P=(longitude, latitude)
to each vertex.
