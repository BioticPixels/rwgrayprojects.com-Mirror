<BR>
<P>Below is a table I composed for the positioning of the icosahedron
as used to create Fuller's icosahedron based world map.  These coordinates
are very slightly modified to those I first saw in an IBM Technical Report
by Mr. Scott.  The modifications mentioned here were to make the distances
between connected vertices all the same.  The coordinates I saw in the IBM
TR were off ever so slightly and may have been due to rounding of the numbers.
You will also have to adjust the coordinates listed below if you wish to
use them and you need them to be more accurate than I list here.  A year or so
later, I saw some notes by Chris Kitrick at the BFI which also had the coordinates
for the 12 vertices.  I do not know what coordinates Bucky Fuller really used,
nor the coordinates which Shoji Sadao used, but they must be very close to those
I list below.</P>
