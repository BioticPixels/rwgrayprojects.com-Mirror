<P>Below, you will be able to obtain a C language program I wrote
which  converts (longitude, latitude) coordinates into (x, y)
coordinates for Fuller's icosahedron based world map.  There are two
programs to download.  The first file is a short "driver" program which
interfaces with the user and  calls the conversion program.  This will
give you an example of how to call  the conversion routines should you
wish to write your own driver program. The second file contains the
conversion routines.  Not included is the C language project (.prj) file
which, if you know C, is just a file containing  the name of the other
two files.</P>
<P>I do not claim that these programs are coded in the most efficient
way, nor even that they are very well organized, but they should work.
</P>
<P> Each C language compiler is slightly different, so you may have to
modify  the code slightly to get it to work on your system.  </P>
<P>To "download" simply open the file by clicking on the option
below and then save the file to your disk by clicking on the
"save" or "save as" option provided by the web browser you are
using to view this page.  (Some web browsers have the "save" option
under the "File" option.  So you'll have to click on "File" and
then on "Save as".)</P>

The transformation procedure uses the following plane 
equilateral triangle
number assignment (shown in circles) and vertex number 
assignment.  Note that
triangles 9 and 16 are divided and so occur in two different
locations.
</P>
<IMG SRC="images/outline1.gif" ALIGN="MIDDLE">
<P>
The edge length of the equilateral triangles is 1, from 
which the (x, y) coordinates for each of the 26 vertices 
can be calculated.
</P>

<P>
The LCD triangles (6 for each equilateral triangle) are labeled
as shown in the next illustration.

<P>If you are interested in some of the details involved in the
transformation you can check out the other web pages I have
written.  Or you can get a copy of my paper "Fuller's Dymaxion(TM)
Map" in the journal Cartography and Geographic Information Systems,
Vol. 21, No. 4, 1994, pp. 243-246. Although  this paper does not contain the
exact transformation equations I used in the above program it does describe
the transformation in general.  The exact transformation equations are
described in my paper "Exact Transformation Equations for Fuller's World
Map."  This paper will be published sometime in the near future.  You can
also contact me directly by e-mail for further details.
