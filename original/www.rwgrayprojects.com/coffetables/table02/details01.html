 <h1 align="center">Coffee Table #2</h1>

<p>
The second coffee table is to have an Icosahedron outer shape and a regular Dodecahedron
within.  Here are some illustrations.  The Icosahedron is shown with blue struts 
and  golden/orange spherical vertices/hubs.  The regular Dodecahedron
 is shown with red struts and 
small golden/orange spherical vertices/hubs.  Very thin green struts join the outer
 Icosahedron 
to the inner Dodecahedron.

<h2 align="center">Basic Geometry Information</h2>


<p>
An Icosahedron has 12 vertices, 20 triangular faces and 30 edges/struts. There are 5 struts
converging at each hub.

<p>
A regular Dodecahedron has 20 vertices, 12 pentagon faces and 30 edges/struts.  There are 
3 struts converging at each hub.
</p>

<p>
If you extend the edges/struts of the Dodecahedron beyond the Dodecahedron's vertices, you
find that they merge in 20 groups of 3.  These in new merged/intersection points define
the vertices of an Icosahedron.

<H2 align="center">Construction Details</H2>

<h3><u>Size</u></h3>

<p>
Height (without glass): 16.0 inches = 15 inches Icosahedron + 2x0.5 inches radius of hubs.
<br>
Glass thickness: 0.25 inches.
<br>
Total Height (including glass top): 16.25 inches.
</p>

<p>
The Icosahedrons hubs are to be made out of 1 inch diameter spherical wooden spheres.
</p>
<p>
The Dodecahedron's hubs are to be made out of 0.5 inch diameter spherical wooden spheres.
</p>


<hr>

<p>
Icosahedron Struts (need 30): 0.5 inches diameter.
<br>
Vertex to Vertex length (i.e., center of hub to center of hub): 9.924 inches.
<br>

</p>

<div align="center">
 <img src="dim01.jpg">
</div>


<hr>

<br>
Dodecahedron Struts (need 30): 0.125 inches diameter.
<br>
Vertex to Vertex length: 3.791 inches.
<br>


</p>

<hr>

<p>
InterPolyhedron Struts (need 60): 0.125 inches diameter.
<br>
Vertex to Vertex length: 6.133 inches.
<br>
(NOTE: These struts are to be cut “in place” and not pre-cut. This is because 
accumulation of error and other factors introduce unpredictable 
inaccuracies.  These struts are surface glued to the polyhedra hubs, i.e. not 
recessed into the hubs.)

<p>
The Dodecahedron's hubs are designed as follows.

<table border="1" align="center">
 <tr>
  <td>

 <tr>
