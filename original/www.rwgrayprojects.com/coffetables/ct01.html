<p>
I am in the process of designing and building several coffee tables based on 
basic polyhedra relationships.  Hope you find these of interest.

 <TD><IMG SRC="table01/tablethumb.jpg"></TD>
 <TD>
  <font size="+1">
   <A HREF="table01/details01.html"><B>Coffee Table #1</B></A>
    - This is the first in a pair of coffee tables I am designing.  I give several 
    images as well as all construction details on this web page.
  </font>

<tr><td><br></td></tr>

<TR>
  <TD><IMG SRC="table02/tablethumb.jpg"></TD>
  <TD>
   <font size="+1">
    <A HREF="table02/details01.html"><b>Coffee Table #2</b></A>
      - This is the 2nd coffee table. It is designed to be a complement to Coffee Table #1.  
      These two coffee tables could be used together to form an elongated coffee table.
