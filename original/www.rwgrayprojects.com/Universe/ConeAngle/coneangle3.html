<p>
It is interesting that these 2 cone angles occur in the same geometry, having the same 
cone vertex point, and are limits (min and max) of the Jitterbug dynamics.
</p>
<p>
Here we have both tetrahedra rotating together.

<p>
We now need to know a little bit more about FCC lattices.
</p>

<p>
Note that an orientation axis system (x-, y-, z-axis) can be defined for the 
Face Centered Cubic (FCC) lattice (the lattice of closest packing of spheres) 
such that all the vertices can be given integer valued (x, y, z) coordinates.
</p>


<p>
Further, the axes can be so oriented that the "logical even/odd sum" of 
the x, y, z coordinates is always even (or alternatively always odd, see below).  
The even/odd summation operation
is summarized in the following 
table ("e"=even, "o"=odd):
</p>

<table align="center" border="1">
 <tr>
  <td>
   (x, y, z)
  </td>
  <td align="center">
    Logical Sum <br>Even/Odd
  </td>
 </tr>

 <tr>
   <td>
    (e, e, e)
   </td>
   <td align="center">
     even
   </td>
 </tr>

 <tr>
   <td>
    (e, e, o)
   </td>
   <td align="center">
     odd
   </td>
 </tr>

 <tr>
   <td>
    (e, o, e)
   </td>
   <td align="center">
     odd
   </td>
 </tr>

 <tr>
   <td>
    (e, o, o)
   </td>
   <td align="center">
     even
   </td>
 </tr>

 <tr>
   <td>
    (o, e, e)
   </td>
   <td align="center">
     odd
   </td>
 </tr> 

 <tr>
   <td>
    (o, e, o)
   </td>
   <td align="center">
     even
   </td>
 </tr>

 <tr>
   <td>
    (o, o, e)
   </td>
   <td align="center">
     even
   </td>
 </tr>

 <tr>
   <td>
    (o, o, o)
   </td>
   <td align="center">
     odd
   </td>
 </tr>

</table>

<p>
The FCC lattice for which all the vertex corrdinates are 
"logically summed" even includes the coordinate (0, 0, 0).  That is,
a lattice vertex will be located at (0, 0, 0).
</p>

<p>
An example of this is the yellow lattice shown previously. The Cuboctahedron
(VE) was taken as a small part of the FCC lattice.  
Note that it has a vertex at its center of volume.  
We used this center of volume
vertex (corrdinate (0,0,0)) as the apex point of the cones.

<p>
Another FCC lattice can be defined in which the vertex coordinates (x, y, z)
are all integers and "logically summed" odd.  For this (pink) "odd" FCC lattice, 
there is no vertex at the coordinate origin (0,0,0).  Note that in this
case, the coordinate origin (0,0,0) occurs at the center of volume of 
an Octahedron.

<p>
The Jitterbug motion occures between these two "even" (yellow) and "odd" (pink) FCC lattices.

<p>
In the Electrodynamic theory of Myron Evans, 
as used by Tom Bearden to explain how his group's Motionless
Electrical Generator (MEG) device can produce more energy out than is put in, it is shown that
the applied voltage induces a dipole moment in the material.  The dipoles act as gates allowing
energy to flow into the device.
</p>

<p>
Could it be that Universe consists of 2 different spaces, represented here as 2 different FCC
lattices?  Could it be that the induced dipoles allows the energy of one space to be transduced
into energy in the other space?  Is the Jitterbug the dynamics which allows this to happen?
</p>

<p>
Perhaps these 2 lattices are the space and anti-space of particle physics.  Particles consist
of some dynamic system of the yellow lattice while antiparticles are the same dynamic system 
only of the pink lattice.

<p>
The Quantum Mechanical angular momentum, space quantization is described
in any introductory Modern Physics or 
Introduction to Quantum Mechanics text.  For example:
</p>

  Harcourt Pub., August  1996
 </li>
 <li>
S. B. Palmer, Quantum Physics,  
Gordon and Breach Science Publishers, May 1999
 </li>
</ul>

<p>
And many others....
</p>

<p>
For Ampere's force equation between 2 Ampere current elements see
</p>
<ul>
<li>
 Peter Graneau, Neal Graneau, Newtonian Electrodynamics,
World Scientific Pub Co, June 1996 
</li>
<li>
 Peter Graneau, Ampere-Neumann Electrodynamics of Metals, 2nd edition,
(Hadronic Press Monographs in Theoretical Physics), Hadronic Press, August 1994 
</li>
<li>
 Peter Graneau, Newton Versus Einstein,
Carlton Press, December 1992 
</li>
</ul>

<p>
These references also describe why an Amperian current element is not to be considered 
to be the same as electron drift currents.
</p>

<p>
These authors also point out that the Ampere force equation was not liked by some 
researchers of that time because there was no reason for the seemingly arbitrary angular
arrangement resulting in a zero radial force.  This is the 35.264389...&deg;
angle illustrated
above.  I wonder why researchers of that time complained about this angle but not
the corresponding zero force angle in the dipole force equation.
</p>

<p>
For the dipole force equation, see any of the "standard" Electrodynamic texts.  For
example:
</p>

<ul>
<li>
John David Jackson, Classical Electrodynamics, 3rd edition,
John Wiley & Sons, August 1998 
</li>

<li>
David J. Griffiths, Introduction to Electrodynamics, 3rd Edition,
Prentice Hall, December 30, 1998 
</li>

</ul>

<p>
Curiously, and as the Graneau references point out, 
Ampere's force equation is
not to be found in these or other "standard" Electrodynamic texts, yet
Ampere's force equation is known to be experimentaly valid.
