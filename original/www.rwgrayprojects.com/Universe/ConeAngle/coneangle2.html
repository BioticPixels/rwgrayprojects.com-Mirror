Consider now one of the regular Tetrahedra within the (yellow) FCC lattice.

The top triangle of this (blue) Tetrahedron is the same size as the triangular faces 
of the Octahedron Jitterbug (red).
</p>

<p>
The Jitterbug opens until these (red and blue) triangle faces match. (This was how we defined the size
of the Jitterbug initially, above, so no surprise.)

Spinning the (blue) Tetrahedron defines another cone.

<p>
The cone angle is the same as the cone of equilibrium (force equal zero) between 2 Amperian current elements for 
the special case that the 2 current elements always point in the same direction.
</p>

<p>
The cone angle is exactly arccos(sqrt(2/3)) = 35.264389... degrees.
</p>

<p>
Consider the following figure showing 2 Amperian current elements.
</p>

<div align="center">
 <img src="ace01.jpg">
</div>

<p>
In this case, when the 2 Amperian Current Elements (ACE) are side-by-side and pointing in the 
same direction, the orange/light brown ACE will experience an attractive force
toward the light blue ACE, as indicated by the dark blue arrow/cone.  
</p>

<p>
As the orange/light brown ACE is moved around the light blue ACE, along the 
red circle, there will be regoins for which the force will be repulsive (indicated by
a red arrow/cone).
</p>
 
<div align="center">
 <img src="ace02.jpg">
</div>

<p>
The light yellow lines indicates where the <b>radial</b> component of the force is zero, and divides the attractive
force regions from the repulsive force regions. (Again, only the radial component
of the complete force is being considered here.  There are also torque forces
on the 2 ACEs which are not considered here making this an artificial arrangement.)
</p>

<p>
Here is the complete force cycle for 2 Amperian current elements (which are constrained to
point in the same direction).

<p>
Note that these 2 light yellow lines of zero radial force (equilibrium lines) make an
angle of exactly arccos(sqrt(2/3)) = 35.264389... degrees with respect to the z-axis.
</p>

<p>
If we now rotate these light yellow equilibrium lines around the z-axis, we define 2 
cones of equilibrium (cones of zero radial force).

This is the same cone as that generated by the blue regular Tetrahedron 
of the VE mentioned above (and, of course, of the Tetrahedra in the FCC lattice).
</p>

<p>
The equation for the radial component of the force between 2 Amperian
current elements is given by
</P>

<div align="center">
 <img src="equation1.gif">
</div>

<p>
Note that this is refered to as "Ampere's force law" and should not
be confused with "Ampere's Law" which is one of Maxwell's equations.
</p>

<p>
As before, epsilon is the angle between the 2 dipole's directions.  For the case
that the 2 dipoles are pointing in the same direction, epsilon=0&deg;.  Alpha and
beta are the angles between the dipole direction and the line connecting the
2 dipoles together.  In this case the 2 dipoles are pointing in the
same direction so we have alpha=beta.  The angular factor of the force 
equation is then 
</p>

<div align="center">
 ( 2 cos(0) - 3 cos(alpha) cos(alpha) )
</div>

<p>
This factor is zero, and hence the radial force is zero, when 
</p>

<div align="center">
 3 cos<sup>2</sup>(alpha) = 2
<br>
cos(alpha) = sqrt(2/3)
</div> 

<p>
Which gives alpha = 35.264389...&deg;, the same geometric cone angle mentioned above.

<p>
Here we have one Quantum Mechanical phenomenon (Angular Momentum Quantization) and 
two different classical electrodynamic phenomena: 
<ol>
 <li>dipole interactions, 
 <li>Amperian current element interactions,
</ol>
which seem to exhibit a geometric coordination under certain constraints 
(direction of orientation).
</p>


<p>
Also note that 
</p>

<div align="center">
arccos(sqrt(2/3)) + arccos(1/sqrt(3)) = 90.0&deg;
<br>
35.26438...&deg; + 54.73561...&deg; = 90.0&deg;
