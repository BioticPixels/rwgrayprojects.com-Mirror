Here is an example of a FCC (Face Centered Cubic) lattice.

Within this lattice we place a Jitterbug such that when fully opened 
it matches the vertices of the FCC lattice.

<p>
When closed, the Jitterbug (red) is in the shape of an Octahedron.  When fully
opened, the Jitterbug is in the shape of a cuboctahedron (a.k.a. Vector 
Equilibrium or just VE).
</p>

<p>
The Octahedron, having 8 triangular faces, may be divided into 8 irregular Tetrahedra.  
("Irregular" here means that not all of the edges of the Tetrahedron
are the same length.)  These 8 irregular Tetrahedron
are each defined by 3 vertices of the Octahedron plus the
center of volume point.  This defines the 4 vertices of the 1/8th Octahedra. 
One of these 1/8th of an Octahedron is shown in light blue below.

The rotation of this 1/8th Octahedron (an irregular Tetrahedron) defines a cone.

<p>
The cone angle is arccos(1/sqrt(3)) = 54.73561... degrees.  (Some people
may choose to call this the half-cone angle.  It is the angle between the
rotational symmetry axis (white line) and the surface of the cone.)
</p>

<p>
It is exactly the same angle as the precessional angle from Quantum Mechanics for a 
spin 1/2 particle in a magnetic field.
</p>

<p>
Here is a classical interpretation of the Quantum Mechanical, Spin Angular Momentum, 
Space Quantization, for a spin 1/2 particles (electron, proton) in a uniform magnetic field.

<p>
The applied magnetic field is along the z-axis (white line).  The blue and green lines are the
x and y  axes.  The red line is the spin angular momentum vector of the (pink/purple) particle.
It makes an angle of arccos(1/sqrt(3)) = 54.73561... degrees with respect to the z-axis.
</p>

<p>
The equation for this angle from Quantum Mechanics is
</p>

<div align=center>

</div>

<p>
For a spin-1/2 particle, j = 1/2, m<sub>j</sub> = (+-)1/2.  This gives
</p>


<div align="center">
cos(theta) = (1/2) / sqrt( (1/2)(1/2 + 2/2) )
<br>
cos(theta) = (1/2) / sqrt( (1/2)(3/2) ) 
<br>
cos(theta) = (1/2) / [ (1/2) sqrt(3) ]
<br>
cos(theta) = 1 / sqrt(3)
</div>

<p>
which shows that theta=54.73561...&deg; and is the same geometric cone
angle shown above.
</p>

<br><br>

<hr align="center" width="50%">

<br>
<br>

<p>
This is also the cone angle for the cone of (force) equilibrium between 2 dipoles for 
the special case that the 2 dipoles always point in the same direction.
</p>


<p>
Consider 2 dipoles (magnets with North and South poles).  These may be positioned
so that one is at the coordinate origin while the other is some distance away on the
y-axis.
</p>


<div align="center">
  <img src="dp01.jpg">
</div>


<p>
In the above figure, the z-axis is white running from top to bottom of the figure. The y-axis is green running
from left to right of the figure.  The x-axis is dark blue and is running out of the page.
</p>

<p>
A dipole (light blue) is at the coordinate origin.  Another dipole (orange/light brown) 
is positioned some distance along the y-axis.
</p>

<p>
The force experienced by the orange/light brown dipole is represented by the red arrow/cone
and by the red line of force connecting the two dipoles.  
The red arrow/cone is pointing away from the
light blue dipole meaning that the orange/light brown dipole experiences
a repulsive radial force in this position.
</p>

<p>
If we advance the orange/light brown dipole around the light blue dipole, along the 
red circle, then there is a region for which the force experienced by the 
orange/light brown dipole will be attractive, toward the light blue dipole.
This is represented by a dark blue arrow/cone at the end of the red line of force.
</p>


<div align="center">
  <img src="dp02.jpg">
</div>

<p>
There is also drawn in these figures 2 lines of equilibrium (light yellow) which
indicates where along the red circle the orange/light brown dipole will experience 
<b>no radial force</b> toward or away from the light blue dipole.

</table>

<p>
Two things to note: 1) The dipoles always point in the same direction 
(in the z-axis direction), and 2) In addition to the radial force being described
here, the dipoles will experience a torque. This torque is not considered in these 
situations.  Only the radial force between the 2 dipoles is being considered.
</p>


<p>
Here is the complete radial force cycle of the orange/light brown dipole around the center,
light blue dipole.

<p>
The light yellow lines make an angle of 
arccos(1/sqrt(3)) = 54.73561... degrees with respect to the z-axis.
</p>

<p>
If these light yellow lines are spun around the z-axis (see below for example) they would define
2 cones, one above the xy-plane and one below the xy-plane.  The cone above the xy-plane is 
the same cone as illustrated above for the 1/8th Octahedron 
(the irregular Tetrahedron). 
</p>

<p>
The equation for the radial component of the force between 2 dipoles is 
given by the equation
</p>

<div align="center">
 <img src="equation2.gif">
</div>

<p>
where epsilon is the angle between the direction that dipole 1 is pointing in
and the direction that dipole 2 is pointing in.  Alpha is the angle between 
dipole 1 direction and the line connecting dipole 1 to dipole 2.  Beta is
the angle between dipole 2 direction and the line connecting dipole 1 to dipole 2.
</p>

<p>
For the special (artificial?) case of dipole 1 pointing in the same direction
as dipole 2, we have 
</p>

<div align="center">
epsilon = 0 degrees
<br>
alpha = beta
</div>

<p>
This reduces the angular factor in the force equation to
</p>

<div align="center">
 (cos(0) - 3 cos(alpha)cos(alpha))
</div>

<p>
The radial force on these dipoles is then zero when this angular factor is zero.  This is the case when
</p>

<div align="center">
 3 cos<sup>2</sup>(alpha) = cos(0) = 1
<br>
 cos(alpha) = sqrt(1/3)
</div>

<p>
Which means alpha = 54.73561...&deg;, the same geometric angle illustrated above.
