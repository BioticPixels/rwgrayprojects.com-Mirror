<P>
Here I try to present one way of thinking about the Dirac String Trick.  This way 
of thinking about the motion makes it easy to program.
</P>

<p>
The Dirac String Trick motion always for the rotation of a central ball (which has
outward radial strings attached to its surface) such that the strings do not 
get twisted or tangled up.  After 2 rotations about the axis of rotation the strings 
return to their orignial positions, again, without any twists.
</p>

<p>
It has been suggested that this motion may have something to do with the
spin of a particle (like the electron or proton).   See for example the 
paper "Geometric Model for Fundamental Particles" 
by <a href="Batty-Pratt.pdf">Batty-Pratt and Racey</a>, International Journal of
Theoretical Physics, Vol. 19, No. 6, 1980.
</p>

<p>
See also my other web pages on this subject at 
<a href="../../WSM/SphericalRotations/SR.html">Spherical Rotations</a>
</p>

<p>
Here is a simple animation of the motion.
</p>

<p>
There are two small dots (spheres), one red and one white, which follow different strings (orange) 
around the center sphere.
</p>

</p>
Note that while the white sphere goes around only once, the red sphere goes around twice.
This illustrates that the central sphere is rotating twice to return the strings to their 
initial positions.
</p>


<p>
The way I like to think of this motion is to image concentric cones (or funnels), each with a
slightly different pitch (some almost closed, others, more open, some almost flat, etc.)
</p>

<p align="center">

 <img src="p0001.jpg">
</p>


<p>
At any one point in time, a string is confined to the surface of <i><b>a cone</i></b>.  The string 
is wrapped around the cone's surface, completing 180&deg; roatation around the cone from the rim of the
cone inward to the surface of the sphere.
</p>

<p>
In the next increament of time, the concentric layers of cones rotate (about the axis of rotation
of the sphere).  All the starting points of the strings are now on the rims of different
cones.  A sting is confined to the new cone's surface and complete 180&deg; wrapping 
around the cone.
</p>

<p>
As this structure of cones rotates around, the strings appear to do a complicated motion.
But it is a simple motion of wrapping themselfs around the surface of the cone which has its
rim at the sting's starting point.
</p>

<p>
The next Figure shows the cones rotated slightly.
</p>

<p align="center">
 <img src="p0002.jpg">
</p>

<p>
And here, the cones have rotated so that the first cone's rim is at the
starting point of the string.  Note how the string (orange) is confined to 
the blue cone's surface as it wraps around the string.
</p>

<p align="center">
 <img src="p0003.jpg">
</p>


<p>
The cones have now (next Figure) rotated so that the green cone's rim 
is at the string's starting point.  The string again wraps around the cone by 180&deg;
but since this (green) cone is more "open" than the previous (blue) cone, the string 
has to bend and stretch differently.  It is this bending and stretching that makes the
strings' motion look complicated.  But now you know it is very simple. 
</p>

<p align="center">
 <img src="p0004.jpg">
</p>

<p>
In the next Figure, the cones have rotated such that the rim of the more open blue cone 
is at the starting point of the string.
</p>

<p align="center">
 <img src="p0005.jpg">
</p>

<p>
Here, the string is in a plane (no cone shown) with other strings.  The cone in this case would be 
maximum open (flat).
</p>

<p align="center">
 <img src="p0006.jpg">
</p>

<p>
As the cones continue to rotate, the string next encounters (in our Fugires) the 
redish-pink cone.
</p>

<p align="center">
 <img src="p0007.jpg">
</p>

<p>
Then the orange and red cones.
</p>

<p align="center">
 <img src="p0008.jpg">
 <img src="p0009.jpg">
</p>

<p>
Note that in the about Figure where the string is wrapped around the red cone, the string is 
wrapped in a counter-clockwise direction.  As the cones continue to rotate, the starting point
of the string again encounters the rim of the red cone, but this time at the left side of the cone.
Whereas in the previous Figure, the string seems to be going "up and around", now it seems to be 
going "down and around".  This is how the strings appear to wrap "up and over" the center sphere
through half of the cycle and then "down and under" through the other half of the cycle.
</p>

<p align="center">
 <img src="p0010.jpg">
</p>

<p>
And so on through the rest of the cycle (the rest of the rotation of all the cones.)
</p>

 <img src="p0012.jpg">
</p>

 <img src="p0014.jpg">
</p>

<p align="center">
 <img src="p0015.jpg">
 <img src="p0016.jpg">
</p>


<p>
Although confusing to watch, here is an animation of the cone structure rotating.
</p>

      </EMBED>
    </OBJECT>
</p>

<p>
Note that I have only shown a few cones in these animations.  Actually, think of a dense packing,
or continuous packing of concentric cones so that there is no gap between one cone an another.  
That is how the stings' smooth motion is derived.
</p>

<p>
With this construct of cones in mind and with the cone structure simply rotating 
around the rotation axis, it is easy to program any one strings motion.
