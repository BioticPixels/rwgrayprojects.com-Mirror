<h1 align="center">Icosahedra In 30-Verti</h1>

<br><br>

<p>
The 30-Verti has 60 edges.
</p>


<div align="center">

<p>
It is possible to position an Icosahedron in the 30-Verti by using the mid-edge points
of 12 of the edges of the 30-Verti.
</p>


<div align="center">

<p>
Because 60 / 12 = 5, one is lead to conjecture that you can fit 5 Icosahedra in the
30-Verti using only the 30-Verti mid-edge points.  This is indeed the case.

Here is an animation showing all 5 Icosahedra within the 30-Verti.

<p>
These are the 5 "alternate" Icosahedra in the corresponding 5 intersecting Octahedra.
</p>

<p>
Recall that dividing the edges of the Octahedron into Golden Ratio segments creates 
new vertices along the Octahedron's edges.  Connecting these new vertices together 
defines an Icosahedron within the Octahedron.  
</p>

<p>
But there are 2 different ways to divide an edge into Golden Ratio segments, depending on
from which of the 2 ends of the edge you measure from.
</p>


<div align="center">

</div>

<p>
In the above Figure, the white and blue Icosahedra show the 2 Icosahedra in an octahedron.
</p>

<p>
So, for every Octahedron, there are 2 Icosahedra within defined by cutting the Octahedron's
edges into Golden Ratios.
</p>

<p>
Considering the matrix of 5 Octahedra, there are then 10 Icosahedra defined.
</p>

<p>
See 
<a href="../../Universe/10Icosa10Dodeca/10Icosa/10Icosa.html">
"10 Icosahedra"
</a> for more detail on this.
</p>

<p>
5 of the Icosahedra become coincident with one another and can not be distinguished. 
</p>

<p>
The remaining 5 "alternative" Icosahedra are distinguishable.  And these are the 5 Icosahedra
defined by the mid-edge points of the 30-Verti.
