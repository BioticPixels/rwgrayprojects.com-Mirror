<H1>Does Sweet's Work Explain Searl's Device?</H1>
</DIV>
<P>
Floyd Sweet claims to have obtained over unity electrical energy effects 
by applying a special magnetization process to some ferrite magnets.
His setup consisted of one or more specially conditioned magnets and 
at least 2 coils.  The magnets are fixed (stationary).  One coil was used to 
excite or begin the oscillations of the magnets with a small AC field.  
The other coil(s) were used to "pick up" the magnet's large magnetic 
oscillations. (Clearly a non-linear effect occurs here for the excitation 
AC magnetic field is small compared to the output.) 

<P>
See, for example, 
<A HREF="http://www.primenet.com/~ajdubla/vta/index.htm">Alan Dubla's web pages</A> 
and 
<A HREF="http://www.eskimo.com/~billb/freenrg/sweetvta.html">this article</A>
for a more detailed description of Floyd Sweet's devices.
</P>

<P>
I have also investigated Prof. John Searl's magnetic motor/generator.  
After spending a couple of years volunteering my time with 
<A HREF="http://www.servtech.com/~discjt">D.I.S.C. Inc. USA</A>
to help Prof. Searl reproduce his device according to his explanations 
and instructions, I have not been able to figure out by what physical bases
Prof. Searl claims his devices worked. (Note: I have not worked <I>directly</I>
with Prof. Searl.  However, the group working here in the USA was in 
direct and frequent contact  with Prof. Searl.) He has developed a construction
method which he calls "The Laws of Squares" which, in my opinion, is so far
removed from the language of physics and engineering that one is left 
completely in the dark as to the cause of the motion in his devices.
We are therefore free to think up our own methods and explanations for
constructing a device in which magnets are "self-propelled". 
</P>

<P>
Here is a ruff illustration of Searl's setup.  For more detail
on Searl's devices see the info 
<A HREF="http://www.geocities.com/ResearchTriangle/Lab/1135/searl.html">at this web site</A>
or just search the web.

<P>
What is most interesting for the following comparison
is the similarity (but not perfect match) between
Sweet's method of conditioning the magnets and Searl's magnetization
process.  In both cases, an AC field is applied to the material.  
(There is more detail, of course, to both Sweet's and Searl's magnetization
process.  I am only pointing out the most obvious similarity here.)
</P>

<P>
So, is there a way to use Sweet's effect to produce a Searl-like 
magnetic motor?
</P>

<P>
Consider "large" but "slow" magnetization vector oscillations cohered
(in sync) to produce traveling waves.  It would then be possible for the wave
to "pull" (or "push") a disk magnet along with it.  This is illustrated
in the next figure in which a disk magnet (red) moves along a magnetization
vector oscillation traveling wave.
</P>

</DIV>

<P>
If such waves can be created <B>around</B> a cylinder (or ring) then it might 
be possible to move the stacks of disks around this center cylinder. 
</P>

<P>
In Sweet's work, a small AC excitation is needed to begin the 
larger magnetization oscillations. Applying this concept to the
Searl-like arrangement, the disks rolling around the center cylinder
would be "seen" by the center cylinder as small "excitation" 
magnetic oscillations.  
</P>

<P>
Searl says that his first
devices needed to be "started".  That is, the stack of disk magnets 
need an external source to start them rolling.  This could have 
excited large magnitude oscillations in the center cylinder 
in a similar way that Sweet's small excitations started the large 
magnetization oscillations in his magnets. 
</P>

<P>
One problem that I see with this arrangement is that I would not
expect the wave length to be so large that the disks fit between 
wave crests.  I would expect the wave length on the center cylinder
to be much smaller.  Then it is doubtful that the disks would be
carried along.
</P>

<P>
This may be why Searl claims that <B><I>both</I></B> the center
cylinder (actually, its a ring in Searl's set-up) <B><I>and</I></B>
the disks need to be specially magnetized (conditioned).  The result
may be another magnetization wave around the disks.  These waves
in the disks coupled with the wave in the center cylinder may be
like two gears in which their teeth mesh.  (Searl says that the
frequency used to magnetize the disks is not to be the same as
that used for the center ring.  So it is not clear whether or not
this "gear" analogy is appropriate.)
</P>

<P>
In a static condition (that is, considering the center cylinder alone with no
disks around it)  The magnetization vector wave might "stop" (might not
be <I>traveling</I> around the cylinder) but it might retain its alternating
"pattern" around the periphery of the cylinder.  This might be the origin of 
the "pattern" that Prof. Searl claims is measured around his center ring.
</P>

<P>
Both Sweet and Searl claim that once the oscillation started and they 
extracted energy from their devices the magnets would become very cold.
</P>

<P>
I have read that in ferromagnets, the magnetization vectors of the material 
are constantly oscillating.  But the oscillations are chaotic/random.  Sweet
may have found a way to cohere or "order" these oscillations with a non-linear
oscillating result.  And Searl (independent of Sweet) might be using these 
oscillations to "carry" the stacks of disk magnets around the center cylinder.
</P>


<P>
It is claimed that another researcher by the name of 
<A HREF="http://www.geocities.com/CapitolHill/3752/indexe.html">Hans Coler</A>
was also
able to induce "large" oscillations in ferromagnets.  I don't think 
there was any kind of special "magnetization" process involved, but I could
be wrong. 
</P>


<P>
As far as I can determine, "large" scale coherence of magnetic
oscillations is not known to exist in "large" magnets.  
(But then neither are the over unity effects produced by Sweet, Searl
and Coler!)  
</P>

<P>
On the other hand, "small" coherent oscillations are know to exist 
in magnetic material.
</P>

<P>
If you want to read up on magnetic oscillations, take a look at the 
following books.   
</P>

<P>
<UL>
<LI>Magnetization Oscillations and Waves, by A.G. Gurevich and G.A. Melkov,
    CRC Press, 1996  
<LI>Theory of Magnetostatic Waves, by D.D. Stancil, Springer-Verlag, 1993
<LI>Magnetostatic Waves and Their Application, by P. Kabos and V.S. Stalmachov,
    Chapman & Hall, 1994
</UL>
</P>

<P>
These books mention the use of a DC magnetic "bias" field together with an
AC magnetic field being applied to the magnetic material sample to induce 
various kinds of oscillations.  This technique is called "parallel pumping". 
It is clear, to me, that AC magnetization techniques have been applied to
small sample magnetic material now for many years.  But the science 
folks don't seem to have applied such techniques on the "large scale" 
as have Sweet and Searl.
