<H1>Is A Dipole Motor Possible?</H1>
</DIV>

<HR>

<P>
In this article, I will review a motor design I invented
which uses the interaction of Dipoles as its motive 
source.  I will first describe the device in general, "loose"
language.  At the end of this article, I will list all the 
assumptions I have made along with specific equations.
</P>

<P>
I have <B><I>not</I></B> built this motor.  Nor do I know
if it will really work.  "Physics" says that this
motor is impossible because if it worked, it would
generate more energy out than the energy input.
</P>

<P>
However, I am unable to figure out exactly way 
this motor will not run.  So, I am hoping that you
will find a flaw in my reasoning.  I am hoping to 
learn what it is I have overlooked.  It bugs me that
I can not find the flaw in my reasoning.  I really
hope you can.
</P>

<P>
So let's begin....
</P>

<HR>

<P>
First, let's consider a real example that you can try.
</P>

<P>
Let's use two magnets as our two dipoles.
</P>

<P>
Keeping one dipole in a fixed position and not letting 
it rotate, take the second magnet and move it around 
the first. You will find that for some orientations
and positions of the second magnet you can feel 
the repulsive and attractive forces between the two
dipoles/magnets.
</P>

<P>
Now, with the first magnet still fixed in place, 
put the second magnet a few inches away from the 
first like this.
</P>

<IMG SRC="dm01.gif">

<P>
The orientaion of the second magnet, which you are going
to move, with respect to the first magnet 
is very important. Make sure you have the orientation 
correct. 
</P>

<P>
Now move the second magnetic in a circle around the 
first, stationary magnet.  <B><I>Keep the orientation
the second magnet so that it is always pointing "up".</I></B>
</P>

<IMG SRC="dm02.gif">

<P>
You will feel the second magnet being pushed away from
the first.  Then, as you move it around the first magnet,
keeping the orientation pointing "up", there will
be a region for which you will feel the second magnet
being attracted to the first magnet.
</P>

<P>
As you continue to move the second magnet around the 
first, you will find that there are four different
regions. Two attractive and two repulsive.
</P>

<IMG SRC="dm03.gif">

<P>
Notice that there are two black lines showing where
the repulsive region turns into an attractive region and
visa versa.
</P>
<P>
For all positions along these lines, as long as the second magnet
continues to point "up", there will be neither a repulsive 
nor an attractive radial force on the second magnet.
</P>

<P>
Can we use this bit of information to build
a self-running dipole magnet motor?
</P>

<P>
Let us position a wheel such that its axis of rotation is on
one of these lines.  Then 1/2 of the wheel will always be in 
a repulsive region while the other 1/2 of the wheel will 
be in an attractive region.
</P>

<IMG SRC="dm04.gif">

<P>
Can we make this wheel rotate by placeing magnets around its rim?
</P>

<P>
Well, if we can can somehow make the magnets we place around
the rim of the wheel in such a way as to also have these 
magnets pointing "up", no matter what the orientation of the
wheel is, then there will be a net radial repulsive force
on 1/2 of the wheel and a net radial attractive force on the
other 1/2 of the wheel and the wheel should rotate.
</P>

<IMG SRC="dm05.gif">

<P>
Unfortunately, things are far from being that simple.
Look what happens when the wheel now rotates just a little.
</P>

<IMG SRC="dm06.gif">

<P>
Clearly, the magnets on the rim of the wheel are no longer pointing
"up". This means that the "repulsive" and "attractive" regions 
are no longer repulsive and attractive.  The wheel will turn 
a little and stop. 
</P>

<P>
We need to make the magnets on the wheels rim rotate as the wheel
rotates so they are always pointing "up".
</P>

<P>
There may be several ways to do this.  What comes to my mind right
off is a gearing system.
</P>

<P>
By using 3 gears, all with the same radius and number of teeth, we 
can keep the magnets at the wheel rim always pointing "up".
</P>

<IMG SRC="dm07A.gif">

<IMG SRC="dm07B.gif">
 


<P>
Of course this is all and idealization and so not exactly true.  The mathematics 
says that for idealized <I>point</I> dipoles, there wouldn't
be any radial force on the dipoles.  But, we don't have
idealized dipoles.  The magnets are far from point sized.
</p> 

<P>
The interaction between two dipoles is represented by
an equation.  The equation is usually presented as the
potential energy between the two dipoles.  When this
potential energy function is differentiated with respect
to one of the dipole's position, keeping the other 
dipole fixed at the coordinate origin, we get the 
force equation between the two dipoles.
</P>

<P>
It is the force equation, not th energy equation, that
I considered here.
</P>
