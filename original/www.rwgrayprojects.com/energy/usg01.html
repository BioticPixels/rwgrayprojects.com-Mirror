<H2 align="center">Keeping Inventors Quiet</H2>
<P>
If you were an inventor trying to patent an important new-energy
discovery, you might receive a secrecy order along the lines
of the one reproduced here.  According to information obtained
under the Freedom of Information Act by the Federation of American
Scientists, the Pentagon placed 774 patent applications under
secrecy orders in 1991--up from 290 in 1979--and 506 of these orders
were imposed on inventions by private companies.  The government has
standing gag orders on several thousand inventions.  The following
order, issued in the 1980s, was obtained by inventor Ken MacNeill
of Georgia and revealed in 1983.
