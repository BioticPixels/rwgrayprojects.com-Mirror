<H1>My Solution To The Most Important Problem...</H1>
</DIV>
<P>
I have invented what I hope will turn out to be one solution
to the problem of electrical energy generation.  Below is an
animated picture of the general setup.  (Note:  This configuration/setup
is based on John R. R. Searl's devices.  The discovery, invention and explanation
of how to make a device like this work, described in these pages, is my own.
The significant differences between my device and those of Searl are given below.) 
Cylindrical stacks of disk shaped 
magnets (red) self-rotate around a stationary center magnetic field 
source (orange).

<P>
The cylindrical stack of disk shaped magnets move around the 
central magnetic field source
on their own.  No "external" energy input is needed for these magnets
to rotate about the center field source.   
</P>


<P>
What makes this "self-rotation" possible is the special
magnetization process applied to each of the disk shaped 
magnets (red).  The special magnetization creates 
special kinds of magnetic bubbles in these magnets. 
</P>

<P>
To my knowledge, no one has written or otherwise disclosed
the application of magnetic bubbles <B><I>for the purpose of moving the
material containing the magnetic bubbles.</I></B>  For this reason,
I have applied for two USA patents. Specifically, my patent applications
pertains to the <B><I>utilization of magnetic bubbles</I> for the purpose of 
moving the material</B> which contains the magnetic bubbles.  My
invention and patent applications does not attempt to patent a
specific configuration of the magnets (for example, the design
shown above) but rather, patents the usage of magnetic bubbles to
"propel" the magnets. 
</P>

<P>
I have recently (Dec., 1999) been issued the two patents
I applied for.  They are:


   <A HREF="US06008709.pdf">
    USA Patent Number 6,008,709
  </A>
and 
   <A HREF="US06002314.pdf">
    USA Patent Number 6,002,314
  </A>

</P>

<P>
Prof. John R. R. Searl claims to have invented a similar device
back in the late 1940's or early 1950's.  There are a couple of web
sites for Searl's invention including 
<A HREF="http://www.sisrc.com/">
Direct International Science Consortium (DISC)
</A>
and
<A HREF="http://searleffect.com/">
DISC, USA.

There are several other sites which contain information on Prof. Searl's
work.  Just do a web serach and you will find all kinds of information.

For a closer look at the similarities and differences between
Prof. Searl's device (as described in his books) and my invention,
I provide the following comparison.

<P>
I have <B><I>not</I></B> built this device.  I am currently
in need of a magnetization device suitable for generating 
magnetic bubbles.  (See the "Details" sections.)  I have contacted
several companies in an attempt to have a magnetization device
constructed.  It seems that the coils needed are not a problem
but the electronics involved are more than anyone wants to 
deal with.  Until this problem is solved I will not be able to
proceed with experimentation.
