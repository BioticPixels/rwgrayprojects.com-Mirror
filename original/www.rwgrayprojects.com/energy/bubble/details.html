<H2 ALIGN=center>Introduction</H2>

<P>
Magnetic bubbles are nothing new.  They have been studied mainly from
the point of view of using them in information technology
devices (e.g. "bubble memory" device).
However, the unique properties of magnetic bubbles may be used
for other applications.  I have applied their unique properties
to the design of various magnet bubble motors.  
</P>

<H2 ALIGN=center >Magnetic Bubbles</H2>

<P>
Magnetic bubbles are (idealized) cylindrical regions in magnetic material
in which the magnetization direction is reversed with respect to outside 
the cylindrical region.
If a magnetic material were magnetized to have its magnetic
north pole face on the "top" and its south pole face on the
"bottom" of the material, then the faces of the cylindrical magnetic 
bubble region would have its south pole face on the top side and 
its north pole face on the bottom side of the magnetic material.

<P>
Notice that the magnetic bubble has a "bubble wall" through which the 
magnetization vector (indicated by an arrow) has to change its direction 
by 180 degrees.  
</P>

<P>
Of particular interest, for my magnetic bubble motor,
are "hard" magnetic bubbles.  
For hard magnetic bubbles, not only does the magnetization
vector rotate by 180 degrees in the bubble wall, it also 
twists.  Not only does the magnetization vector twist, it 
can twist in either a clockwise or a counter clockwise direction. 
Here are two magnetic bubbles.  One has its magnetization vector 
twisting clockwise while the other bubble has its magnetization vector 
twisting counter clockwise.

<P>
The number of twists in the bubble wall is called the state number (S).  
</P>

<P>
Hard magnetic
bubbles move through the material at a non-zero 
"deflection" angle (-90 < angle < +90 degrees)
with respect to the direction of an externally applied magnetic field gradient.
(A magnetic field gradient is just the direction in which the
magnetic field is getting stronger.)

</P>

<P>
The reason for this deflection away from the direction
of the magnetic field gradient can be (loosely) explained as follows.
</P>

<P>
When a hard magnetic bubble is placed in a magnetic field
gradient its wall structure changes.  The twists (or "Bloch lines") 
bunch together on either the left or right hand side of the 
magnetic bubble (with respect to the magnetic field gradient direction.)
</P>

<P>
It is important to note that
this rearrangement of the bubble's wall structure is a <B><I>static</I></B>
property.  That is, it does not depend on the bubble moving through the
material.
</P>

<P>
Since the magnet bubble's wall structure is no longer
symmetrical with respect to the magnetic field gradient 
direction, the forces on the two halves (left, right sides) of the magnetic bubble
as it moves through the material will not be balanced.
</P>

<P>
It is important to note that the force perpendicular to the 
direction of the magnetic field gradient (the 
"sideways" force) is a <B><I>dynamic</I></B>
force.  That is, it only occurs if the magnetic bubble is moving 
through the material.
</P>

<P>
Now lets see how we can use these hard magnetic bubbles
to build a magnetic bubble motor.
