<P>
Let us now review the "special" magnetization
process for generating the hard bubbles in the disk 
magnets.  Since I do not (yet) have
the equipment to do the special magnetization
required, I can not give you exact details.
However, the general process (mostly from the
literature on the formation of hard magnetic bubbles
in garnet materials) is as follows:
</P>

<P>
The disk magnets to be magnetized are to be placed in 
a constant (DC) magnetic field close to the material's
magnetic saturation.  Then, short magnetic <B><I>pulses</B></I> are to
be applied.  The pulses should have a rise time of approximately 1 micro-second.
(1x10^-6 seconds)  The DC magnetic field plus the pulsed magnetic field 
should probably not saturate the material.
</P>
<P>
According to the literature, the formation of hard
magnetic bubbles can be enhanced if the material is
cooled.  In some materials, formation of hard
magnetic bubbles is "suppressed" at room temperature.
The amount of cooling required will depend
on the material used.  I recommend trying "dry ice" as
it is less expensive than liquid nitrogen.

</P>
<P>
Now for the most questionable aspect...
</P>

<P>
We don't want just any old type of hard
magnetic bubbles.  We need the magnetic bubbles to be 
either all S = positive or all S = negative.  (Their "state"
signs need to be the same.)
We might be able to accomplish this if we place the 
disk magnet in an electric field <B><I>during</I></B>
the magnetization process.  The idea being that
the electric field will give a preferred direction
to the "twisting" of the magnetization vector during
the formation of the hard magnetic bubbles.
The strength of this 
electric field will need to be determined and will 
probably vary depending on the type of magnetic material
used.  (Note that this is the only aspect of the magnetization
process for which I can find no reference in the scientific
literature.  So I am not 100% certain that the application
of the electric field will work as described.  If it doesn't then
some other method will need to be found to "load up" the disk
magnet with thousands of hard bubbles all with the same state sign.)
(I have seen a reference to Floyd Sweet's work in which it is 
claimed that he used both an AC magnetic field, cooled the magnets
and sometimes applied an electric field during the magnetization.)
</P>

<P>
I would recommend trying the ferrite magnetic materials first.   I have
many anisotropic Barium Ferrite disk magnets all ready to be tried as soon as the
magnetizer is built.  I also plain to try anisotropic Strontium Ferrite disks as these are easy to
obtain and are comparatively inexpensive.
</P>

<P>
As with any area of research, there is a <B><I>lot</I></B>
more detail involved.  But I hope I have given you the basic idea
behind my magnetic motor idea.
