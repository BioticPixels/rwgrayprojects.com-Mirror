The following is taken from the back cover of Jeane Manning's
book <I>The Coming Energy Revolution</I>.
</P>
<P>
There is a new and exciting revolution coming.  It will 
dramatically change our landscape, our environment, our
economy, and our lives.  It will provide each and every 
one of us with a truely unique sense of independence.  It
will mark the end of oil-influenced politics, and the beginning 
of a bright new millennium--a time in which we all will 
have our own unlimited sources of nonpolluting energy.
<I>The Coming Energy Revolution</I> provides us with
an intriguing and insightful look at the forces behind the 
free-energy movement.
</P>
<P>
<I>The Coming Energy Revolution</I> ontroduces us to some of the 
inventors, both past and present, who have insisted
that we are surrounded by a sea of energy that we
can tap once we have learned nature's secrets.  Conventional
science says that space is cold and still, and that what energy
does exist cannot be put to useful work.  The new-energy
innovators say that conventional science is wrong, and that
new-energy research is being suppressed by a combination of
scientific inertia and corporate self-interest.  But the
suppression connot last, as this book shows--there are simply
too many inventors who are close to new-energy breakthroughs.
</P>
<P>
<I>The Coming Energy Revolution</I> examines the technologies
on which these inventors are working.  There are magnets that
can redirect the energy of space.  There is a gentler form
of nuclear energy that can take place on a table top.
There is a hydrogen, a clean, abundant fuel that can be produced 
wherever needed.  There is a form of hydropower that does
not rely on massive dams.  And there are other forms of new energy.
<I>The Coming Energy Revolution</I> looks at them all, and at 
the kinds of changes that will be needed to overcome the 
roadblocks between our old-energy
present and out new-energy future.
