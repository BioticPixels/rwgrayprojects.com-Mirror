<H1 ALIGN=center>Bubbles Bursting?</H1>
<BR>
<P>
In recent years I have done two types of experimentation relating 
to electromagnetism, (1) interactions of toroidal magnets I have 
termed "VACE's" (virtual Ampèrian current elements) and (2) the 
so-called Marinov motor (MM).  It now appears that both these 
bubbles are about to burst.  Here, for whatever interest, are 
the circumstances:
</P>

<P>
(1)  VACE:  Hitherto I have worked with Alnico U-magnets paired to 
roughly approximate the toroidal (doughnut) shape.  (The ideal 
shape would be a thin washer with a small central hole.)  I found 
that the U-magnet toroids interacted with many milligrams of 
force at separations somewhat greater than their dimensions, 
with force varying as about the inverse 5th-6th power of separation, 
and with angular dependence simulating Ampèrian current elements, 
as I had expected.  (This is not quite the same as dipole-dipole 
angular interaction, though similar.)  However, my measurements 
were only of the component of force parallel to the line between 
the VACE centers.  As Wesley, Graneau, and others have noted, in 
addition to the forces parallel to the inter-element line there are 
also torques exerted between VACE's due to their finite lateral 
dimensions.  These were ignored by my measurements and publications 
on the VACE subject.  Because separations are comparable with 
lateral dimensions, these torques are strong and can have a 
big effect.  R. W. Gray, at his web site 
<A HREF="vace01.html">
http://www.rwgrayprojects.com/energy/VACE/vace01.html
</A>
describes a very ingenious "paradox" whereby a perpetually turning 
motor can be built from VACE's if my Ampèrian law of angular 
interaction fully describes their interactions.  To make sure, 
I built one of the motors he describes, using Edmund stock no. 38107 
Alnico U-magnets.  Sure enough, the simulated Ampèrian forces 
act to start rotation, but this is immediately arrested by strong 
counter-forces due to the neglected torques mentioned above.  How 
can these torques be directly verified?  One way is with an analytic 
balance:  Put a test VACE on the balance pan, as in my reported 
measurements, and then put the force-exerter VACE not above it, 
as I had it, but to the side, level with the test VACE.  That way 
the (horizontal) inter-element line is perpendicular to the 
(vertical) line of measured force component action.  If the two 
elements were infinitesimal, as Ampère assumed, Newton's third law 
would predict zero force.  But because of the finite extent of 
the actual VACE's their various parts have strongly 
separation-dependent interactions, with resulting non-zero force.  
I have not done such measurements, but have done a much simpler 
equivalent:  I made a horizontal 4-inch diameter Lucite disk 
supported on a central ball bearing race, so that it rotated very 
easily.  Near the disk edge I placed one or more of the U-magnet 
VACE's, so oriented that each simulated a current element pointing 
azimuthally, say, clockwise (simulating Gray's motor).  Opposite 
one of these, I brought up by hand another VACE pointing radially.  
Disk rotation through a short distance to a new position of 
equilibrium was observed.  This simulated the balance experiment 
just discussed, and showed that a net non-zero force is exerted 
perpendicular to the inter-element line.  This is not a violation 
of Newton's third law, because it results from the finite 
lateral extent of the VACE's, coupled to strong interactions of 
their closest portions.  Conclusion:  Nature has contrived a more 
complicated interaction of real VACE's, including torques not 
considered in my previous analyses, of just such a character as 
to refute Gray's paradox of perpetual motion.  His VACE motor does 
not work, and I hope nobody else will waste time and money to 
verify this.

<P>
A worse disappointment ensued:  The whole VACE idea may prove to be 
an artifact of flux leakage from U-magnet pairs.  This conclusion 
is suggested by the following facts:  With the U-magnets the forces 
observed at separations comparable to their size are of the order 
of hundreds of milligrams.  But I have just received from 
Charles M. Andrews of Arnold Engineering Co. the very generous 
gift of several Alnico 5 (?) ring magnets about an inch in 
diameter <I>circularly magnetized</I>.  These he had in stock ... I thought 
no such existed, but I was wrong.  I find that there is very 
little interaction between these magnets unless they are brought 
into physical contact.  At separation distances comparable with 
their size the interaction forces are of the order of 1-10 milligrams 
at most.  Of course, there is no perfection of circular 
magnetization ... the magnetizing current might be a bit 
off-center.  So, it is quite plausible that again these small 
residual forces are due to flux leakage, and they just happen 
(more or less accidentally, so to speak) to resemble the angular 
dependence of the Ampere inter-current-element force law, as far 
as actions along the inter-element line are concerned.  Thus 
the magnetic interaction physics of VACE's may be wholly 
conventional - the Lorentz force law - after all.

(2)  MM:  So far only two investigators have successfully built 
a "direct MM," that is, a motor in which the central magnetic 
toroid is fixed in the lab and the surrounding ring rotates 
continuously.  J. D. Kooistra has built and repeatedly demonstrated 
a working model, and Cyril Smith in England has reported actual 
torque measurements in rough agreement with a theory based on 
an unconventional force law <B>F</B> = -<I>qd</I><B>A</B><I>/dt</I>, 
which has recommended itself 
(to me on theoretical grounds and also to J. P. Wesley) as 
indicating physical significance of the vector potential <B>A</B>.  
The conventional Lorentz force law predicts no ring rotation.  
Many other people, including myself, have built "inverse MM's" in 
which the ring is stationary and the inner torus rotates up to 
90 degrees to a new equilibrium position (so that with current 
commutation the rotation becomes continuous).  But that version 
appears possibly explicable by the Lorentz force law, so it does 
not count (except as a new motor type of possible practical 
interest).  Now comes the bubble-bursting part:  Kholmetskii 
in Minsk and Valverde in Argentina have independently tried 
to build direct MM's and have failed.  I know little of the Minsk 
work, but have the following data from Valverde:  A large, 
toroidal permanent magnet of 10000 gauss (1 Tesla) was surrounded 
by a conducting ring carrying currents up to 100 amps DC.  The 
electrical contacts allowing rotation were, I believe, mercury.  
But no rotation occurred.  This is very life-threatening to the 
whole idea, because 100 amps should have moved mountains.  At the 
moment the MM is under a cloud.  The topic is a puzzle.
