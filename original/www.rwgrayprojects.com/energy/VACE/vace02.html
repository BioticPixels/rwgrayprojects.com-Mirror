Ampere developed an equation for the force between 2 current elements.

<P>
Ampere's equation can be written as

Epsilon is the angle through which current element #2 has to be
rotated to point in the same direction as current element #1.
Consider the line drawn from current element #2 through 
current element #1.  Then the angle alpha is the angle through which current
element #1 must be rotated to point along this line.  And beta is
the angle though which current element #2 must be rotated to point 
along this line.
</P>


<P>
The first thing to point out is that an "Ampere current element"
is not the same thing as the "electron flow current" you learned about 
in physics or electrical engineering classes.  For a discussion
of this see the books <U>Newtonian Electrodynamics</U> by Peter Graneau and
Neal Graneau, World Scientific, 1996 and <U>Ampere-Neumann
Electrodynamics of Metals, 2nd edition</U> by Peter Graneau, Hadronic Press, 1994. 
</P>

<P>
It has been suggested that an Ampere current element may be realized
by circularly magnetizing a torus or a flat ring ("washer") shaped 
magnet so that all
of the magnetic "field lines" are internal to the magnetic material.
These magnets have been called VACEs.  
VACE stands for Virtual Ampere Current Element.  
</P>

<P>
If this does indeed give a realization to Ampere current elements
then it might be possible to realize a non-magnetic magnet motor
which requires no electrical input to run.  By "non-magnetic" I
mean that the magnetic fields are not "used", but the magnet as a 
whole, properly magnetized, is used.
So, we would have a non-magnetic magnet motor.
</P>

<P>
For example, arrange the washer VACE magnets in a circle
to form a torus.  This results in the Ampere current elements
aligned along a circle.
</P>

<P>
Next, place another VACE external to the torus of VACEs such that
it is pointing toward the center of the torus.  The current elements
making up the torus and the external current element are all <I>in the
same plain.</I>
</P>

<P>
Question:  What is the net torque on the torus of VACEs about the torus
symmetry axes?
</P>


<P>
Using Ampere's force equation, we can calculate the force on
each of the current elements.  We find that there is a net torque
on the torus about its symmetry axes.  So the torus should
self-rotate. 
</P>

<DIV ALIGN=center>

</DIV>


<P>
To see this, we calculate the magnitude of the Ampere force
on each of the VACEs in the torus due to the single external
VACE.  The
following diagram gives the results.
</P>

<DIV ALIGN=center>
<IMG SRC="orien03.gif">
</DIV>

<P>
In the above diagram, the circle represents the collection
of VACEs which form the torus.  At each VACE location 
there is a "force magnitude" drawn.  These lines do not 
indicate the direction of the force.  They only represent the
relative magnitude of the force.  Those lines which are drawn inside
the circle represent repulsive forces away from the single
external VACE.  Those lines drawn outside the circle represent
attractive forces toward the external VACE.  The direction of
each force is along the line joining the external VACE and the
VACE in the torus for which the force is being calculated. 
</P>

<P>
Lets do a little "sanity check" by carrying out the calculation
for 3 of the VACEs in the torus as shown below. 
</P>


<DIV ALIGN=center>
<IMG SRC="sc01.gif">
</DIV>

<P>
We are really only interested in the angular part of Ampere's force
equation.  
</P>
<P>
For I1 and I2, beta = 0, alpha = 90 degrees and epsilon = 90 degrees.
So, cos(epsilon) = 0 and cos(alpha) = 0 which means the force is zero.
</P>

<P>
Next consider I1 and I3 for which beta = 10 degrees, alpha = 110 degrees,
and epsilon = 100 degrees.  Then cos(epsilon) = -0.1736,  cos(alpha) = 
-0.3420, and cos(beta) = 0.9848.  The angular part of Ampere's force 
equation is then  
<DIV ALIGN=center>
(2*(-0.1736) - 3*(-0.3420)*(0.9848)) = +0.6632
</DIV>
(The positive sign indicates an attractive force in this sign convension.)
</P>

<P>
Finally consider I1 and I4 for which beta = 10 degrees, alpha = 70 degrees,
and epsilon = 80 degrees.  Then cos(epsilon) = 0.1736,  cos(alpha) = 
0.3420, and cos(beta) = 0.9848.  The angular part of Ampere's force 
equation is then  
<DIV ALIGN=center>
(2*(0.1736) - 3*(0.3420)*(0.9848)) = -0.6632
</DIV>
(The negative sign indicates a repulsive force in this sign convension.)
</P>


<P>
So, we have explicitly calculated that a VACE "a little to the left"
of the external VACE will experience an attractive force while
a VACE "a little to the right" will experience a repulsive force.
This is what "causes" the torus of VACEs to self-rotate.
</P>

<P>
If this is truely the case, then there is no reason to have
just 1 external VACE.  We can position many VACEs all around
the torus, as shown below.
</P>


<DIV ALIGN=center>
<IMG SRC="motor03.gif">
</DIV>


<P>
This, of course. makes no sense from an energy point of view. 
</P>
<P>
In the idealization in which the Ampere current elements form a
continuous circle, there is no difference in energy for any
angle of rotation about the symmetry axis "O" of the torus. 
So, there should be no net torque on the torus about "O".
(Forces and torques only arise if there is an energy difference
between orientations or positions.)
But Ampere's force equation seems to indicate a net torque.
So, if the energy symmetry argument is correct, 
where is the counter force (and torque) coming from?   
</P>

If you can find a problem with this analysis, <B><I>please</I></B>
let me know.  I don't need to be "promoting" ideas known to 
be wrong.
