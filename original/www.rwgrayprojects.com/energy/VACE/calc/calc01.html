<BR>

<P>
Let's look at the torque calculations in some detail.
</P>

<P>
We start with Ampere's force equation
</P>

<DIV ALIGN=center>
<IMG SRC="eq01.gif">
</DIV>


<P>
NOTE: The symbol "r" in Ampere's equation above is the distance
between the two current elements.  Unfortunately, I have used the
symbol "r" in the following diagram and equations as the radius
of the VACE torus circle.  I hope this will not cause you too
much confusion.
</P>

<P>
Consider the following diagram which defines most of the 
symbols to be used. 
</P>

<DIV ALIGN=center>
<IMG SRC="calc01.gif">
</DIV>

<P>
There are 2 Ampere current elements shown.  One at P (I1) and one 
at R (I2).    
</P>

<P>
From this diagram we can see how the following equations 
have been obtainned.
</P>

<DIV ALIGN=center>
<IMG SRC="calc03.gif">
</DIV>

<P>
We next want to express the angle alpha in terms of theta and
the distance "d" (the distance from the circle center "O" to I1 at P.)  
So, consider the following diagram.
</P>

<DIV ALIGN=center>
<IMG SRC="calc02.gif">
</DIV>

<P>
Alpha may seem a little harder to get, but looking at the
diagram we see it is given by
</P>


<DIV ALIGN=center>
<IMG SRC="calc04.gif">
</DIV>

<P>
To rotate I2 to point along the "Force line", I2 is
turned counter-clockwise, whereas I1 is rotated clockwise.  
This is way I chose this equation
for alpha.  Clockwise rotations will be positive, and counter-clockwise 
rotations will be negative.  So, in the above diagram, alpha is negative and beta is
positive.
</P>

<P>
Epsilon, the angle through which current element #2 has to be
rotated to point in the same direction as current element #1
is then given by   
</P>

<DIV ALIGN=center>
epsilon = alpha - beta
</DIV>

<P>
Note that in Ampere's force law, all the angles are 
parameters to cosine functions.  So it doesn't matter if
we use 
</P>

<DIV ALIGN=center>
epsilon = alpha - beta
</DIV>

<P>
or if we use
</P>

<DIV ALIGN=center>
epsilon = beta - alpha
</DIV>

<P>
The cosine of epsilon is the same in either case.
</P>

<P>
We can now use Ampere's force equation to calculate the magnitude
of the force on each VACE in the torus.  (Remember the note at the
top of this page: "r" in Ampere's equation is the distance between the
two current elements and not the radius of the torus.
</P>

<P>
We can use the usual distance equation to obtain the distance between
the two current elements.
</P>


<DIV ALIGN=center>
x1 = r cos(theta)
<BR>
y1 = r sin(theta)
<BR>
<BR>
x2 = d
<BR>
y2 = 0
<BR><BR>
distance "r" = sqrt((x1 - x2)^2 + (y1 - y2)^2)
</DIV>

<P>
Don't worry about the Idl terms in Ampere's equation.  
They can be set to any constant value provided you use that same 
value in all calculations.  We are only after the "relative"
magnitude of the overall torque.
</P>

<P>
O.K., time for the torque...
</P>

<P>
Since we now have the magnitude of the force and we know that the
force will be along the line joining the two current elements
("Force line" in the above diagram) we see that the magnitude of the
torque about "O" is given by
</P>

<DIV ALIGN=center>
torque = r * force * cos(alpha)
</DIV>

<P>
where "r" here is the radius of the circle.
</P>

Well, that's it.  Now just add up each torque about "O" that each VACE in the
torus experiences.
