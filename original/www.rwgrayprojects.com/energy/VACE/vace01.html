<P>
"VACE" stands for Virtual Ampere Current Element.  These are
disk or torus shaped magnets which are circularly magnetized
so that all the "magnetic flux" remains within the magnetic material.
</P>

<P>
It has been suggested that the force between such magnets may 
follow Ampere's force equation for the force between two 
current elements.  If these magnets do follow Ampere's force
law then, as I show below, it should be possible to construct
a self-rotating motor.  That is, a motor with no energy input.
</P>

<P>
In fact, I saw that the interaction of VACE magnets,
or any other kind of material, need only follow the
"angular" term of Ampere's force law for a self-rotating 
motor to be realizable.

Tom Phipps has done several experiments involving "VACEs".  
His results are not encouraging for the idea of 
Amperian current elements as circularly magnetized ring magnets.  
<A HREF=Bburst.html>Here is his report.</A>  (Tom also comments
on the Marinov motor.)
