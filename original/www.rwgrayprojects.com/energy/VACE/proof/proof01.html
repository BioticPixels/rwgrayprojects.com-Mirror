<H2>Proof That F<SUB>L</SUB> = - F<SUB>R</SUB></H2>
</DIV>
<HR>

<BR>

<P>
Consider a VACE (V<SUB>R</SUB>) in the torus at some angle theta.
There is a "mirror" VACE (V<SUB>L</SUB>) on the left side of the
torus.  
</P>

<P>
What we are trying to prove is that the force F<SUB>L</SUB> 
on the left current element I<SUB>L</SUB> 
(due to the single external VACE) is equal to the negative of the
force F<SUB>R</SUB> on the right current element I<SUB>R</SUB>.
</P>

<P>
This is easily seen from the following two illustrations.
</P>

<P>
In the first illustration we see the current element I<SUB>R</SUB>
on the right, tangent to the circle, at some angle theta.  We construct
the mirror of this current element about the right-left dividing line.
This gives I<SUB>M</SUB>.  Note that angles alpha and epsilon are the
same as defined by the right current element.
</P>

<P>
But this mirror current element I<SUB>M</SUB> is pointing in the
wrong direction.  We want the current element on the left 
I<SUB>L</SUB> to point 180 degrees from that of I<SUB>M</SUB>.
</P>

<DIV ALIGN=center>
<IMG SRC="proof02.gif">
</DIV>

<P>
I<SUB>L</SUB> now defines the angles alpha<SUB>L</SUB> and 
epsilon<SUB>L</SUB>.  In particular, we see that 
</P>

<DIV ALIGN=center>
alpha<SUB>L</SUB> = 180 - alpha<SUB>R</SUB>
<BR>
epsilon<SUB>L</SUB> = 180 - epsilon<SUB>R</SUB>
</DIV>

<P>
This changes the angular factor in Ampere's force equation 
by an overall minus sign.
</P>

<DIV ALIGN=center>
2cos(epsilon<SUB>L</SUB>) - 3cos(alpha<SUB>L</SUB>)cos(beta) = 
<BR>
2cos(180 - epsilon<SUB>R</SUB>) - 3cos(180 - alpha<SUB>R</SUB>)cos(beta) =   
<BR>
- (2cos(epsilon<SUB>R</SUB>) - 3cos(alpha<SUB>R</SUB>)cos(beta)) 
</DIV>

<P>
So, F<SUB>L</SUB> = - F<SUB>R</SUB>.
</P>

<P>
This means that for any force on the right that may be "pushing" on the
torus, there is a corresponding force on the left which is "pulling"
on the torus.  The two torques are then additive and do not
sum to zero (unless <B><I>each</I></B> torque is zero.)
</P>

<P>
Therefore, in determining the overall torque on the torus, we need
only calculate the torque on the right hand side and then multiply
by 2.
</P>

<P>
If the sum of all the torques on the right hand side do not sum to
zero, as seems to be the case, then there is a net torque on the
torus and it should rotate.  
</P>
