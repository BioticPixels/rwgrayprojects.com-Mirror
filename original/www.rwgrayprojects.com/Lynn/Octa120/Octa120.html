<P>
The "usual" 120 Polyhedron, or, the one we have labeled as "the" 120 Polyhedron, is essentially 
the rhombic Triacontahedron with its face centers pushed out.  
</P>

<p>
This was done to accommodate 
5 Octahedra.  (An Octahedron has 6 vertices.  So, 5 Octahedra will have 6x5=30 vertices, one 
for each of the 30 faces of the rhombic Triacontahedron.)
</p>


<P>
However, the complex of 5 intersecting Octahedra by itself has 120 trianglular faces.  
Therefore, it is another candidate for Lynnclaire Dennis' "120 Polyhedron". 
</P>


<p>
Here is the build-up of the 5 Octahedra.

</div>


<p>
As you can see, there are 4 triangular faces around each vertex.  So there are 4x30=120 
triangular faces.
</p>


<p>
Each of the 5 Octahedra can be considered to be a Jitterbug.

<p>
Here are some pictures of the paths that the vertices of a single Jitterbug trace out.

And here is an animation which will show all the vertices of the 5 Jitterbugs
following long these paths.

Lynnclaire has said that suring the dynamic motion of the 120 Polyhedron, there is energy
expelled through opennings that form in the polyhedron.  The energy is emitted through one 
type of vertex and is taken back in through another type of vertex.  This is exactly the 
kind of phenomena we see here.  As the triangles of the Jitterbug rotate and move radially, 
their vertices seem to emerge through the Icosahedron-type vertices, follow a curved path, and
sbumerge into Dodecahedron-type vertices.
</p>

<p>
Of course, by reversing the animations you will see the yellow spheres 
of the Jitterbug vertices emerge from the 
Dodecahedron-type vertices and return into the Icosahedron-type vertices.
</p>

<p>
Here is an animation showing both the Icosahedron and the Dodecahedron.

<p>
The motion that Lynnclaire is attempting to describe is more complex than shown here.
In addition, there is a rotational motion which appears to distort the spherical symmetry 
of the system she is describing.  This has not been included here.

Here is the "usual" 120 Polyhedron and the Jitterbug ellipses.
