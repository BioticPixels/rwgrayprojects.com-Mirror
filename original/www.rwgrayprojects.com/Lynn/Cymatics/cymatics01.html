<p>
At the moment I only have time to point to a few links.
</p>

<p>
Its obvious to me that the scientific community investigating "Oscillons" (part
of non-linear dynamics) does not know about Dr. Jenny's work. 
</p>

<p>
There are also far more links to be found on the web than I list here.
</P>

<p>
<ul>
 <li><a href="http://www.cymaticsource.com/index.html">You can get books and
videos of Jenny's work from this source.</a>

<br><br>

 <li><a href="http://super.phys.northwestern.edu/~pbu/">A related phenomenon 
(actually, the same thing) is called "Oscillons".  Here is a link to the 
"discoverer" of Oscillons.</a>

<br><br>

 <li><a href="http://www.sciam.com/1196issue/1196scicit5.html">
     Very short Scientific American article on Oscillons.</a>

</ul>
