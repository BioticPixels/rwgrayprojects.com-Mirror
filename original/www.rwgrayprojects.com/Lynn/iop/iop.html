<H1 ALIGN=center>The Pattern on the Icosahedron</H1>

<P>
I will show you one way that the "Pattern" knot can be
constructed on the Icosahedron.
</P>

<P>
We first construct an Icosahedron.
</P>

<P>
Start with 3 intersecting planes.  The length of each plane is 

p=(1+sqrt(5))/2

while the width is 1.
</P>

<P>
We can build an Icosahedron by connecting the conners of the planes 
together to form 20 identical equilateral triangles as follows.
</P>

<P>
We next want to construct an Octahedron.  Start with 
<B><I>the same</I></B> 3 intersecting planes we used
to construct the Icosahedron.
</P>

<IMG SRC=IMAGE01.gif>

<P>
Note that there are 6 outer-most edges which have a length of 1.
Connect the mid-edge points together to form the Octahedron as follows.
</P>

<IMG SRC=IMAGE14.gif>
<IMG SRC=IMAGE15.gif>

<P>
This shows one way that the Octahedron and the Icosahedron are related.
</P>

<P>
As shown 
<A HREF="../octap/octap.html">here</A>,
The "Pattern" knot can be formed around the Octahedron.
</P>

<P>
This leads us to one way to draw the Pattern knot using the Icosahedron.
