  <title>Scaling In The 120 Polyhedron</title>

<h1 align="center">Scaling in the 120 Polyhedron</h1>

<p>
Recall the 120 Polyhedron.  It has 62 vertices.  The vertices of the 120 Polyhedron are the 
12 vertices of an Icosahedron, 20 vertices of a regular Dodecahedron and 
30 vertices of 5 Octahedra.  (12+20+30=62)
</p>



 <table align="center" border="1"> 
  <tr>
   <td align="center"><img src="P120Icosa01.jpg"></td>
  </tr> 
  <tr>
   <td align="center">Vertices (green) of the Icosahedron<br>
                      which is part of the 120 Polyhedron construction.</td>
  </tr>
 </table> 

<p>
The Icosahedron is just one of many polyhedra defined within the 120 Polyhedron.
</p>

 <table align="center" border="1"> 
  <tr>
   <td align="center"><img src="P120Icosa02.jpg"></td>
  </tr> 
  <tr>
   <td align="center">The unscaled Icosahedron (green) which is<br>
                      part of the 120 Polyhedron construction.</td>
  </tr>
 </table> 

<p>
If we scale the Icosahedron, which is part of the 120 Polyhedron construction, by a factor of
 1.25 (one-and-a-quater) we find that the mid-edge points of the scaled Icosahedron intersect
with the 30 Octahedra vertices of the unscaled 120 Polyhedron. 
</p>

 <table align="center" border="1"> 
  <tr>
   <td align="center"><img src="IcosaS1_25.jpg"></td>
  </tr> 
  <tr>
   <td align="center">The Icosahedron scaled (purple) by 1 1/4 (5/4).</td>
  </tr>
 </table> 

<p>
Here are the 5 Octahedra of the unscaled 120 Polyhedron with the 1.25 scaled Icoahedron.
</p>

 <table align="center" border="1"> 
  <tr>
   <td align="center"><img src="Icosa5Octa.jpg"></td>
  </tr> 
  <tr>
   <td align="center">The 5 Octahedra of the 120 Polyhedron.</td>
  </tr>
 </table> 



<P>
Here is another image showing the mid-edge points, vertices of the 5 Octahedra,
of the scaled Icosahedron.

 <table align="center" border="1"> 
  <tr>
   <td align="center"><img src="OuterIcosa01.jpg"></td>
  </tr> 
  <tr>
   <td align="center">The outer-most verticees of the <br>
                      120 Polyhedron define mid-edge points <br>
                      of a surrounding Icosahedron.</td>
  </tr>
 </table> 


<p>
This correspondence of the scaled Icosahedron's mid-edge points with the 
vertices of the 5 octahedra also holds for the regular Dodecahedron.
</p>
<p>
Scaling the regular Dodecahedron (as it occurs in the 120 Polyhedron) by 1.25 results in
its mid-edge points matching with the vertices of the 5 octahedra.
</p>

</P>

 <table align="center" border="1"> 
  <tr>
   <td align="center"><img src="OctaDodeca01.jpg"></td>
  </tr> 
  <tr>
   <td align="center">Scaled regular Dodecahedron (blue) by a factor of 1.25.</td>
  </tr>
 </table> 

</P>

 <table align="center" border="1"> 
  <tr>
   <td align="center"><img src="OctaDodeca02.jpg"></td>
  </tr> 
  <tr>
   <td align="center">Scaled regular Dodecahedron (blue) by a factor of 1.25.</td>
  </tr>
 </table> 

<p>
This is not surprising since the mid-edge points of the Icosahedron correspond with the 
mid-edge points of the regular Dodecahedron at the scale that these polyhedra occur in the 120 Polyhedron.
(These points are also the face center points of the rhombic Triacontahedron.)
</p>

<p>
Now let us look at reducing the scale of the 120 Polyhedron and the Icosahedron.
</p>


<p>
Consider the orginal (unscaled) 120 Polyhedron (red lines) and its (unscaled) Icoahedron (purple).
</P>

<p>
Put a scaled copy of the 120 Polyhedron (yellow edges) within the original 120 Polyhedron.  
The scale factor is simply 1/2.
</p>

 <table align="center" border="1"> 
  <tr>
   <td align="center"><img src="P120S0_5.jpg"></td>
  </tr> 
  <tr>
   <td align="center">The 120 Polyhedron scaled by 1/2 (yellow edges) <br>
                      inside the original unscaled 120 Polyhedron <br>
                      (red lines) with unscaled Icosahedron (purple).</td>
  </tr>
 </table> 

<p>
Next we scale the Icosahedron (purple) by a factor of 1/(Golden Ratio), which is 
approximately (0.618033989).  We find that the scaled down Icosahedron's mid-edge points match 
the scaled down version of the 120 Polyhedron's outermost (Octahedra) vertices.
</p>  

 <table align="center" border="1"> 
  <tr>
   <td align="center"><img src="IcosaS0_618.jpg"></td>
  </tr> 
  <tr>
   <td align="center">The Icosahedron scaled by 1/(Golden Ratio).</td>
  </tr>
 </table> 

<p>
I find this scaling of the Icosahedron very interesting.
</p>

<p>
If you scale up the Icosahedron by 1.25, the mid-edge points match the outermost vertices of
the unscaled 120 Polyhedron.
</p>
<p>
If you scale down the Icosahedron by 1/(Golden Ratio), the mid-edge points match the 
outermost vertices of the 1/2 scale 120 Polyhedron.
