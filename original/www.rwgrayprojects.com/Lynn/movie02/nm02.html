<P>
In this movie you see the 144 polyhderon spinning around
with the Pattern opening and closing about it.

<P>
This is my first attempt at using the imaging software called
Bryce 3D.  I think you'll agree that the quality of the images
are far better than any other on my web pages.  Byrce 3D is great!
I hope to do more images with Bryce 3D in the future.
