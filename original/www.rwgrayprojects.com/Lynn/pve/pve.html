<H1 ALIGN="center">The Knot Pattern on the VE</H1>

<BIG>
<P>
The "VE", which stands for "Vector Equilibrium", is really
the Cuboctahedron.  I'll show how the edges of the VE 
define Lynnclaire's Pattern Knot. 
</P>

<P>
First, here is a picture of the VE inside a cube.

<DIV ALIGN="center">

<P>
The Pattern Knot can be thought of as 4 intersecting 
"arcs".  For the situation described here, the "arcs"
are made from 4 line segments each.    
</P>

<P>
Here is the first arc of the Pattern Knot drawn in red.
</P>

<DIV ALIGN="center">

<P>
Now for the 2nd arc in a slightly lighter red color.
</P>
 
<DIV ALIGN="center">
  <IMG SRC="im03.gif">
</DIV>


<P>
The 3nd arc is now drawn in green.
</P>
 
<DIV ALIGN="center">
  <IMG SRC="im04.gif">
</DIV>


<P>
And Finally, the 4th arc in pink.
</P>
 
<DIV ALIGN="center">
  <IMG SRC="im05.gif">
</DIV>


<P>
Each arc consists of 4 edges of the VE.  And with
4 arcs all together we have used <NOBR>4 x 4 = 16</NOBR>
edges of the VE.  The VE has a total of 24 edges.  So
there are <NOBR>24 - 16 = 8</NOBR> edges of the VE
"unused" in the Pattern Knot. 
</P>

<P>
NOTE:  I (and others) have shown elsewhere that the knot
can be drawn using 2 straight edges per arc.  I have 
recently shown how to draw the Pattern knot on the 
faces and edges of a cube which results in 3 line
segments per arc.  Now we have the Pattern Knot 
drawn on the VE edges with 4 line segments per arc.
What will 5 line segments per arc correspond to
(if anything)?
