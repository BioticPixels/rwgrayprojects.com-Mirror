  <P>Consider the 3 rings, as shown.
  </P>

  <img src="twist00.jpg"> 

<p>
Cut all 3 rings at one location.  (I will cut the rings in 2 places in the 
illustrations  and remove one half so that the 
rest of the construction process is easier to see.  
You do not really remove 
half of the rings.)
</p>

  <img src="twist01.jpg"> 

<p>
Now rotate one end of the 3 rings by 120 degrees.  (I will add lengths to the 
3 rings, twisting these additions.) All rotations will be clockwise, in this 
example, as seen when looking at the ends to be rotated. 
</p>

<p>
And finally, twist the end of the 3 rings one more time by 120 degrees.  Glue the 
rings back together.

This is the Pattern knot.
