<H1 ALIGN=center>Constructing The Pattern From A Tetrahedron</H1>

<HR>
<P>
Lynnclaire once pointed out to me that if you build the pattern
out of wire you can push on this wire model in such a
way that it will open up and reveal 4 open areas.  It was suggested
that this fully expanded form might be analogous to a tetrahedron.  
</P>

<P>
I have discovered that it fits exactly a tetrahedron.
I show here how to map the pattern onto a tetrahedron. 
</P>

<P>
First, of course, start with a tetrahedron.  (The orientation
of the following image is so that all facets of the tetrahedron
can be seen.)
</P>

<P>
Next, join all the mid-edges together.  This defines an 
octahedron inside the tetrahedron.  Dividing the edges
of the tetrahedron into 2 halfs results in what is called
a 2-frequency tetrahedron.
</P>

<P>
Now draw a circle on each of the tetrahedron's 4 faces.
</P>

</DIV>

<P>
Now we need to trim each of the 4 circles as shown in the following
illustration.  (Note that we are removing 120 degrees from each
of the 4 circles.)
</P>

<DIV ALIGN=center>
<IMG SRC="trim01.gif"><IMG SRC="trim01b.gif">
</DIV>

<P>
We do this now for each of the 4 circles.  It is important to
trim just the right part of each of the circles so that
the pattern will emerge. 
</P>

<P>
The result is the pattern in its open position.  Note that the
2 "cross over/under" points are at the top and bottom of this
illustration and are located at the mid-edge points of 2 of the
tetrahedron's edges.

Here is a movie which might help you get a better
feel for it.

And here are 2 familar perspectives...

<P>
I hope this helps to clarify Lynnclaire's knot pattern in its 
open position.
