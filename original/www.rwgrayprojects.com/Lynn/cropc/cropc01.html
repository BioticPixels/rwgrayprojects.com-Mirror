<H1 ALIGN=center>The Pattern And Crop Circles?</H1>

<HR>

<P>
Some of the images of the pattern remind me of some photos
I have seen of crop circles.  Here are some crop circle
pictures for you to compare.
</P>
<P>
If you know of other images (crop circles or not) that
look like some of the pattern images I have shown, please
send them to me so I can add them here.
</P> 

<P>
I would like to give credit for the person who took 
the photos I will be using here.  So if you
send me some pictures to add here, please tell me who
I should give credit to.
</P>
