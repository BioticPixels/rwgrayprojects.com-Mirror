<P>
Spirituality, Physics Forum to be Held
Academic experts from diverse fields will conduct a public panel
discussion at 2 PM Sunday in Omaha on spirituality, consciousness and
quantum physics.
</P>
<P>
About 20 theoreticians and researchers from around the country,
representing fields as mathematics, philosophy and physics, have met
since Thursday in a kind of think tank called the Sequoia Symposium.
They met at the Thompson Alumni House at the University of Nebraska at
Omaha, where Sunday’s tow-hour forum will be held.
</P>
<P>
Among those participating are Jack Kasher, UNO physics professor who also
lectures on the paranormal, and Lynnclaire Dennis of San Francisco,
author of "The Pattern."
</P>
<P>
Dennis had a near-death experience in 1987 in which she saw a lighted
geometric pattern that has attracted the attention of researchers, some
of whom see her description of it as a potential bridge between physics
and metaphysics.

   "Twelve years ago," the caller said, "I
   was killed in an accident."
</P>
<P>
   Uh-huh. I was tempted to politely hang
   up, but the woman said Jack Kasher had
   suggested she call.
</P>
<P>
   Jack is a respected physics professor at
   the University of Nebraska at Omaha who
   is also open-minded enough to believe in
   angels and to think that Earth might not
   be the only place in the vast universe
   that supports life or beings.
</P>
<P>
   The caller   [Image]<BR>
   last week was  [Image]<BR>
   Lynnclaire  [Image]  [Image]<BR>
   Dennis, 47,   Lynnclaire Dennis<BR>
   who had a  [Image]<BR>
   near-death  [Image]<BR>
   experience in
   1987 in a hot-air balloon race over the
   Austrian Alps. The balloon rose to
   17,000 feet,where there is little
   oxygen, and she lost consciousness. When
   people noticed her, she had no vital
   signs.
</P>
<P>
   The pilot quickly dropped altitude, and
   a physician on board, her fiance,
   revived her.
</P>
<P>
   But while she was up there, something
   happened that is kind of "out there."
   She not only saw a bright light - as
   many people with near-death experiences
   report - but also a detailed geometric
   pattern of light.
</P>
<P>
   In her state, maybe she was just
   dreaming. Or hallucinating. But over a
   period of years, she was able to recall
   the knotlike pattern in such detail, and
   to have it reduced to drawings, that it
   has caught the attention of researchers
   from across the country.
</P>
<P>
   Some of them met for four days during
   the weekend at UNO, ending with a panel
   discussion that drew 130 people besides
   the 20 or so researchers.
</P>
<P>
   Not "X-Files"?
</P>
<P>
   This topic is not your usual newspaper
   fare. Frankly, I wasn't sure I wanted to
   write about it.
</P>
<P>
   It's not exactly from the "X-Files."
   Then again, I looked around the room
   Sunday at UNO's Thompson Alumni Center
   to see if Agents Scully and Mulder had
   slipped in the back door.
<P>
</P>
   With Lynnclaire Dennis' "pattern" as
   their geometric guide, researchers from
   such diverse fields as philosophy,
   mathematics, physics, chemistry and
   biology are looking for nothing less
   than a unified theory of the universe.
</P>
<P>
   Einstein unsuccessfully sought to solve
   that puzzle, and the search continues
   for the key. If they can decode the
   pattern, scholars say, it could have
   real-life ramifications for such areas
   as health and energy production.
</P>
   Dennis is not academically trained in
   this field. She says she was a
   successful businesswoman, "running in
   high-heeled shoes and winning."
<P>
   She has written a book, "The Pattern,"
   but is not on a book tour. And she said
   she refuses to be part of the
   "exploitive, loopy, New Age, woo-woo
   scene."
</P>
<P>
   She added: "This can't ever be about
   making money."
</P>
<P>
   Kasher said the list of scholars trying
   to make sense of her pattern is
   impressive.
</P>
<P>
   "They wouldn't give her the time of
   day," he said, "unless they thought
   there was really something here."
</P>
<P>
   But what?
</P>
<P>
   Among those meeting in Omaha last
   weekend were Louis Kauffman, mathematics
   professor and "knot theorist,"
   University of Illinois-Chicago; Ashok
   Gangadean, professor of philosophy,
   Haverford College, near Philadelphia;
   and Pierre Noyes, professor at Stanford
   University.
</P>
<P>
   Sequoia Team
</P>
<P>
   This was their third meeting in a year,
   after two in California. The group calls
   itself the Sequoia Symposium, after the
   Cherokee chief who gave a written
   language to his people. (The scholars
   from diverse fields are trying to agree
   on a common "language.")
</P>
<P>
   I interviewed participants Friday and
   struggled to understand. Dennis said the
   group would have its first public panel
   Sunday and asked if I could put
   something in the paper about it.
</P>
<P>
   I didn't even know what to call it. She
   said it was about "spirituality,
   consciousness and quantum physics."
</P>
<P>
   I chuckled. Quantum physics?
</P>
<P>
   For some people, I thought, this might
   take a quantum leap.
</P>
<P>
   A notice of the meeting, described as
   Dennis suggested, appeared on an inside
   page of The World-Herald Saturday. I
   thought a handful of people might show
   up.
</P>
<P>
   Shocked at the turnout, I counted the
   crowd -150 is no exaggeration.
</P>
<P>
   We're all on a journey, all seeking
   meaning. And that, I think, is why this
   bright group of local people attended
   and asked penetrating questions.
</P>
<P>
   More on that in Thursday's column -
   along with a picture of the pattern
   Lynnclaire Dennis says she saw when she
   saw the light.

  Michael Kelly: Mind Journey With  Pattern

</P>
<P>
   As a child, Lynnclaire Dennis watched
   cartoons of Mr. Peabody and Sherman,
   wishing she could travel in their
   Wayback Machine.
</P>
<P>

   Time travel   [Image]<BR>
   was easy for  [Image]<BR>
   the   [Image]  [Image]<BR>
   intellectual   'The Pattern'<BR>
   pooch,    [Image]<BR>
   Peabody, and  [Image]<BR>
   his trusted
   boy: "Set the Wayback Machine, Sherman,
   for 1492."
</P>
<P>

   In real-time Sunday at the University of
   Nebraska at Omaha, Dennis, a divorced
   mother of two grown children, stood
   before 150 open-minded people, including
   philosophers, mathematicians and
   physicists.
</P>
<P>

   The scholars have formed the Sequoia
   Symposium, and met for four days at UNO
   to try to make sense of a vision Dennis
   had during a near-death experience.
</P>
<P>

   Tuesday's column told how Dennis passed
   out at 17,000 feet during a 1987 balloon
   race and had no vital signs. She was
   revived and endured a long recovery,
   eventually recalling in detail a
   holographic matrix of light.
</P>
<P>

   "The Pattern," as she calls it, has
   intrigued scholars - and, apparently, a
   number of Omaha-area people who attended
   a panel discussion Sunday.
</P>
<P>

   So what is the pattern?
</P>
<P>

   The leader of the discussion,
   philosopher Ashok Gangadean of Haverford
   College near Philadelphia, has written:
   "The Pattern expresses the living union
   of finite and infinite, of mind and
   matter, of space-time continuum."
</P>
<P>

   Wonderment
</P>
<P>

   Scholars hope that by understanding the
   pattern's intricate geometry, they can
   decode the basic structure of the
   universe.
</P>
<P>

   Sunday's gathering wasn't about science
   fiction or time travel - but certainly
   minds journeyed in wonderment.
   Participants must have pondered at times
   how little we really know, and whether
   Mr. Peabody's machine is altogether an
   impossibility.
</P>
<P>

   Nasseim Haramein, a researcher from
   Santa Cruz, Calif., who has studied the
   geometry of vacuums for 15 years, said:
   "Time is nonlinear."
</P>
<P>

   This was no Star Trek convention, but
   people discussed "wormholes" in the
   universe, the "curving" of time and the
   theory that every point in the universe
   is actually close to every other point.
</P>
<P>

   Louis Kauffman, mathematician and "knot
   theorist" from the University of
   Illinois-Chicago, joked that he hopes
   that's proved and harnessed - to cut
   down on his travel time from Chicago.
</P>
<P>

   Among the local people commenting or
   asking questions Sunday were a
   physician, a retired professor, a former
   Catholic priest, a psychotherapist and a
   woman studying witchcraft.
</P>
<P>

   A hospice worker was drawn to the
   meeting partly because she regularly
   comforts the dying, who say they see
   angels and people who have died before
   them.
</P>
<P>

   The Sequoia Symposium includes many
   scientists, but they say their
   discussion blends the scientific and the
   spiritual.
</P>
<P>

   Lynnclaire Dennis' pattern, one
   scientist said, represents a whirling
   dome of electromagnetic energy, with a
   whirling crystal in the center. Is it
   all just imagined? Or does it represent
   some kind of "overriding geometry" of
   the universe?
</P>
<P>

   Practical, Too
</P>
<P>

   Foster Gamble, a researcher from
   Woodside, Calif., said the meetings last
   weekend in Omaha were "one of the
   happiest times of my life."
</P>
<P>

   Among others, he sees practical
   applications. On Dennis' Web site,
   Gamble writes that the Sequoia Symposium
   foresees possibilities such as:
</P>
<P>

   [Image] Creating stronger building
   materials and structures with less
   consumption of resources.
</P>
<P>

   [Image] Achieving breakthroughs in the
   understanding of cellular and molecular
   structure, promoting healing and
   possibly preventing the formation of
   tumors.
</P>
<P>

   The optimistic group of deep thinkers
   even predicts better human relations in
   the next millennium.
</P>
<P>

   Gangadean, the philosopher, calls the
   work of the Sequoia Symposium historic
   and momentous - scientifically and
   spiritually.
</P>
<P>

   Participants, he said, are not only
   trying to clarify "the ultimate pattern,
   the missing fundamental logic," but also
   are discussing "the reality of heart,
   mind and soul."
</P>
<P>

   The Sequoia folks aren't mystics. Maybe
   they're on to something and maybe
   they're not.
</P>
<P>

   But their search for a grand unified
   theory of the universe represents an
   attempt to raise us all to a new level -
   to a higher meeting of the minds.
</P>
