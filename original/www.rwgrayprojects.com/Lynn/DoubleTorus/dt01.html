<H1 ALIGN=center>Double Torus Knot</H1>

<p>
Recall the (2, 3) torus knot, which Lynnclaire Dennis calls the "Mereon Knot".
</p>


<div align="center">

<p>
The knot goes around the torus surface 3 times while threading through 
the center torus hole 2 times.
</p>

<p>
This knot also fits on a double torus (a torus with 2 holes.)
</p>

<p>
Is this the minimum knot that can be defined on a double torus?
</p>


<p>
Here is the "simplest" Trefoil knot.  It is a (3, 2) torus knot, meaning that the knot
thread goes around the torus 2 times and threads through the torus hole 3 times.
</p>

</div>

<p>
However, note that this also fits on a triple-torus (a torus with 3 holes.)  
</p>

<p>
Consider a sphere. It has no hole through it.  No Knot can be formed on the surface of 
a sphere (without crossing over itself) except for the trivial unknot (ring).
</p>

<p>
Next, consider the sphere being dimpled and then a hole appears.  This forms the simple
torus.
</p>

<p>
We consider the restriction <u>Rule 1</u>: 
 <i>
  Only one strand segment of a knot is allowed to pass through a hole.
 </i> 
</p>

<p>
 Applying this rule we find that we can only form the unknot
with only the one hole of the torus.  The knot is a simple ring.
</p>

<p>
Next we introduce 2 holes through the original sphere to form the double torus. 
</p>

<p>
As shown above, the (2,3) knot, the "Mereon knot" is a knot which fits on this surface and
which satisfies Rule 1 above.
</p>

<p>
Aside from the unknot, is the (2, 3) knot the only one that can be formed on this surface
with the restriction of Rule 1?
</p>

<p>
Introducing 3 holes through the original sphere, and looking at knots which can be formed
on the resulting 3-hole "torus", we find that the (3, 2) "simplest" Trefoil knot fits
onto this surface.
</p>

<P>
The (2, 3) Mereon knot and the unknot also fit this surface while satifying 
Rule 1.
</p>

<p>
From the above consideration, it would appear that the (2, 3) Mereon knot is actually 
"simplier" than the (3, 2) Trefoil knot, requiring less holes through a sphere for its
formation.
</p>

<p>
The question to ask is then: Is there any physical reason to consider Rule #1 to be 
anything other than an arbitrary constraint?
