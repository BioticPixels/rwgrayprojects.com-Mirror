      <P>A Message from The Pattern's Midwife:</B> 
      <DD>For almost a decade I've been sharing the story of The Pattern with 
      anyone who would listen, illustrating The Pattern with sketches that are, 
      at best, kindergarten art. Suffice it to say, attempting to draw what I 
      see so clearly in my mind's eye while working with leading scientists, 
      educators, and researchers has been a humbling experience.
      <P></P>
      <DD>So it is, that those who have worked with me for years and individuals 
      new to this geo-matrix will fully understand my deep gratitude to Bob 
      Gray, mathematician/physicist and recognized expert in the geometry of 
      Buckminster Fuller. In addition to other significant contributions as a 
      member of the Sequoia team, Bob created the magnificent storyboard 
      graphics and the animation of The Pattern you are about to see. 
      <P></P>
      <DD>In November 1999, Bob continued his labor of love by taking a nosedive 
      into my head in order to create in 3D what I have described all these 
      years and can still see very clearly. What he estimated as a two week 
      project turned into a three month (and counting) exhilarating and 
      exhausting quest! Believe me, Bob now has a deep appreciation of what my 
      thirteen year journey has been for me. 
      <P>As a scientist and researcher, Bob's sole focus was to graphically map 
      the geometrical connection that I see bridge the 144 hyper-diamond 
      octahedron and the 120 faceted Icosahedral bubble. This would be the first 
      step toward a more complete understanding of the mathematics of the 
      "language of knotted light" we call The Pattern. We were persuaded that 
      this step was imperative in order to engage other researchers in the 
      adventure and unfold the implications and understand possible physical 
      applications of The Pattern. 
      <P>So welcome to the quest! We are excited to share this work with you and 
      look forward to hearing your thoughts and responses to this evolving work. 
      As you encounter The Pattern please consider the following: 
      <P>Most of us have been looking for answers to our questions: Who am I? 
      Why am I here? Does my life mean something? Can I make a difference? Why 
      do I feel so different? You now have The Answer: YOU are the Answer. 
      <P>Before proceeding, there is one remaining question you must answer: 
      <BR>Are you willing to stop living the Question, repeating your story that 
      has left you riddled with doubt and unresolved despair and <U>be</U> The 
      Answer? <BR>Answer "Yes" and your world will change.

            soon define itself as a, 144 polyhedron, which I describe as

            contact, a tone is emitted that sounds like two different tuning 
            forks have been struck together. The 144 hyper-diamond closes at its 
            "North." Just as when two rocks are struck together, this contact 
            causes an imploding spark. As the spark rolls inward it ignites the 
            pent up energy that grew during its formation. The "bottom/inner" 
            object completes its formation ("closes") into the 144 polyhedron.

            a solid "earth," the 144 Polyhedra. It is important to notice that 
            only when there is sound, does the intentionality of being -- 
            Light/The Pattern -- begin to come into full existence.
