<H1 ALIGN=center>The "New Cosmic Hierarchy"</H1>

<HR>

<P>
The purpose of the model is to show the polyhedral
relationships which R. B. Fuller describes in his
book 
<A HREF="../../synergetics/synergetics.html">
Synergetics
</A>
as well as the polyhedra and "Pattern Knot" 
<A HREF="../Lynn01.html">
Lynnclaire Dennis 
</A>
saw during her "near" death experiences.
</P>

<P>
There are several projects underway investigating the
possibility of applications of this geometry particularly
as it applies to electrical (and other?) energy generation. 
(I'll have more to say about physics applications below.)
Some of these researchers have developed similar 
(centainly related) geometric models.
</P>

<P>
But let's first enumerate the polyhedra in this part of
the model....
</P>

<HR>

<DIV ALIGN="center">
<IMG SRC="image02.jpg">
</DIV>

<P>
The polyhedra in this part of the model are
<UL>
  <LI>Tetrahedron (smallest in white)
  <LI>Octahedron (smallest in white, others in yellow)
  <LI>Cubeoctahedron (red)
  <LI>Cube (pink)
  <LI>Rhombic Dodecahedron (light green)
  <LI>144 triangular faced, concave-convex polyhedron
      (purple, yellow, pink and light green edges) 
</UL>
</P>

<P>
Lynnclaire describes the 144 polyhedron from her
experiences.  
</P>

<P>
Some of the interesting properties of this model are that:
<UL>
  <LI>All the (x, y, z) coordinates of all the 
      vertices (<B><I>all</I></B> the lattice points) 
      are integers only.
  <LI>All the volumes of all these polyhedra are
      integer valued. (This occurs when the volume
      of the smallest tetrahedron is <B><I>defined</I></B>  
      to be one unit of volume.
</UL>
</P>

<P>
The outer knot is one of the most interesting knots 
in that it defines (or is defined by) several of these
polyhedra.  I have shown 
<A HREF="../tetrap/tetrap.html">
on other web pages
</A>
how this particular Knot is related to the 
tetrahedron and the octahedron.  
</P>

<P>
When this knot is
made using a small number of straight sticks 
with flexible joints, I have shown that it can
be mapped onto a cube, onto the cubeoctahedron and 
within the icosahedron.  See, for example, 
<A HREF="../pve/pve.html">
this web page.
</A> 
</P>

<P>
With all these relations to the polyhedra, I feel that
it is very important to include this knot into the model.
</P>

<P>
<A HREF="http://www.math.uic.edu/~kauffman/">
Prof. Lou Kauffman
</A> 
has also been working with this and other knots.
</P>

<P>
Lynnclaire Dennis introduced me to this knot. She 
experienced this knot as a very dynamic entanglement of 
energy/light.  
</P>

<P>
There is a lot more that could be said about this 
knot.  Please see the above references/linked 
web pages as well as 
<A HREF="http://www.pattern.org/">
Lynnclaire's web page. 
</A>
</P>

<P>
Let us count the number of BB's (lattice points)
in this model....
</P>

<P>
This model was made from closest sphere packing.  It
has one sphere in the center.  Then 12 spheres
surround this one sphere.  Then 42 spheres are added. 
And then another layer of 92 spheres
is added.  The general formula (which I learned from
Fuller's 
<A HREF="../../synergetics/synergetics.html">
Syneregtics 
</A>)
is <NOBR>N<SUB>s</SUB> = 10F<SUP>2</SUP>+2.</NOBR> 
</P>

<P>
So, the bases for this model is a 3-frequency 
Cubeoctahedron (which Fuller calls a Vector Equilibrium
or just VE).
</P>

<P>
But this model is not a 3-frequency VE.  We take away 
12 spheres
from the 3-frequency VE, one at each of its 12 vertices.
(For more details on this aspect of the model, please 
see this 
<A HREF="../cp144poly/L144cp.html">
related web page
</A>
where I show this development with pictures.
)
</P>

<P>
Then, in order to complete the outermost Octahedron (yellow)
we need to add 6 sphere.
</P>

<P>
Summing this all together we have
</P>
<P ALIGN="center">
1 + 12 + 42 + 92 - 12 + 6 = 141
</P>

<P>
Lynnclaire's description of the dynamics of the 
144 polyhedron includes energy/light emerging
from 48 vertices in groups of 6 (8 groups of 6).
Looking at the polyhedron model above and on the
previous web page, we can clearly see 8 groups of 
7 vertices, which is 6 vertices around 1.  Maybe
there is some energy phenomenon which we can tap
into, if this model relates to anything physical.
</P>

<P>
As I mentioned previous, there are other researchers
using similar geometry considerations in their energy
research.  But, as far as I know, not in exactly the same
way as I am about to describe.
</P>

<P>
Looking for a possible relation between the 
polyhedron model and some physics,
I consulted a chart of the nuclides to see if there
are any stable nuclides with 141 nucleons.  (I am
well aware of the 
<A HREF="http://www.res.kutc.kansai-u.ac.jp/fcc/index2.html">
nuclear model of Prof. N. D. Cook
</A>
who uses a FCC (Face Centered Cubic)
(isotropic vector matrix, according to R.B.Fuller)
lattice model of the nucleus.  So considering the above
model as the nucleus of some atom is not all that 
"far out" to me.)  
</P>

<P>WARNING: The next paragraph is very speculative
and most likely wrong.  But sometimes its just fun
to let your imagination run wild....
</P>

<P>
I find that Praseodymium (Pr) is a stable nucleus 
with 59 protons and 83 neutrons (59+82=141).  I don't
know much about Praseodymium.  Could be interesting to 
look into.  In particular, it would be interesting to
learn if atoms of Praseodymium occur in a FCC lattice.
This would mean that we would have and FCC latice 
in the nucleus and an FCC lattice at the moleculer
level.  Then, it might be interesting to try to 
get the two levels to line up or couple or 
resonate in some way.  Maybe Lynnclaire's energy emergence
from 48 vertices of the model is a vacuum energy
pump that the "zero point energy" folks have been 
looking for.  The nucleus would pass the energy 
up one level to the atomic level and then at the
atomic level, being of the same geometry (maybe)
the energy would get past up another level to where
we can tap into it.
<P>

<P>
Anyway, not knowing much about Praseodymium (but I will
in another day or so), I started looking at other 
possiblities....
</P>  

<P>
If we were to truncate the model (remove the
vertices furthest from the center) we would be subtracting
6 vertices, one from each of the outer most octahedron's
6 vertices. This leaves 141-6=135.      
</P>

<P>
Again, considering the 135 as nucleons, I find that
this corresponds to ....  <B><I>Barium</I></B>!  (It
might correspond to other nucleons as well.)
</P>

<P>
Barium has an interesting/odd relation with the
UFO and free energy folks. It is rumored that several
people have built free energy and anti-gravity devices
using Barium.  Floyd Sweet is rumored to have used
Barium Ferrite magnetics in some of his devices.   
</P>
<P>
Barium Ferrite magnets are no longer manufactured in the
U.S.A.  The conspiracy folks seem to think this is 
because of its use in free energy and antigravity 
devices.  I have called several magnet manufacturing
companies as well as a U.S. customs import agent.  They
tell me that Barium Ferrite is no longer manufactured
in the U.S.A. because of the hazardous waste by-product
produced during the manufacturing of the magnets.  
Barium Ferrite magnets are available from other 
countries and you can import them. (I have.)
</P>

<P>
Barium Ferrite has a BCC lattice structure, which is very
close to a FCC structure.
</P>

<P>
Barium ...
</P>

<P>
Wait a minute....
</P>

<P>
I <B><I>just</I></B> looked up Praseodymium in a book
I have on my desk: "Handbook of the Elements" by Samuel
Ruben.  I was looking up Barium (for reasons I'll 
explain in a moment) when I woke up a little and realized
I could turn to Praseodymium and find out if it
occurs with a FCC crystal structure.     
</P>

<P>
<B>Its <I>close</I>!</B>  The crystal structure of
Praseodymium is "Hexagonal, close packed."
This is related to FCC, but not exactly the same thing.
In FCC, there are 12 atoms around 1 atom.  
This is the case for "Hexagonal, close packed"
as well: 12 around 1.  
</P>
<P>If you consider the 
12 around 1, we have 3 on top, 6 around one in the
middle, and 3 atoms on the bottom.  
</P>
<P>
Now, for FCC the 3 on the top do not line up with
the 3 on the botom.  They are not directly over
each other.
This is refered to as "ABCABC..."
layering sequence.
</P>
<P>
For Hexagonal close packed, the 3 atoms on top
do line up (are directly over) the 3 atoms on the
bottom.  The is refered to as "ABAB..." layering
sequence.
</P>

<P>
The difference is a 60 degree rotation.
</p>

<P>
I just checked my Goodfellow catalog of metals.  They
sell Praseodymium.  A rod 6.35mm diameter and 50mm
in length, cast, costs $303, (99.9% purity.)  
(This is not a single crystal.  I wonder if crystals
of any significant size can be obtained.  This material
oxidizes rather easily, so not easy to handle.)
</P>

<P>
Back to Barium,  I was trying to remember some 
details about Barium Titanite which is a peizoelectric crystal.
I know of some people that claim to have obtined 
"over unity" energy output using peizoelectric crystals.
</P>

<P>
Interesting... But will any of this lead
to anything useful?
</P>
