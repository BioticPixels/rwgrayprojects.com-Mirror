  <title>Jitterbug Vertex Motion</title>

<h1 align="center">Jitterbug Vertex Motion Angle Accounting</h1>

<p>
Here is a bit of interesting information about the Jitterbug motion.
</p>

<P>
Consider a single Jitterbug.  
</P>

<table align="center" border="1">
 <tr>
  <td>
   <img src="print0.jpg">
  </td>
 </tr>
 <tr>
  <td align="center">
   <a href="movie/jb01.html">Click For Movie</a>
  </td>
 </tr> 
</table>

<p>
In this illustration, I show the 3 x (blue), y (white), and z (purple) axes. 
Plus one of the axes (green) about which one of the Jitterbug triangular faces
will rotate (and slide along).
</p>

<p>
Now,also shown are 6 rings (red) used here only to represent a plane.
</P>

<p>
Consider the vertex sphere at the on the y (white) axis.
As the Jitterbug does it thing, this vertex sphere will split into 2 vertex spheres.
One of these 2 vertex spheres will rotate in the plane toward the x (blue) axis.
</p>


<table align="center" border="1">
 <tr>
  <td>
   <img src="print3.jpg">
  </td>
 </tr>
 <tr>
  <td align="center">
   vertex splits into 2.
  </td>
 </tr> 
</table>


<p>
Following this vertex sphere, you will see that it is always moving in the
plane shown by the 6 red rings.  
</p>


<table align="center" border="1">
 <tr>
  <td>
   <img src="print30.jpg">
  </td>
  <td>
   <img src="print54.jpg">
  </td>
 </tr>
 <tr>
  <td align="center" colspan="2">
   Vertex moves in the red ring plane to the x (blue) axis.
  </td>
 </tr> 
</table>



<table align="center" border="1">
 <tr>
  <td>
   <img src="print0.jpg">
  </td>
 </tr>
 <tr>
  <td align="center">
   Final position, same as start position.
  </td>
 </tr> 
</table>

<p>
The vertex moves from the y axis to the x axis, always in the red ring plane.
</P>
<p>
This is a total of 90 degrees. X-axis to Y-axis = 90 degree rotation.
</p>

<br>
<hr>
</br>

<p>
Now consider the same motion but from the point of view of the triangle's
rotation axis (green).
</p>

<p>
Watching the triangle motion about the rotation (green) axis, you will see
that as the triangle rotates from the initial Octahedron position, through
the open position (of the VE) and back to an Octahedron (closed) position
the triangle actually rotate by 120 degrees.
</p>




<table align="center" border="1">
 <tr>
  <td>
   <img src="print30b.jpg">
  </td>
 </tr>
 <tr>
  <td align="center">
   Rotation about green axis (60 degrees).
  </td>
 </tr> 
</table>

<br>

<table align="center" border="1">
 <tr>
  <td>
   <img src="print0b.jpg">
  </td>
 </tr>
 <tr>
  <td align="center">
   Rotation about green axis (120 degrees).
  </td>
 </tr> 
</table>

<p>
Of course, we did nothing different than we did in the first case.
</P>

<p>
<B><I>Except</i></b>  to change the axis about which we measured the rotation 
angle.
</p>

<p>
In the 1st case, <i>it looked like</i> we rotated the vertex sphere 
about the z (purple) axis, by an angular amount of 90 degrees. 
</p>
<p>
But what is really happening is a rotation of the trianlge about the green 
axis by an angular amount of 120 degrees. (We seem to have lost 30 degrees!)
</P>

<P>
Both cases are "real".  Both physically happen.
</P>

<p>
It all depends on your reference point.
</P>

<p>
This makes me wonder about the Quantum Mechanic treatment of spin 1/2 particles in 
which applying a 360 degree rotation operator to the spin 1/2 particle's
wave function
only changes the wave function by 180 degrees. Is this a rotation axis reference  
illusion as above?  Might there not be another axis (maybe in a higher dimension?)
about which the particle is really rotating (green axis) but we are only experiencing
the red ring plane motion rotating about the 
z (purple) axis?
