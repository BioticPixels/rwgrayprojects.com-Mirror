<H1 ALIGN=center>The Pattern Generates The Duo-Tetrahedron</H1>

<HR>
<P>
We show in the 
<A HREF="../torusm01/tm01.html">
pattern on a torus movies
</A>
that the 
pattern can pass through itself.  This is also mentioned
in the section showing the 
<A HREF="../breath/breath.html">
pattern "breathing".
</A>
</P>

<P>
The important point here is that when the pattern passes through
itself, it changes its orientaion by 90 degrees.  This is 
shown in the following two "snap shots" from the 
<A HREF="../breath/breath.html">
pattern breathing movies.
</A>
</P>

<P>
In the section on the 
<A HREF="../tetrap/tetrap.html">
construction of the pattern on a tetrahedron 
</A>
I showed that the pattern, when fully opened, fits exactly
onto the 4 faces of a tetrahedron. 
</P>

<P>
Now we will put two tetrahedron together with one 
tetrahedron rotated by 90 degrees.

<P>
You can see that by its "breathing" motion (and limits),  
Lynnclaire's knot pattern, 
<UL>
<LI>defines a torus,
<LI>defines a tetrahedron,
<LI>defines the tetrahedron's daul (another tetrahedron),
<LI>defines an octahedron (the intersection of the 2 tetrahedra)
<LI>and defines a cube.
</UL>
Its stagering to see so much geometry emerging from the 
consideration of a single knot!!
</P>
<P>
One starts to wonder what dosen't this knot define!
