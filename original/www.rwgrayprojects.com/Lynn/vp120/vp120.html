  <title>Vesica Pisces in intersecting 120 Poly</title>

  <h1 align="center">The Vesica Pisces and Interseting 120 Polyhedra</h1>

<p>
Consider 2 intersecting 120 Polyhedra.
</p>

<table border="1" align="center">
 <tr>
  <td>
   <img src="capture1.jpg">
  </td>
 </tr>
 <tr>
  <td align="center">
    2 Intersection 120 Polyhedra
  </td>
 </tr>
</table> 

<p>
The intersection is such that all the vertices at the interescting plane "A" match and such
that a vertex of one of the 120 Polyhedra is at the center of volume of the other 
120 Polyhedron ("B" and "C").
</p>

<table border="1" align="center">
 <tr>
  <td>
   <img src="capture1B.jpg">
  </td>
 </tr>
 <tr>
  <td align="center">
    Vertices Match Just Right
  </td>
 </tr>
</table> 



<p>
We can rotate the image a little bit and trace out the resulting Vesica Pisces. 
</p>

<table border="1" align="center">
 <tr>
  <td>
   <img src="capture2.jpg">
  </td>
 </tr>
 <tr>
  <td align="center">
    Vesica Pisces in Intersecting 120 Poly
  </td>
 </tr>
</table> 


<p>
Actually, there are 2 Vesica Pisces at 90&deg; to each other.
</p>

<table border="1" align="center">
 <tr>
  <td>
   <img src="capture3.jpg">
  </td>
 </tr>
 <tr>
  <td align="center">
    2 Vesica Pisces in Intersecting 120 Poly
  </td>
 </tr>
</table> 


<p>
This is all a result of the 120 Polyhedra being constructed from Octahedra.
</p>


<table border="1" align="center">
 <tr>
  <td>
   <img src="capture4.jpg">
  </td>
 </tr>
 <tr>
  <td align="center">
    Intersecting Octahedra in Vesica Pisces position
  </td>
 </tr>
</table> 


<p>
Note that the part of the V.P. circle inside the other circle spans 120&deg;.  
</p>


<table border="1" align="center">
 <tr>
  <td>
   <img src="angle.jpg">
  </td>
 </tr>
 <tr>
  <td align="center">
    Arc measurement inside V.P.
  </td>
 </tr>
</table> 


<p>
If, for some reason, we can subtract this part of the whole circle we are left with
a 240&deg; arc. For a V.P., there are 2 circles.  From each we remove the 2 inner arcs of
120&deg;.
</p>

<table border="1" align="center">
 <tr>
  <td>
   <img src="angle2.jpg">
  </td>
 </tr>
 <tr>
  <td align="center">
    Inner Arcs removed from V.P.
  </td>
 </tr>
</table> 


<p>
But we just showed there are 2 Vesica Pisces in the intersecting 120 Polyhedron. 
</p>

<p>
So we have 4 arcs of 240&deg; each.   
</p>

<p>
But this is just a description of the Pattern Knot.
</P>

<p>
See <a href="../tetrap/tetrap.html">
Constructing The Pattern From A Tetrahedron
</a> in which I showed the construction of the Pattern knot from 4 circles drawn
on the 4 faces of a Tetrahedron.  For each circle, an arc of 120&deg; is removed.
</P>

<hr>

<p>
I had hoped that these thoughts on the Vesica Pisces in the 120 Polyhedron might lead to 
a new way to construct the Pattern knot, but I don't see how.
</p>

<p>
I also thought this was all new, but I find that I did something similar sometime ago
with the 144 Polyhedron. 
See a 
<a href="../vp144/vp144.html">
Note
</a>
I wrote to Lynnclaire some time ago.
