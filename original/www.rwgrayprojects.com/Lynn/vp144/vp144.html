<P>
  Lynnclaire,  You mentioned the possibility of 2 144 Polyhedra 
coming together to form a V.P.  This is possible.

<P>
  The 144 Poly model I made shows that you can take a cube and on each of
the 6 faces, you can add a "cap".  So, there is a cube in every 144.
<P>
  The distance from the center of a square face to the top of a cap is the
same distance from the cube's center of volume to a cube's face center.
<p>
  This means that is you take 2 of the 144's, each with a cube in them, and 
bring them together so that 2 cube faces touch, then you have the 2 144's 
interpenetrating each other.  The interpenetration is exactly the same
as for 2 spheres interpenetrating to define the V.P.  That is, each sphere 
surface passes throught the center of volume of the other sphere.
<p> 
 Here are some images:
