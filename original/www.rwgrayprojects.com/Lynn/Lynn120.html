<H1 ALIGN=center>The 120 Polyhedron</H1>

<HR>

<P>
The outer polyhedron is said to have 120 faces.  This is another 
interesting number because the icosahedron will generate 120 LCD
spherical triangles, covering the entire sphere.  So, maybe the 
outer polyhedron corresponds with the polyhedron defined by the
120 LCD triangles of the Icosahedron. 
</P>



<P>
Here is a "template" drawing from which you can assemble the 48
LCD polyhedron.
</P>

<P>
My interpretation of what Lynnclaire has told me is
that she saw a polyhedron inside another polyhedron.  The inner
most polyhedron had 48 cones of light coming out of it at 48 
vertices.  This polyhedron had 144 triangular faces.
The outer polyhedron had 120 triangular faces.
</P>

<P>
From 
<A HREF="../rbfnotes/notes.html">my work on R. Buckminster Fuller's geometry,</A>
I was able to 
point out that there are 48 LCD (Lowest Common Denominator) triangles
covering the entire sphere and defined by the great
circles of symmetry of the V.E. (cuboctahedron). 
So, we place a light cone in each of the 48 LCD triangles.
</P>

<P>
Next, we add a tetrahedron (not regular) onto each of the 48
LCD triangles.  This results in 3 triangular faces for every LCD
triangle.  This gives 3 x 48 = 144 triangles for the resulting 
polyhedron.

<P>
So, the resulting "inner" polyhedron has 144 triangular faces, 
62 vertices (48 of the vertices have light cones coming out of them), 
and 204 edges.
</P>

<P>
Here are some images of the 48 cones.
