 <h1 align="center">More Dodecahedron Scaling and Packing</h1>

<p>
We define the scale of the 1st regular Dodecahedron to be 1 = p^0.
</p>



 <table border="1" align="center">
   <tr>
    <td>
     <img src="iind01.jpg">
    </td>
   </tr>
   <tr>
    <td align="center">
     First Dodecahedron with first Icosahedron inside.
    </td> 
   </tr>
  </table>

<p>
Within the Dodecahedron is an Icosahedron.  Its scale is also defined to be 1.  It 
is sized with respect to the Dodecahedron as described in the article on the
<a href="../Icosa/IcosaScaling.html">
scaling of the Icosahedron.</a>
<p>

<p>
We next add a scaled Icosahedron around the regular Dodecahedron.
</p>



 <table border="1" align="center">
   <tr>
    <td>
     <img src="print0.jpg">
    </td>
   </tr>
   <tr>
    <td align="center">
     A scaled Icosahedron <br> around the Dodecahedron.
    </td> 
   </tr>
  </table>

<p>
The scale of this Icosahedron is such that an additional regular Dodecahedron 
can be added to a face of the Icosahedron and such that: 1) The added Dodecahedron shares a 
vertex with the orginal Dodecahderon and 2) 3 other vertices of the added 
Dodecahedron share 3 vertices of the scaled Icosahedron.  (This is 
a little hard to see....)
</p>



 <table border="1" align="center">
   <tr>
    <td>
     <img src="print1.jpg">
    </td>
   </tr>
   <tr>
    <td align="center">
     Scaled Icosahedron with an <br> additional scaled Dodecahedron.
    </td> 
   </tr>
  </table>

<p>
There are 20 triangular faces to the Icosahedron.  Each of the 20 faces could be 
given a regular Dodecahedron, but it would be very hard to see some details, so I'll
only add 4 more Dodecahedron, for a total of 5, clustered around a single
Icosahedron vertex.
</p>


 <table border="1" align="center">
   <tr>
    <td>
     <img src="print3.jpg">
    </td>
   </tr>
   <tr>
    <td align="center">
     5 Dodecahedron around 1 Icosahedron vertex.
    </td> 
   </tr>
  </table>


<p>
Changing color helps a little.
</p>



 <table border="1" align="center">
   <tr>
    <td>
     <img src="print4.jpg">
    </td>
   </tr>
   <tr>
    <td align="center">
     5 Dodecahedron around 1 Icosahedron vertex.
    </td> 
   </tr>
  </table>




 <table border="1" align="center">
   <tr>
    <td>
     <img src="print5.jpg">
    </td>
   </tr>
   <tr>
    <td align="center">
     5 Dodecahedron around 1 Icosahedron vertex.
    </td> 
   </tr>
  </table>


<p>
These 5 regular Dodecahedra actually define a plane.  This plane can be used to 
define the next scale for a larger Dodecahedron.
</p>



 <table border="1" align="center">
   <tr>
    <td>
     <img src="print10.jpg">
    </td>
   </tr>
   <tr>
    <td align="center">
     The next scaled regular Dodecahedron.
    </td> 
   </tr>
  </table>


 <table border="1" align="center">
   <tr>
    <td>
     <img src="print9.jpg">
    </td>
   </tr>
   <tr>
    <td align="center">
      The next scaled regular Dodecahedron.
    </td> 
   </tr>
  </table>


<p>
Back to the 5 "connection" Dodecahedra, we find that if we display them as
solid polyhedra, there appears a dimple in the center.  
</p>


 <table border="1" align="center">
   <tr>
    <td>
     <img src="print6.jpg">
    </td>
   </tr>
   <tr>
    <td align="center">
     A dimple between the 5 Dodecahedra.
    </td> 
   </tr>
  </table>

<p>
This dimple has the shape of an Icosahedron.
</p>



 <table border="1" align="center">
   <tr>
    <td>
     <img src="print7.jpg">
    </td>
   </tr>
   <tr>
    <td align="center">
     Icosahedron in "dimple".
    </td> 
   </tr>
  </table>

<p>
This dimple associated Icosahedron makes contact with the Icosahedron 
around the 1st Dodecahedron.
</p>

 <table border="1" align="center">
   <tr>
    <td>
     <img src="print8.jpg">
    </td>
   </tr>
   <tr>
    <td align="center">
     An Icosahedron in the dimple defined
     <br> by the 5 connection Dodecahedra.
    </td> 
   </tr>
  </table>


<p>
The scaling of these Dodecahedra is as follows:
</p>

<p>
The "connection" Dodecahedra have a scale factor of p^1, and they connect the 
1st Dodecahedron to the next layed (surrounding) Dodecahedron.  
</p>

<p>
The outer surrounding (2nd layer) Dodecahedron has a scale factor of p^3.
</p>

<p>
The Icosahedron within the 1st Dodecahedron is defined to have a scale 
factor of 1.
<p>

<p>
The Icosahedron in the next (Icosahedron) layer out, used to define the 
"connection" Dodecahedra scale, has a scale factor of p^3.
</p>

<p>
The small "dimple" Icosahedron has a scale fator of p^2.
</P>

<p>
Note that the connecting dodecahedra interpenatrate each other. 
The shape of this interpenatration needs to be explored.
</p>
