<H1>A Natural Construction For The Dimpled 120 Polyhedron</H1>

<BIG>
<P>
I here show a way to construct the 120 Polyhedron and
I show how the "dimpled" aspect of the 120 Poly comes
about in a "natural" way. 
</P>

<P>
First, consider the cube and the octahedron.  They are
dauls of each other.  Here are some pictures.
</P>

  <IMG SRC="sco02.gif">
</DIV>

<P>
Notice that I picked the relative size of the cube and 
the octahedron so that their edges intersect each other.  
This can be used to define the Rhombic Dodecahedron. However,
we are not going to need the Rhombic Dodecahedron
for what I am trying to show.  I show it here in order
to demonstrate how duals can define another polyhedron. 
</P>

</DIV>


<P>
Next, consider the Icosahedron and the Regular Dodecahedron.
They are duals of each other.  And we again pick the 
relative size for each polyhedron such that their 
edges intersect each other.
</P>

<DIV ALIGN="center">
  <IMG SRC="id01.gif">
  <IMG SRC="id02.gif">
  <BR>
  <IMG SRC="id04.gif">
  <IMG SRC="id03.gif">
</DIV>

<P>
We now use the Icosahedron and Regular Dodecahedron
to define the Tricontahedron. (This is simalar to the
construction of the Rhombic Dodecahedron from the
Cube and the Octahedron above.) 
</P>

<DIV ALIGN="center">
  <IMG SRC="rt01.gif">
  <IMG SRC="rt02.gif">
</DIV>

<P>
Now, it is perhaps not well known, but the cube "fits"
into the Regular Dodecahedron exactly.  That is, for
the correct size and orientation, the cube and the 
Regular Dodecahedron share the same 8 vertices.
</P>

<DIV ALIGN="center">
  <IMG SRC="docube01.gif">
  <IMG SRC="docube02.gif">
  <BR>
  <IMG SRC="docube03.gif">
  <IMG SRC="docube04.gif">
  <BR>
  <IMG SRC="docube05.gif">
</DIV>

<P>
This gives us a scale and orientation so that we can fit the
cube and the octahedron into the Icosahedron and the 
Regular Dodecahedron.  The results look like this:
</P>

<DIV ALIGN="center">
  <IMG SRC="img01.gif">
<BR>
  <IMG SRC="img30.gif">
</DIV>

<P>
Now, the tricontahedron has 30 diamond faces.  If 
we could somehow replace each diamond face with four
triangular faces, then the resulting polyhedron
would have <NOBR>30 x 4 = 120</NOBR> triangular faces.
</P>

<P>
Note that each of the diamond faces of the Tricontahedron
have a red and a blue line on them.  These lines intersect and
divide the diamond faces into 4 triangles. 
</P>

<P>
Next note that the green octahedron "sticks out"
through 6 (out of 30) of the diamond face centers of the 
Tricontahedron. If we imagine that <B><I>all</I></B> the diamond 
face centers 
are pushed radially outward to the Octahedron vertices,
we end up with a "dimpled" 120 polyhedron. 
</P>


<DIV ALIGN="center">
  <IMG SRC="p120.gif">
</DIV>

<P>
Here I have outlined 3 of the diamond faces.  The
diamond face centers are all "pushed out".
</P>

<DIV ALIGN="center">
  <IMG SRC="p1202.gif">
</DIV>

<P>
This new construction for the "dimpled" 120 polyhedron
seems more "natural" than the previous method.  The previous
construction failed to show or explain how the 
dimpling comes about.  We simply dimpled the 120 poly
because we were told to.  The degree of dimpling
was, therefore, always in question.  This 
construction shows how the dimpling comes
about as relations to all the other polyhedra involved.
