<H1 ALIGN=center>The Tree Of Life In 3D</H1>


<P>
I was reading Linda Moulton Howe's book Mysterious Lights and Crop Circles (a very good book)
and saw on page 80 a crop circle in the shape of the "The Kabbalistic Tree of Life".
</P>

<p>
I had seen this around before, but not being particularly interested in "mystical" things, I hadn't
really studied it in any detail.
</p>

<p>
(I don't have the crop circle image used in the book, but here is one from a different angle to 
that shown in the book. Sorry, I don't know who took this picture or I would give 
appropiate credit.)
</p>

<table ALIGN="center" border=1>
 <tr>
  <td> 
   <IMG SRC="tree01.gif">
  </td>
 </tr>
</table>

<p>
What struck me was that the "lower" 4 circles, in my eyes, represented a tetrahedron, a 3 dimensional
(3D) polyhedron.  This started me thinking that the rest of the Tree of Life may be a 
3 dimensional figure.
</p>

<table ALIGN="center" border=1>
 <tr>
  <td> 
   <IMG SRC="tree02.gif">
  </td>
 </tr>
</table>

<p>
Visually, there are other tetrahedra in the Tree of Life, but this is the one that got my attention
first.
</p>

<p>
I constructed the Tree of Life in a 3D computer program I wrote.  Here is the result.
</p>

<table ALIGN="center" border=1>
 <tr>
  <td> 
   <IMG SRC="tree03.jpg">
  </td>
 </tr>
</table>

<p>
This looks a little funny.  Mostly because of the perspective view used by the 3D program I used 
to create it.  So some blue spheres look bigger than other spheres even though they all have
the same diameter.
</p>

<p>
I created this by looking at various orientations of different lattices.  I first tried the FCC
(Face Centered Cubic) Lattice.  Then I tried the SC (Simple Cubic) Lattice. The simple cubic lattice
seemed to match very well.
</p>



<table ALIGN="center" border=1>
 <tr>
  <td> 
   <IMG SRC="tree04.jpg">
  </td>
 </tr>
</table>


<table ALIGN="center" border=1>
 <tr>
  <td> 
   <IMG SRC="tree05.jpg">
  </td>
 </tr>
</table>


<p>
Here it is from another point of view.
</p>


<table ALIGN="center" border=1>
 <tr>
  <td> 
   <IMG SRC="tree06.jpg">
  </td>
 </tr>
</table>

<p>
There are probably other ways that the Tree of Life can be constructed in 3D.
</p>

<p>
The way I have shown involves not only the simple cubic lattice (green lines) but also 2 different
FCC lattices.  This is because some of the red cylinders/edges of the Tree of Life
are the face diagonals of the (green) cubes. 
</p>

<p>
Other orientations and lattices are being investigated.
