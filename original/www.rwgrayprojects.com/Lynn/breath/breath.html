<H1 ALIGN=center>The Pattern Breathing</H1>

<HR>
<P>
Here are some GIF movies of the pattern "breathing".
</P>

<DIV ALIGN=center>

<P>
In the next movie, I have put a sphere in the center so you
can easily follow the motion. 
</P>

<P>
The above movie might be called a "half-cycle".  
The motion begins as a hoop, flexis open, 
closes back to a hoop and then repeats.
</P>
<P>
However, we know that the pattern can pass through itself.
(This is shown in my movie which shows the pattern evoluting
on a torus.  This was also discovered using a wire model at 
Sequoia meeting II.) So the following movie might be called
a "full-cycle".  
</P>

<DIV ALIGN=center>
<IMG SRC="breatha2.gif">
</DIV>

<P>
The pattern is seen opening into one
orientation, closing back into a hoop (at which point
it passes through itself) and then openning up
again <B><I>but in a differnt orientation.</I></B>  The
significance of this is explainned in the section called
<A HREF="../duotet/duotet.html">
"The pattern generates the duo-tetrahedron."  
</A>
</P>

<P>
Her are two other movies...
