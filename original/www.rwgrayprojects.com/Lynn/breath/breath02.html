<H1 ALIGN=center>Comments On The Breathing Motion</H1>

<HR>
<P>
Again, here is a GIF movie showing the pattern "breathing".
</P>

<DIV ALIGN=center>
<IMG SRC="breatha1.gif">
</DIV>

<P>
Note how the sphere in the center is expanding and contracting.
</P>
<P>
Although these images show the pattern in one fixed orientation,
it is assumed that "in reality" the pattern is always spinning
about.  The pattern would then define a sphere.  The sphere 
defined by the pattern would also expand and contract just as the
sphere in the center of the above movie expands and contracts.
</P>

<P>
The question to be answered then is: "What is the radius of the 
pattern defined spheres when the pattern is fully open and when
the pattern is in its 'closed' hoop (circle) position?"
</P>

<P>
There are (at least) two answer.  The first answer is for the
case that the overall length of the can change.  That is, if
a model of the pattern were made out of "wire" then the 
wire would stretch and contract as it is opened and closed.  The
second answer is for the case in which the pattern always has a
fixed total length.  That is, the "wire" can not stretch or
contract.
</P>

<H3>
1) The Total Length Changes:
</H3>

<P>
We constructed the pattern on the tetrahedron in 
<A HREF="../tetrap/tetrap.html">
another section.
</A>
Recall that we drew a circle inside each of the tetrahedron's 
4 trianglular faces.
</P>

<DIV ALIGN=center>
<IMG SRC="sr03.gif">
</DIV>

<P>
The radius of the circle is 
R<SUB>1</SUB> = 1/sqrt(3)E = 0.5773503 (approx.). 
("E" is the edge length
of the triangle around which the circle is drawn.) 
This is the radius 
of the "hoop" when the pattern is in its "closed" position.  
</P>

<P>
However, in the maxium open position, the 4 circles are 
drawn around an octahedron which also has an edge length
of E.  
</P>

<DIV ALIGN=center>
<IMG SRC="sr05.html">
</DIV>

<P>
The octahedron consists of 3 interesting squares.
the squares have an edge length of E.  So the
sphere defined by the octahedron (the pattern in its open position)
will have a radius of 
<BR>R<SUB>2</SUB> = 1/sqrt(2)E = 0.70710678 (approx.).
</P>

<DIV ALIGN=center>
<IMG SRC="sr04.gif">
</DIV>

<P>
So, the pattern defined spheres expand from 1/sqrt(3)E to 
1/sqrt(2)E.  That is, the ratio of contraction is sqrt(2)/sqrt(3) = 
0.8164966(approx.). 
</P>

<P>
We note that with the circumscribed sphere around a VE (cuboctahedron)
having a radius of E (edge length of the VE) then the inscribed
sphere which just touches the center of the 8 triangular faces of
the VE will have a radius of sqrt(2)/sqrt(3)E.  This is in the
same ratio as the pattern defined sphere's.  
</P>


<H3>
2) The Total Length Is Fixed:
</H3>

<P>
In this case, if we set the radius of the pattern to be 1
when in its closed form, then the radius of an arc when in 
the fully open position will be 
</P>
<P>
arc-ro = 9/8.
</P>

<P>
However, in the open position, the 4 arcs define an octahedron.
The distance from the octahedron's center of volume to a 
vertex (through which the pattern's arcs pass) is given by
</P>
<P>
sphere-ro = sqrt(3/2)(9/8),  (approx. 1.3778)
</P>

<P>
In this case, the closed shpere of radius 1 "opens" 
to a sphere of radius sqrt(3/2)(9/8),  (approx. 1.3778).
</P>

<P>
If the open sphere radius is defined to be 1 then the closed
sphere radius will be sqrt(2/3)(8/9), (approx. 0.7258).
</P>
