<P>
Lynnclaire reports that energy emerges from the 120 Polyhedron's Icosahedron type
vertices and returns into the 120 Polyhedron through the regular Dodecahedron
type vertices.  
This occurs when the 120 Polyhedron is deformed into an ellipsoid.
(See <a href="http://www.pattern.org/">the Pattern web site 
at http://www.pattern.org</a>
for more information on this deformation and other energy dynamics.) 
</P>

<P>
When considering the energy flow through the 120 Polyhedra, we should consider
the possibility of "vortex" like motion.  That is, rotational motion in or out
of the 120 Polyhedron.  This is the kind of motion we showed with the 
Jitterbugs above.
</P>

<P>
Recall that the regular Dodecahedron defined by 5 intersecting Tetrahedra 
also defined what appears to be either a clockwise or 
counter clockwise vortex through the 
Dodecahedron's 12 pentagonal faces.  The center of the Dodecahedron's faces
is aligned radially with the Icosahedron type vertices of the 120 Polyhedron.
</P>

</DIV>


<P>
Each face appears to have a vortex with the same rotational direction.
</P>

<P>
Notice that since there are 3 pentagonal faces around every regular Dodecahedron's
vertex, the vortex circular motions will be in conflict with each other.
</P>

<p>
Because of this conflict, it is not clear that vortices 
are ever actually realized through the 12 face centers of 
the regular Dodecahedron. 
</p>

<p>
If we consider the 5 intersecting Octahedra in the 120 Polyhedron as Jitterbugs, 
then we find that during the Jitterbug motion holes do appear at 
each Icosahedron type vertex.

The "vortex" holes at the Icosahedron's 12 vertices are

<p>
The other energy flow points that Lynnclaire describes, 
as mentioned above, occurs through the 
regular Dodecahedron's vertices.  As we have described before, the
vertices of the regular Dodecahedron coincide with the vertices
of 5 Cubes.  They are also radially inline with the Icosahedron face centers.
The rotation axes of the 5 Jitterbugs also coincide with the 20 vertices
of the Dodecahedron.

  </table> 


<P>
Each of the 5 Jitterbugs of the 120 Polyhedron has 8 triangular faces.  
In the closed position, a Jitterbug is an Octahedron.  The face center
of any of the Jitterbugs' faces is radially in line with the regular 
Dodecahedron's vertices.
</P>
<P>
If we define the domain of a "vortex" at each of the Dodecahedron's
vertices to be the cones with there apex at the center of volume
and such that the cone completely encircles the triangular face of 
a Jitterbug in the Octahedron position, then we see in the next figure 
that even for a single Jitterbug, the vortex domains overlap each other.

 </table> 

<P>
As we will see shortly, we can change the "open" angle of the 8 cones so that for 
a single Jitterbug the cones do not overlap each other.  But I wanted to start 
with the cones open to such a degree as to completely enclose the Jitterbug's 
triangles because with these cones the circular rims of the cones can be used to
trace out the knot pattern that Lynnclaire describes.

<p>
Actually, several different "Pattern" knots can be traced on the cone's rims.

<p>
Details about this knot can be found at Lynnclaire's web site 
<a href="http://www.pattern.org/">www.pattern.org</a> as well as my
web pages at 
<a HREF="../Lynn01.html">

</a>
</p>



<p>
We can lessen the open angle of the 8 cones so that the cones
do not overlap each other but are tangent to one another.
</P>

   <tr>
    <td align="center">
      <img src="images/cone35a.jpg">

       Figs. 7.21 <i>Cones Of Jitterbug Faces <br>Just Touch</i>
    </td>
   </tr>
 </table> 

<P>
Recall that the Jitterbug triangles rotate as they move radially.  The 
8 cones could rotate in the same directions as the Jitterbug triangles
rotate without any conflict. The cones would not interfere with one another.
This seems like a good choice for the domains of vortex-like motion.  
</P>
<P>
However, there are many Jitterbugs in the 120 Polyhedron. When we look at the 
5 Jitterbugs/Octahedra (4 rotated as described above) we see that the cones
do intersect one another.    
</P>

    </td>
  </table> 

<p>
Each "petal" of the intersecting cones is centered on one of the
120 Polyhedron's "diamonds" (a rhombic Triacontahedron's face.)
</p>

 <table border=1 align="center">
   <tr>
   <td align="center">
      <img src="images/jbcones4.jpg">
      <br>
      Fig. 7.25 <i>The 120 Polyhedron's 30 
       <br>"diamonds" in the cone's "petal" <br>domains</i>
    </td>
  </table> 


<p>
We can, of course, set the cone angle so that all 20 cones are tangent to 
one another.
</p>


 <table border=1 align="center">
   <tr>
   <td align="center">
      <img src="images/jbcones5.jpg">
      <br>
      Fig. 7.26 <i>Cones around<br>Dodecahedron's vertices</i>
    </td>
  </table> 

<P>
However, because there are three cones touching 
every cone, there is no way to assign a rotation direction to each 
cone without some conflict in direction. (See Fig. 7.2 above.) 
</P>


<P>
Each Jitterbug has 8 faces. With 5 Jitterbugs, this 
gives a total of 5x8=40 triangular faces.  Therefore, each of the 
Icosahedron's 20 
faces is covered by 2 Jitterbug faces.  It can be seen in the movies above 
that these
2 Jitterbug triangles per Icosahedron face (Dodecahedron vertex)
 rotate in opposite directions. 
This, again, raises the question as to whether
or not this Jitterbug motion, and vortices through the 
regular Dodecahedron's 20 vertices, are ever realized.
