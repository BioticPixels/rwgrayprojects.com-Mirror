<P>
The angle "alpha" through which the 4 cubes must rotate in 
order to define a regular Dodecahedron is given 
by the equation:
</P>
<DIV ALIGN=center>
sin(alpha/2) = sqrt(3/2) / (2 * p) 
</DIV>
<P>
where "p" is the Goldern ratio
</P>
<DIV align=center>
p = (1 + sqrt(5)) / 2
</DIV>

<P>
alpha approximately equals 44.47751219 degrees.
</P>

<P>
One half of this value is approximately 22.2387561 degrees. 
</P>

<P>
To derive angle alpha, I considered 3 vertices of the 
120 Polyhedron.
<ul>
<LI>v1 = (0, p, p^3)
<LI>v2 = (p^3, 0, P)
<LI>v3 = (p^2, -p^2, p^2)
</UL>
</P>
<P>
These vectors all have the same magnitude given by
</P>

<P>
mag = mag(v3) = sqrt(p^4 + p^4 + p^4) = sqrt(3)p^2
</P>

<P>
The dot product v2 and v1:
</P>
<P>
v1.v2 = mag(v1)mag(v2)cos(theta) = p^4
<BR>
(sqrt(3)p^2)(sqrt(3)p^2)cos(theta) = p^4
<BR>
cos(theta) = 1/3
<P>
The projection of v2 onto v1:
</P>
<P>
A = mag(v2)cos(theta) = (sqrt(3)p^2)/3 = p^2 / sqrt(3)
</P>
<P>
The vector A defined to be in the direction of v1 and of
length A can be defined as
<BR>
A = (0, p/3, (p^3/3))
</P>
<P>
Then the distance from A to v2 is 
<BR>
d = 2 sqrt(2/3) p^2
</P>
<P>
The distance from v2 to v3 is 
<BR>
mag(v2 - v1) = mag(p^2 - p^3, -p^2, p^2 - p)
<br>
which reduces to mag = 2p.
</P>
<P>
So we have a triangle with 2 sides equal to 
<BR>
d = 2 sqrt(2/3) p^2
<BR>
and one side equal to 
<BR>
mag = 2p
</P>
<P>
With this information, we find the angle alpha to be
<BR>
2 sqrt(2/3) p^2 sin(alpha / 2) = p
</P>
<P>
Solving for sin(alpha/2) we get
</P>

<DIV ALIGN=center>
sin(alpha/2) = sqrt(3/2) / (2 * p) 
</DIV>
