<P>
The other major polyhedron that Lynnclaire describes from her near death
experiences is a 144 triangular faced polyhedron.

<P>
It is interesting to note that the 144 Polyhedron is also based 
on the Cube-Octahedron dual pair.

<P>
The next illustration shows the 144 Polyhedron (red) with one of the Octahedron's
faces outlined in white and part of the cube face outlined in green.

<p>
In fact, this 144 Polyhedron can be constructed from the Face Centered Cubic (FCC)
lattice, which Fuller called the Isotropic Vector Matrix (IVM).  That is, 
all of the 144 Polyhedron's vertices coincide with FCC vertex points.

  </TR>  
 </table>

<p>
This also
means that this polyhedron can be constructed from the closest packing of 
spheres.
</P>

<P>
Recall that when we first introduced the 120 Polyhedron, 
we rotated 4 cubes, leaving a 5th cube stationary.  We then added the
5 Cube's duals: the Octahedron.  The 144 Polyhedron has only one
Cube-Octahedron dual pair.
</P>

<P>
What happens when we take 5 of these 144 Polyhedra and rotate 4 of them,
as we did with the cubes, by an angular amount of  44.47751219°(approximately)?
As before, we get 62-12=50 vertices of the 120 Polyhedron, the "missing"
12 vertices corresponding to the Icosahedron.  However, there are also 
120 additional external vertices from the 5 144 Polyhedra which do not 
coincide with any of the 120 Polyhedron's vertices.
The next illustration shows these additional vertices. 
</P>

   </TD>
  </TR>  
 </table>

<P>
In this illustration, the pink (polyhedron and spheres) mark the 120 Polyhedron.
The green marks the 5 144 Polyhedron, and the blue marks the vertices of the
regular Dodecahedron.
</P>
<p>
Since there are 10 green spheres within the regular Dodecahedron 
face region, and knowing that there are 12 Dodecahedron faces, there are then
12x10=120 vertices of the 144 Polyhedra showing through the 120 Polyhedron. 
</P> 

<P>
If we let the 4 144 Polyhedron continuously rotate, we get a movie in which
it appears that surface waves are moving over the 120 Polyhderon.
</P>

<P>
As with the 120 Polyhedron, the 144 clearly defines 9 planes
on which all the vertices occur.  The orientation for this 
counting of planes is the same as for the 120 Polyhedron.  That
is, the z-axis runs through opposite vertices of the Octahedron.  (Of 
course other planes are also defined by the model.)  Unlike the
120 Polyhedron case, each of the 9 planes are separated by an 
equal distance from its neighbor planes.

The distance between each plane, at the same scale as the 120 Polyhedron,

<P>
Earlier, I described how 5 Octahedra/Jitterbugs (4 of which are rotated
with respect to the 5th) play a part in the construction of the 120 Polyhedron.
It should be noted that the 5 rotated Octahedra <B><I>alone</I></B> defines
another, different 120 triangular
faced polyhedron.  The image below shows the 5 rotated Octahedra with 
a slightly different orientation and color scheme.  We can see
that around each vertex of the Octahedra are 4 triangles.  An Octahedron has
6 vertices.  Adding up all the triangular faces we get a total of 5x6x4=120.

<P>
It looks like there are again 30 diamond "bases" (outlined in white) 
as there is with the 
original 120 Polyhedron.  However, this is not the case because the diamond
base is not planer.  We can see this by looking at another diamond base.
The point "A" is not in the same plane as the other 
3 vertices of the "diamond".

We can construct 2 equilateral triangles by connecting the intersection

If we cut these 5 Jitterbugs in half and remove the front half, we can see
into the system.  We discover that during the Jitterbug motion a
truncated Icosahedron position occurs.  However, not all of the edges 
are of equal length.  This polyhedron has 12 regular
pentagons, 20 irregular hexagons and 60 vertices.
Molecules in this polyhedral 
configuration are call "Buckminsterfullerenes".

When we take an Octahedron, add in 5 intersecting Tetrahedra
and the regular Dodecahedron, we get the
following illustrations.

<P>
Lynnclaire reports that the 120 Polyhedron she experienced is
not a static polyhedron.  It "breaths" or expands into an 
ellipsoid shape.  Could it be that the ellipsoid she experienced is the Golden
Ellipsoid having its axes in the Golden Ratio?
