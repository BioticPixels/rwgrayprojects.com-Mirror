<P>

In June of 1998 
<a href="http://www.pattern.org/">
Lynnclaire Dennis
</a>
 and members of the Sequoia Symposium showed me 
a 120 triangular faced polyhedron that was important to her because she 
experienced this "watery" polyhedron during a near death experience. 
I was able to identify
this polyhedron from my study of R. Buckminster Fuller's work. Fuller<sup>1</sup>
described how the sphere can be broken into 120 LCD
spherical triangles, which leads to a 120 triangular faced convex polyhedron 
that seemed to match the polyhedron she experienced. 
However, it was not until I understood that the polyhedron that she  
was describing was mixed, that is concave/convex (the
polyhedron had bumps), that I began to explore other possibilities.
</p>
<p> 
This article presents the current information I have developed for 
Lynnclaire's 120 "bubble" Polyhedron. It is my hope
that this dynamic structure, with all its amazing relations and dynamics, 
turns out to be as important as Lynnclaire thinks it is.  Whether it does or not, 
this is truely an amazing polyhedron worthy of further study.
<P>

investigating the information, implications and meaning of her near 
death experiences.

<P>To start off, here are some illustrations of the 120 Polyhedron.

<P>This polyhedron has 120 triangular faces, 180 edges, and 62 vertices. 
To check that these numbers are consistent, we use Euler's formula 
for the topological features of polyhedra:

<H2 ALIGN="CENTER">3. Shared Vertex Inventory</H2>

<FONT SIZE=4>

<P>It turns out that other polyhedra can be constructed using the 
62 vertices of this polyhedron. For example, the next illustration 
shows the regular Dodecahedron positioned within the 120 Polyhedron. 
</P>

</P>

<P>Notice that the regular Dodecahedron, which has 20 vertices, 
is positioned in such a way as to share 20 of the 120 Polyhedron's vertices.

<P>In fact, <B><I>all</B></I> of the Platonic polyhdera can similarly 
be positioned within the 120 Polyhedron, sharing the 120 Polyhedron's 
vertices. This is cataloged in the next 4 illustrations.

<P>
In Fuller's "Cosmic Hierarchy"<sup>1</sup>, 
the regular Dodecahedron and Icosahedron do not share their vertices 
with any of the other polyhedra within the hierarchy.  Their inability to "fit in"
with the other polyhedra shows one of the limitations of Fuller's Cosmic Hierarchy. 
The problem arises, as will be shown below, because the model is too dependent on 
the concept of a single static vector matrix, which Fuller calls the Isotropic
Vector Matrix (IVM), from which all polyhedra are to be measured.  However, the 
polyhedra in the 120 Polyhedra arise from a <B><I>single dynamic motion</I></B>, 
which Fuller was well aware of and for which he named the "Jitterbug" motion. 
(This will be shown below.)
<P>  
As shown above, the 120 Polyhedron provides a way to include the regular Dodecahedron
and the Icosahedron into a single polyhedral system.
All the Platonic "solids" share their vertices with the 120 Polyhedron. 
</P>

<P>This is not the end to the inventory of polyhedra to be found 
in the 120 Polyhedron. There also occurs the rhombic Dodecahedron 
and the rhombic Triacontahedron. 
</P>

<P>If we consider not only the 62 vertices of the 120 Polyhedron 
but also the intersection points resulting from the above inventory 
of polyhedra's edges intersecting with one another, there are even more well 
known polyhedra to be seen. 
</P>

<P>In particular, from the intersection of the Octahedron and the 
Cube, the Cubeoctahedron is defined. Fuller called the Cubeoctahedron
the Vector Equilibrium (VE).

<P>The cube and the regular Dodecahedron share the same vertices of 
the 120 Polyhedron, as shown in the next sequence of illustrations.

<P>In fact, we find that 5 different Cubes can be arranged 
inside the Dodecahedron. Each of the 
Dodecahedron's vertices is shared with 2 Cube vertices.

<P>This led me to consider the possibility of 4 cubes rotating in such a 
way as to "spring forth" from a single 5th Cube and freezing into the 
regular Dodecahedron position. 
</P>

<P>Consider a single cube. It has 8 vertices. 
</P>

<P>We can use opposite vertices as axes of rotations for the cube. 
There are then 4 vertex-to-opposite-vertex rotation axes. 
</P>

<P>

   </td>
 </table>
</P>

<P>If we place 5 cubes, of the same size, in the same position, 
and leave one of the 5 cubes fixed, we can use these 4 rotation axes 
to rotate the other 4 cubes. We assign each of the 4 cubes to a different 
rotation axis. 
</P>

<P>When we rotate each of the 4 cubes by an angular amount 
of 44.47751219&deg;(approximately), clockwise around the 1st axis, 
counter clockwise around the 2nd, clockwise around the 3rd, 
counter clockwise around the 4th, 
we find that the vertices of all the cubes define a regular Dodecahedron.

</P>

<P>An interesting feature of this dynamic definition of the regular 
Dodecahedron, using the rotation of the Cubes, is that 2 orientations 
of the Dodecahedron appear. Here are 2 frames from the above gif movie 
in which I have added some black lines to outline some of the 
Dodecahedron's edges to show the 2 orientations of the regular 
Dodecahedron.

    Figs. 4.9, 4.10 <i>Two orientations of the Dodecahedron</i>
   </td> 
 </table>
</P>

<P>For each Cube an Octahedron is can be defined. The Octahedron 
is the "dual" polyhedron of the Cube. A "dual" of a polyhedron is (loosely) 
defined by replacing all vertices with faces and all faces by vertices. 
So, a cube having 8 vertices and 6 faces will have a dual polyhedron consisting of 
8 faces and 6 vertices. This is the Octahedron.

 </TABLE>
</DIV>

<P>So, there are 5 Octahedra for the 5 Cubes we have been considering. 
</P>

<P>If we now rotate the 4 Octahedra with the 4 Cubes (keeping 
one Cube and its Octahedron fix) by the angular amount 
of 44.47751219&deg;(approximately) 
mentioned above, both the Octahedra and Cube vertices will coincide with vertices 
of the 120 Polyhedron.

   </td>
 </TABLE>
</DIV>

<P>The 5 Cube's vertices coincide with the regular Dodecahedron's 20 
vertices, which coincide with 20 vertices of the 120 Polyhedron. 
The 5 Octahedra have a total of 5x6=30 vertices and these coincide 
with 30 vertices of the 120 Polyhedron. This leaves 62-20-30=12 vertices 
of the 120 Polyhedron unassigned. These 12 vertices correspond to the 12 vertices
of an Icosahedron, which is the dual of the regular Dodecahedron. 
</P>

<P>Before continuing with this rotational development of the 120 Polyhedron,
let us take a look at another polyhedron associated with the Cube and the
regular Dodecahedron.
