<H1 ALIGN=center>Emergence of 4-fold Symmetry from 5-fold Symmetry</H1>

<HR>
<P>
Consider the Icosahedron.  It has 12 vertices, 30 edges and 20 
triangular faces.  
</P>
<P>
If we spin the Icosahedron about an axis through, say, 2 opposite
vertices, a great circle is defined.  This is the "equator" as the
icosahedron is spun.  
</P>
<P>
From the above inventory of vertices, edges and faces, we find
that we can generate the following great circles of symmetry
from the following axes of the Icosahedron:

<TABLE>
<TR><TD><IMG ALIGN=middle SRC="images/ICOSAGC2.gif"></TD>
    <TD>6 spin axes through the 12 vertices (The thick lines
        are shown only to identify the Icosahedron)</TD>
<TR><TD><IMG ALIGN=middle SRC="images/ICOSAGC3.gif"></TD>
    <TD>15 spin axes through the 30 opposite mid-edge points
        (The thick lines are included as part of the great circles) </TD>
<TR><TD><IMG ALIGN=middle SRC="images/ICOSAGC4.gif"></TD>
    <TD>10 spin axes through the 20 opposite face centers
        (The thick lines are shown only to identify the Icosahedron)</TD>
</TABLE>
for a total of 31 spin axes (and 31 great circles). 
</P>

<P>
Combining all the great circles together results in the 
following image.

In the next illustration, one of the 120 LCD spherical triangles 
of the Icosahedron has been colored.
</P>

<P>
If we look again at the great circles generated by the 10 
axes of spin of the Icosahedron's 20 face centers, we discover 
that these great circles generate the outline of the Vector
Equilibrium (cuboctahedron).  This illustrates how the 
5-fold symmetrical system of the Icosahedron generates the 
4-fold symmetry system.  
</P>

<P>
It is also possible to identify the spherical  
octahedron defined by the Icosahedron's great circles.
</P>

<P>
Here then is a bridge between 5-fold and 4-fold symmetrical 
systems. 
</P> 

<P>
The "skew" angle between the Icosahedron's triangular face
and the VE's triangular face is (approx.) 22.238756 degrees.
The two triangular faces have the same face centers.
</P>
