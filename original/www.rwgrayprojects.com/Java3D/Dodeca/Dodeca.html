It is known that the regular Tetrahedron "fits" into the regular 
Dodecahedron in a "rational" way.   That is, the 4 vertices of the 
Tetrahedron can be oriented and scaled to match exactly 
with 4 of the 20 vertices of the regular Dodecahedron
</P>

<P>
This is one way of connecting the 2-3 fold symmetry of the
Tetrahedron with the 5-fold symmetry of the regular Dodecahedron.
(There are 2 other ways to do this that I am aware of.)
</P>

<P>
The regular Dodecahdron has 20 vertices.
The tetrahedron has 4 vertices.  It turns out that you can
"fit" 20 / 4 = 5 regular tetrahedra inside the regular Dodecahedron.
</P>

<P>
I recently discovered that you can do this in 2 different ways such
that no 2 tetrahedra share the same Dodecahedron vertex. 
</P>

<P>
Here is a sequence of images which shows the build up of 
5 tetrahedra inside the regular Dodecahedron.

Now we are about to discover something interesting...
</P>

<P>
Looking through a Dodecahedron face at the 
five tetrahedra, we see that the tetrahedra's edges go 
from the Dodecahedron's
vertices "down" into the Dodecahedron.
And the edges go toward, but not directly at, 
the center of the face.
</P>

<P>
Because the tetrahedra edges don't go directly toward the 
face center, but rather, skew past it, there is defined a
"vortex-like" twist induced by the tetrahedra.
</P> 


<P ALIGN=center>
<IMG SRC="dodeca07.gif">
</P>


<P>
In the above image, the tetrahedra seem to suggest a clockwise 
twist.
</P>

<P>
This reminds me, a little, of water vortices (or spirals) in 
which you can see that the inner surface of the water funnel
is not smooth but has ripples, or "threads" to it.  And the threads
merge together as they spiral deeper into the funnel.
</P>

<P>
Now, by rotating this regular Dodecahedron, we find that <I>all</I> the
faces have the same clockwise orientation.
</P>

<P>
I then found that it is possible to position the tetrahedra so that
they give a counter-clockwise "twisting" orientation.
</P>

</P>

<P>
To see this more clearly, I have drawn in the edges.

<P>
I do not know if any of this has any application.
