<H1 ALIGN=center>Installation Steps</H1>

<BR><BR><BR>


<P>
Here is how to get Java 3D installed on your Windows 
computer.
</P>

<P>
There are 2 pieces of software that you need to download 
from the Sun Micro Systems web pages.  Both are free.
They are the Java 1.3 SDK and the Java 3D package.
</P>

<P>
The first is the latest version of Java.
</P>

<P>
Go to the Sun site and download the Java 1.3 SDK.  
</P>

<IMG SRC="inst01.gif">

<P>
When you click on the "FTP Dowmload" button, you will 
see it start to download onto your computer.
</P>

<IMG SRC="inst02.gif">

<P>
Once the download is completed, you need to go to 
the directory (folder) into which it put the 
file just downloaded.  The filename is "j2sdk1_3_0-win.exe".
Double click on this file to start unpacking and
installing the software.
</P>

<IMG SRC="inst08.gif">
<BR>
<IMG SRC="inst09.gif">

<P>
The first screen is the "Welcome" screen.  Click the 
"Next" button.
</P>

<IMG SRC="inst10.gif">

<P>
Then there is a Copyright notice and then the
"Choose Destination" screen.  If possible, you should
not change the destination.  There is nothing wrong
if you do change the destination.  You will simply
have to remember the destination into which you 
installed the Java software.  The default destination
is "C:\jdk1.3".
</P>

<IMG SRC="inst11.gif">

<P>
Next choose the components to install.  I usually 
don't install the "Demos" nor the "Java Sources".
</P>

<IMG SRC="inst12.gif">

<P>
Clicking the "Next" button should start the installation.
When it is completed you will see the following screen.
</P>

<IMG SRC="inst13.gif">

<P>
You can read the "README" file if you want to. 
</P>

<P>
Java is now installed on your system.  There are a
few additional steps to make the "Java Plugin" work
with your web browser.  We'll do that after we
install the Java 3D software.
</P>

<P>
So, next go to the Sun web site for Java 3D.
</P>

<IMG SRC="inst03.gif">

<P>
There are several web pages you have to go through
to download the Java 3D package.
</P>
<P>
Click on whichever version is "Now Available."
</P>

<IMG SRC="inst04.gif">

<P>
Select the operating system you use.  I clicked on 
the "Java 3D Windows RunTime and Examples for the JDK"
</P>

<IMG SRC="inst05.gif">
<P>
Click the "continue" button to (finally) get to the
download page.
</P>

<IMG SRC="inst06.gif">

<P>
Click the "FTP Download" button.  This will start to 
download the Java 3D package.
</P>

<IMG SRC="inst07.gif">

<P>
Note where it downloaded the package to.  Go to that
directory (folder) and you should see a file called
"java3d-1_2-win-opengl_sdk.exe".
</P>

<IMG SRC="inst14.gif">

<P>
Double click on this file to start the unpacking and
installation of Java 3D.
</P>
<IMG SRC="inst15.gif">

<P>
You will get another "Welcome" screen.
</P>

<IMG SRC="inst16.gif">

<P>
And another "Copyright" screen.
</P>

<P>
Then, after clicking on the "Next" button, you will
get to the "Destination" screen.
</P>

<P>
<B>Be careful here.</B>  Note that the default destination
is "c:\jdk1.2.2".  But, if you took the default 
destination when installing the Java software above
(first install above), then the Java package was installed
into "c:\jdk1.3".  So you need to change this "Destination
Folder" to be "c:\jdk1.3" (or whatever destination 
you specified when installing Java above).  
</P>

<IMG SRC="inst17.gif">

<P>
Click the "Browse..." button.
</P>

<IMG SRC="inst18.gif">
<P>
This lets you specify the destination location.
Type in "c:\jdk1.3".
</P>
<P>
Click "OK" and you should be back at the "Choose
Destination Location" screen with "c:\jdk1.3"
specified as the destination.
</P>
<IMG SRC="inst19.gif">

<P>
Click the "Next" button.
</P>
<IMG SRC="inst20.gif">

<P>
You don't need the "Example Files" nor the 
"Utility Source Files", so you can uncheck these
if you want.  Keeping them checked only means that
they will take up a little space on your disk. 
</P>

<P>
Click "Next" and the installation should proceed.  
When its done you should see this next screen.
</P>

<IMG SRC="inst21.gif">

<P>
Click "Finish".
</P>


<P>
Well, the software is now installed.
</P>

<P>
<B>But you have to tie it all together and let your 
web Browser know where to find everything.</B>
</P>
<P>
So, next go to your Windows "Control Panel".
</P>


<IMG SRC="inst22.gif">

<IMG SRC="inst23.gif">

<P>
You should see an icon for "Java Plug-in".  Double click
on the icon to start the "Java Plug-in Control Panel".
</P>

<IMG SRC="inst24.gif">

<IMG SRC="inst25.gif">

<P>
Click on the "Advanced" tab.
</P>

<IMG SRC="inst26.gif">

<P>
Click on the "Use Java Plug-in Default".  This will
list various Java directories.
</P>
<IMG SRC="inst26b.gif">
<P>
Click on "JDK 1.3 in C:\jdk1.3".
</P>
<IMG SRC="inst28.gif">

<P>
Then click on the "Apply" button.
</P>

<P>
You now have Java and Java 3D installed.
</P>

<P>
To see if its all installed correctly and to make sure
you can run Java 3D applets from the web, you can 
go to 
<A HREF="../Intro.html">
my web Java 3D page</A> and click on the underlined
"Click here".  
</P>

<IMG SRC="inst30.gif">

<P>
This should start Sun's "spinning cube" 
example.
</P>

<IMG SRC="inst31.gif">

<P>
If the spinning cube is not displayed then there is 
something wrong with the installation.
</P>
<P>
Go to the "c:\jdk1.3\jre\lib\ext" directory on 
your PC and make sure that there are 4 files there.
They should be called "j3daudio.jar", j3dcore.jar", 
j3dutils.jar", and vecmath.jar.
</P>
<P>
If these files are not in this directory then you need
to find them and copy them into this directory.  You
can use the "Find" option under the Windows "Start" 
button to find these files.  
</P>

<P>
If this doesn't fix the problem then you will
have to ask someone else.  There is a Java 3D
discussion group on the web which might be able 
to help you.
</P>

<P>
Good luck.
</P>
