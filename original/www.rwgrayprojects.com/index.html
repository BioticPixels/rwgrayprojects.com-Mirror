<H1 ALIGN="center">The Projects of R. W. Gray</H1>

<P>
I have been and continue to be involved in a diverse collection of
projects. I hope that you will find something of interest here.  
Below I list several general topics.  There is much more
detail behind these selections.

"According to Karl Popper, the true scientist is someone who tries to contradict 
his own assumptions." - Quoted from <i>The Memory of Water: Homoeopathy and the 
Battle of Ideas in the New Science</i> by Michel Schiff, Thorsons, 1994, p. 110.
</p>

<p>
I would add: And encourages others to do the same, both for his, as well as for their own,
assumptions.

   <A HREF="Optics/index.html"><B>Optics Studies</B></A>
    - I completed my Ph.D. in Optics in the Fall of 2015.  My dissertation topic was
    on wavefront and nodal aberration theory applied to space telescopes and to
    optical imaging systems having freeform surface shapes.  This section of 
    the website contains my dissertation and other Optics related notes.

    scanning electron microscopy (SEM), transmission electron microscopy (TEM),
    and scanning TEM (STEM).  The class also included electron 
    lithography using the SEM. This is my class project.
