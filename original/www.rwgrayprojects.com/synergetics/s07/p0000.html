 The word <I>tensegrity</I> is an invention: it is a contraction
of <I>tensional integrity.</I>
Tensegrity describes a structural-relationship principle
in which structural shape is
guaranteed by the finitely closed, comprehensively continuous,
tensional behaviors of the
system and not by the discontinuous and exclusively
local compressional member
behaviors. Tensegrity provides the ability to yield
increasingly without ultimately breaking
or coming asunder.

 The integrity of the whole structure is invested in
the finitely closed,
tensional-embracement network, and the compressions
are local islands. Elongated
compression tends to deflect and fail. Compressions
are disintegrable because they are not
atomically solid and can permit energy penetration between
their invisibly amassed
separate energy entities. As a compression member tends
to buckle, the buckling point
becomes a leverage fulcrum and the remainder of the
compression member above acts as a
lever arm, so that it becomes increasingly effective
in accelerating the failure by crushing
of its first buckled-in side. The leverage-accelerated
penetration brings about precessional
dispersal at 90 degrees.

 Tension structures arranged by man depend upon his
purest initial volition of
interpretation of pure principle. Tension is omnidirectionally
coherent. Tensegrity is an

 When we use the six-strut tetrahedron tensegrity with
tensegrity octahedra in
triple bond, we get an omnidirectional symmetry tensegrity
that is as symmetrically

 We have a mathematical phenomenon known as a geodesic.
A geodesic is
the most economical relationship between any two events.
It is a special case of geodesics
which finds that a seemingly straight line is the shortest
distance between two points in a
plane. Geodesic lines are also the shortest surface
distances between two points on the
outside of a sphere. Spherical great circles are geodesics.

 I prefer to stay with compound curvature because it
is structurally stronger
than either flat surfaces or simple cylindrical curvature
or conical curvature. The new
compound-curvature geodesic structures will employ the
tensegrity principles. The
comparative strength, performance, and weight tables
show clearly that the geodesic-
dome geometry is the most efficient of all compound-curvatured,
omnitriangulated,
domical structuring systems.

 All geodesic domes are tensegrity structures whether
or not the tension-
compression differentiations are visible to the observer.
Tensegrity geodesic spheres do
what they do because they have the properties of hydraulically
or pneumatically inflated
structures. Pneumatic structures, such as footballs,
provide a firm shape when inflated
because the atmospheric molecules inside are impinging
outward against the skin,
stretching it into accommodating roundness. When more
molecules are introduced into
enclosures by the air pump, their overcrowding increases
the pressure. All the molecules
of gas have inherent geometrical domains of activity.
The pressurized crowding is dynamic
and not static.

 A fleet of ships maneuvering under power needs more
room than do the
ships of the same fleet when docked side by side. The
higher the speed of the individual
ships, the greater the sea room required. This means
that the enclosed and pressurized
molecules in pneumatic structural systems are accelerated
in outward-bound paths by the
addition of more molecules by the pump and, without
additional room, each must move
faster to get out of the way of others.

 The pressurized internal liquid or gaseous molecules
try to escape from their
confining enclosure. The outward-bound molecules impact
evenly upon all the inside
surface of the enclosure<SUP>&#95;&#95;</SUP>for instance, upon all of the
football's flexible inside skin when
it is kicked in one spot from outside. Their many outward-bound
impactings force the skin
outwardly and firmly in all directions, and the faster
they move, the more powerful the
impact. This molecular acceleration is misidentified
as pressures and firmness of the
pneumatic complex. This molecular acceleration distributes
the force loads evenly. The
outward forces are met by the comprehensive embracement
of all the tensile envelope's
combined local strengths. All locally impacting external
loads, such as the kick given to a
point on the football's exterior, are distributed by
all the enclosed atmospheric molecules
to all of the skin in the innocuously low magnitudes.

 The ability to determine quite accurately what the
local loadings of any given
pneumatic structure will be under varying conditions
and forces is well known and is about
as far as the pneumatic sciences have gone in explaining
inflated structures. The

 It is, however, possible to find out experimentally
a great deal more about
the behavior of those invisible, captive, atmospheric
molecules and to arrive at a greater
geo-mathematical understanding of the structural relationships
between pneumatically
inflated bags or vessels and geodesic tensegrity spheres
and domes. It is thus possible also
to design tensile structures that meet discretely, ergo
nonredundantly, the patterns of
outwardly impinging forces. It also becomes possible,
for the first time, for structural
engineers to analyze geodesic domes in a realistic and
safe manner. Up to this time, the
whole engineering profession has been analyzing geodesics
on a strictly <I>continuous-
compression,</I> crystalline, non-load-distributing, "post-and-lintel"
basis. For this reason, the
big geodesic domes thus far erected have been way overbuilt
by many times their logically
desirable two-to-one safety factor.

 While the building business uses safety factors of
four, five, or six-to-one,
aircraft-building employs only two-to-one or even less
because it knows what it is doing.
The greater the ignorance in the art, the greater the
safety factor that must be applied. And
the greater the safety factor, the greater the redundancy
and the less the freedom of load
distribution.

 First we recall, as has long been known experimentally,
that every action has
a reaction. For a molecule of gas to be impelled in
one direction, it must "shove off from,"
or be impelled by, another molecule accelerated in an
opposite direction. Both of the
oppositely paired and impelled action and reaction molecules
inside the pneumatically
expanded domes will impinge respectively upon two chordally
opposed points on the
inside of the skin. The middle point of a circular chord
is always nearer the center of the
circle than are its two ends. For this reason, chords
(of arcs of spheres) impinge outwardly
against the skin in an acutely glancing angular pattern.

 When two molecules accelerate opposingly from one
another at the center of
the sphere, their outward trajectories describe a straight
line that coincides with the
diameter of a sphere. They therefore impinge on the
skin perpendicularly, i.e., at 180
degrees, and bounce right back to the sphere center.
It is experimentally evidenced that all
but two of the myriad molecules of the captive gas do
not emanate opposingly from one
another at the center of the sphere, for only one pair
can occupy one point of tangent
bounce-off between any two molecules. If other molecules
could occupy the nucleus
position simultaneously, they would have to do so implosively
by symmetrical self-
compression, allowing the sphere to collapse, immediately
after which they would all
explode simultaneously. No such pulsating implosion-explosion,
collapse-and-expand
behavior by any pneumatic balls has been witnessed experimentally.

 Molecules of gas accelerating away from one another
and trying to proceed
in straight trajectories must follow both the shortest-distance
geodesic law as well as the
angular-reflectance law; they will carom around inside
a sphere only in circular paths
describing the greatest diameter possible, therefore
always in great-circle or geodesic
paths.

 For the same reasons, molecules cannot be "stacked
up" inside the sphere in
parallel or lesser-circle latitude planes. We also found
earlier that the molecules could not
be exploding simultaneously in all directions from the
center of the sphere. If thin, colored
vapor streaks are introduced into a transparently skinned,
pneumatically pressurized
sphere, then only at first superficial observation do
the smoke-disclosed molecular motions
seem to be demonstrating chaotically random patterns.
This is not the case, however, for
everything in Universe is in motion and everything in
motion is always traveling in the
direction of least resistance, wherefore the great circle's
inherent polar symmetries of
interaction <I>must impose polar order</I><SUP>&#95;&#95;</SUP>an order that is
hidden from the observer only by its
articulative velocities, which transcend the human's
optically tunable, "velocity-of-
motions" spectrum range of apprehending and therefore
appear only as clouds of random
disorder. Brouwer's theorem shows that when x number
of points are stirred randomly on
a plane, it can be proved mathematically<SUP>&#95;&#95;</SUP>when the stirring
is stopped<SUP>&#95;&#95;</SUP>that one of the
points was always at the center of the total stirring,
and was therefore never disturbed in
respect to all the others. It is also demonstrable that
any plane surface suitable for stirring
things upon, must be part of a system that has an obverse
surface polarly opposite to that
used for the stirring, and that it too must have its
center of stirring; and the two produce
poles in any bestirred complex system.

 Every great circle always intercepts any other great
circle twice, the
interception points always being 180-degree polar opposites.
When two force vectors
operating in great-circle paths inside a sphere impinge
on each other at any happenstance
angle, that angle has no amplitude stability. But when
a third force vector operating in a
great-circle path crosses the other two spherical great
circles, a great-circle-edged triangle
is formed with its inherently regenerated 180-degree
mirror-image polar opposite triangle.
With a myriad of successive inside surface caromings
and angular intervector
impingements, the dynamic symmetry imposed by a sphere
tends to equalize the angular
interrelationship of all those triangle-forming sets
of three great circles which shuntings
automatically tend averagingly to reproduce symmetrical
systems of omnisimilar spherical
triangles always exactly reproduced in their opposite
hemispheres, quarterspheres, and
octaspheres. This means that if there were only three
great circles, they would tend swiftly
to interstabilize comprehensively as the spherical octahedron
all of whose surface angles
and arcs (central angles) average as 90 degrees.

 A vast number of molecules of gas interacting in great
circles inside of a
sphere will produce a number of great-circle triangles.
The velocity of their
accomplishment of this structural system of total intertriangulation
averaging will seem to
be "instantaneous" to the human observer. The triangles,
being dynamically resilient,
mutably intertransform one another, imposing an averaging
of the random-force vectors of
the entire system, resulting in angular self-interstabilizing
as a pattern of omnispherical
symmetry. The aggregate of all the inter-great-circlings
resolve themselves typically into a
regular pattern of 12 pentagons and 20 triangles; or
sometimes more complexedly, into 12
pentagons, 30 hexagons, and 80 triangles described by
240 great-circle chords.

 In the geodesic tensegrity sphere, each of the entirely

compressional chord struts represents two oppositely
directioned and force-paired
molecules. The tensegrity compressional chords do not
touch one another. They operate

but are held in by the

joints of two axes or three axes of
freedom are analogous to the wire wheel as a basic 12-degrees-of-freedom

effectiveness relies upon their
discrete mechanical and structural differentiation and
disposition of all tension and

 The shafted axis of the two-axis universal joint tends
to make it appear as a
single-axis system. But it constitutes in actuality
an octahedral tensegrity, with its yoke
planes symmetrically oriented at 90 degrees to one another.
The two-axis tensegrity has
been long known and is often successfully employed by
mechanics as a flexible-membrane
coupling sandwiched between two diametrically opposed
yoke-ended shafts,
precessionally oriented to one another in a 90-degree
star pattern. This only tensionally
interlinked, i.e., universally jointed, drive shafting
has for centuries been demonstrating the
discontinuous compression and only tensionally continuous
multiaxial, multidimensional
symmetry of tensegrity structuring and energetic work
transmission from here to there.

 The barrel represents an advanced phase of the Roman
arch principle of
stability accomplished by simple (approximately) single-axis
curvature. A barrel is
comprised of a complete ring around one axis of a number
of parallel staves. A cross
section cut through the barrel perpendicular to its
single axis of curvature shows each of
the stave's sections looking like keystones in an arch.
Each stave is a truncated section of
a triangle whose interior cutaway apex would be at the
center of the barrel. The staves
employ only the outer trapezoidal wedge-shaped cross
section, dispensing with the
unnecessary inner part of the triangle. The stave's
cross section is wedge-shaped because
the outer edge of the stave is longer than the inner
edge of the stave. Because the stave's
outer-circle chord is longer than its inner-circle chord,
it cannot fall inwardly between the
other staves and it cannot fall outwardly from close-packed
association with the other
staves because they are all bound inwardly together
by the finitely closed barrel "hoops" of
steel.

 All these barrel staves are lined in parallel to one
another and are bound
cylindrically. They constitute a finite, closed cylinder
held together in compression by
finitely encompassing tension bands, or hoops, which
are parallel to one another and at 90
degrees to the axis of the staves. The staves cannot
move outwardly due to the finiteness
of the straps closing back upon themselves; they cannot
fall inwardly on each other
because their external chords are bigger than their
internal chords. The tendency of
internally loaded cylinders and vertically compressed
columns to curve outwardly at their
midgirth in their vertical profile is favored by designing
and making the barrel staves of
greater cross section at their midbarrel portions and
the finite, closed-circle bands of lesser
diameter near the ends than at the middle. The curving
lines of compression thrust back
against themselves, while the tension lines tend to
pull true and form a finite closure,
pressing the short, true chord sections of the staves
tightly against one another in a
complete circular arch; thus the staves may be flexed,
when the barrel is internally filled,
without tendency to failure.

 Thus the barrel, when in good material condition,
usually proves to be
structurally stable and able to withstand the impact
of dropping, especially when internally
loaded, because the internal load tends to distribute
any local shock load to all the
enclosing barrel's internal surface and thence to the
finitely closed, steel circle bands.
Barrels constitute closed circuits of continuous tension
finitely restraining discontinuous,
though contiguously islanded, staves of compression
in dynamic stability. Whether
pressure is exerted upon its structure from outside
or inside the barrel, the result is always
an outward thrust of the staves against the tension
members, whose finite closure and
cross-sectional strength ultimately absorb all the working
or random loads. The vertical
forces of gravity in the primary working stresses of
internally loaded, simple-curvature
structures<SUP>&#95;&#95;</SUP>such as those of the cylinder, barrel, tree
trunk, or Greek column<SUP>&#95;&#95;</SUP>are
translated precessionally into horizontally outward
buckling and torque stresses. When,
however, such cylinders are not internally loaded and
are turned over on their side with
their axes horizontal, the stresses are precessed horizontally,
outward from the cylinder
ends toward the infinite poles of cylindrically paralleled
stave lines. Under these
conditions, the outer hoops' girth does not aid the
structural interstabilization, and the
forces of gravity acting vertically against the horizontally
paralleled staves develop a lever
arm of the topmost staves against the opposite outer
staves of the barrel, tending to thrust
open the sidemost staves from one another and thus allowing
the integrity of the arch to
be disintegrated, allowing infinity to enter and disintegrate
the system.

 Each of the barrel's tension hoops represents a separately
operating,
exclusively tensional circle with its plane parallel
to, and remote from, the planes of the
other, only separately acting, barrel hoops. The tension
bands do not touch one another.
The tension bands are only parallel to one another and
act only at 90 degrees against the
staves, which are also only parallel to one another.
Neither the staves nor the tension
hoops cross one another in such a manner as to provide
intertriangulation and its
concomitant structural self-stabilization. In fact,
they both let infinity into the system to
disintegrate it between the only parallel staves and
hoops whose separate parts reach
forever separately only toward infinity.

 If we take a blowtorch and bum out one of the wooden
staves, the whole
barrel collapses because infinity floods in to provide
enough space between the staves for
their arch to be breached and thus collapse disintegratively.
What the blowtorch does is to
let infinity<SUP>&#95;&#95;</SUP>or the nothingness of Universe<SUP>&#95;&#95;</SUP>into the
system to intrude between the
discontinuous and previously only contiguously crowded
together, exclusively
compressional members of the system.

 Barrels and casks, which provided great shipping and
storage "container
advantage" in the past, secured only by finite closure
continuities of the only separately
acting tension circles, were inherently very limited
in structural efficiency due to the
infinitely extendable<SUP>&#95;&#95;</SUP>ergo, infinitely disassociative<SUP>&#95;&#95;</SUP>staves
as well as by the infinity that
intruded disintegratively between the barrel's parallel
sets of circular bands or hoops.
