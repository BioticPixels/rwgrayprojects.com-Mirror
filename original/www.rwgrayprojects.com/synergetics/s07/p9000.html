 Everyone thinks he knows the meaning of the word structure.
We point to a
stone wall or a bridge or a barn and say, "That's a
structure." What is common to a steel
bridge, a wooden barn, a jumbo jet, an iceberg, a starfish,
a star, a fern, a diamond jewel,
an elephant, a cloud, and a human baby? They are all
structures. Some are more versatile
than others; some last longer than others. Why? Why
do the stone or wood or steel cohere
at all? If we understood a little more about structure,
it could lead to a better
understanding of the political and economic dilemmas
of our time. Political and economic
systems are structures<SUP>&#95;&#95;</SUP>often so ill-conceived as to
require constant local patching and
mending. Even structural engineering has as yet failed
to comprehend adequately or to
define and cope with structure.

 We all have experiences of <I>pushing</I> and <I>pulling,</I> and
we think of them as
180-degree experiences directly away from us or toward
us. But (as we shall soon
discover) pushing and pulling both produce 90-degree
resultants, which we mistakenly call
"side effects." Our side effects are nature's primary
effects, and vice versa. Pushing is
outwardly explosive from a center of effort: that is
why a ping pong ball can ride on the
parting outward and downward of the waters of an only-vertically-aimed
fountain nozzle.
Gravity and magnetism are embracingly contractive

gases, <I>pull</I> is a partial
vacuum whereas <I>push</I> is an
explosion: attraction vs propulsion, tension vs compression.

 The gravitational or omnidirectional tension totality
in Universe is
quantitatively equal to the totality of the radiational

but the sum total of tensional coherence is more effectively
arranged than the sum total of
explosively disintegrative forces. This is why Universe
is finite. (See Sec.

its encircling hoop bands
illustrates the cosmic gravity-vs-radiation balance.
(See Figs.
 <A HREF="p0000.html#705.01">705.01</A>-.02.) The staves are
wedges<SUP>&#95;&#95;</SUP>each stave is wedged between two other truncated-triangle

segment of a
long, thin, isosceles triangle whose inner, sharply
pointed section-truncated and dispensed
with<SUP>&#95;&#95;</SUP>would have had its apex at the central axis of
the barrel. Each stave's outer chord is
always a little wider than its inner chord, wherefore
the staves cannot fall inward of one
another but could very readily move outwardly and apart,
were it not for the tension bands
that go completely around the barrel and close back
on themselves as a finite integrated
system.

 The staves are separate, disassociative, inherently
disintegrative, and self-
differentiating, while the barrel's external ring-bands
are self-integrating: though separate,
the two groups of members are operating complementarily
to produce union. It is the
embracing tension that successfully maintains the integrity
of the barrel despite the
disintegrative tendencies of the individual staves.
The push-pull components are more
effective associatively than they are separately. The
disintegrative explosive force is
embracingly cohered by the gravitational. So it is with
Universe.

 By contracting their girth, tensed lines of tension
tend to pull their fibers

interattractiveness increases as the second power of
the decrease in the distance between

 Tensional strength increases
initially, and therewith lies its
capability to cope with loading; when the girth contraction
rate is exceeded by the
elongation of the tension member, the atoms recede from
one another and coherence
decreases rapidly.

 Ropes can be pulled around corners. Neither stiff
poles nor flexible ropes can
be pushed around corners. Tension has a greater distance
range of capability than has
compression: witness the compression masts and the only-tensionally-suspended
long
center spans of the great suspension bridges. Tensional
capabilities are always more
versatile and energetically effective than are compressional
capabilities. The variable live
loads of suspension bridges are applied directly only
to its cables, which distribute the
loads evenly. In the same way the tensed tubes of automobile
tires receive the shock loads
locally and distribute them evenly.

 The taller a column is in proportion to its mid-girth
cross-section dimension,
the less the load it will bear before it tends to buckle,
which means to bend twistingly
outward in one direction, and<SUP>&#95;&#95;</SUP>if further loaded<SUP>&#95;&#95;</SUP>ultimately
to break into two columns.
In principle, tension members of structures have no
limit ratio of cross-section-to-length.
With materials of higher and higher tensile strength
it is possible to make longer and
longer and thinner and thinner tension cables-approaching
a condition of very great length
and no cross-section at all. (See Figs.
 <A HREF="../s06/p4100.html#641.01">641.01C-D</A>.)
With better and better alloys it is
possible to make longer and longer, thinner and thinner,
clear-span suspension bridges.
People tend erroneously to think of those cables as
"solid"<SUP>&#95;&#95;</SUP>and of the steel as solid<SUP>&#95;&#95;</SUP>but
they are not solid: the atoms are not touching one another.
The distances between the
nuclei of the atoms and their orbiting electrons-as
measured in diameters of their
nuclei<SUP>&#95;&#95;</SUP>are approximately the same proportionally as
the distance between our star Sun
and its planets. The individual atoms are in sufficiently
critical proximity to be sustainingly
attracted to one another as are the Earth and Moon,
which obviously are not touching
each other. In aeronautical terms they are all in dynamic
"flying formation." As the Earth
and the Moon co-orbit the Sun, and as the Sun and its
planets together are in flight
formation in our galactic system's merry-go-round, and
as the billions of galaxies
omnirecede from one another, they are all intersecured
by comprehensive mass attraction.
The mutual interpull force between Sun, Earth, and Moon
is manifest rotationally around
opposite sides of the Earth by the twice-a-day tides
as quadrillions of tons of water are
progressively pulled outward from Earth's surface jointly
by the Moon and the Sun-and
then are allowed to subside. In the Milky Way periphery
of our galaxy the stars do not
touch one another: they are in critical proximity. The
Universe itself is held together by
tension-invisible, substanceless tension that allows
for local motions and transformations.

 With the advent of mathematical calculating capability
into the public domain
only 500 years ago, we had the beginnings of mathematically
derived knowledge of cosmic
structuring principles. To understand the significance
of these principles we begin with
Isaac Newton. Newton was inspired by the prior discoveries
of Kepler, Galileo, and
Copernicus, and he derived his laws of motion from consideration
of their basic concepts,
as follows:
<OL TYPE="1">
<LI> Kepler discovered that all of the Sun's then known
six planets orbit the Sun in
elliptical paths.
<LI> The planets are of different sizes, each going around
the Sun at different rates
and at vastly different distances from the Sun.
<LI> In a given amount of time all of the planets "sweep
out" equal areas. For
instance, in a period of 21 days each planet describes
a relatively short elliptical
arc of travel around the Sun. If we connect the two
ends of those arcs by the
shortest radial lines to the Sun, and if we make proportionally
accurate
diagrams of each of the six pie-shaped pieces of sky
enclosed by the respective
arc-and-radii-bound areas, and if we use Kepler's carefully
measured
dimensions of those arcs and radii, we will find that
the several triangular
pieces of pie are very different in shape<SUP>&#95;&#95;</SUP>ranging from
very thin and long to
very short and wide-but when calculated for area, they
are all found to be of
exactly identical areas. (Compare Sec.
 <A HREF="../s06/p4600.html#646.11">646.11</A>.)
<LI> The coordination of these planetary motions was
found to be exquisitely
accurate but hidden invisibly in disparate observational
data. Considered
separately, each planet had unique behavioral characteristics
that could not be
explained by any mechanics of physical contact such
as that of a train of teeth-
meshed gears. The planets and the Sun are vast distances
apart. Kepler must
have noted that a weight on the end of a string hand-swung
by a human around
the head will<SUP>&#95;&#95;</SUP>when released into orbit<SUP>&#95;&#95;</SUP>travel tangentially
and horizontally
away from the human, while being progressively diverted
toward Earth by the
gravitational pull. Thus Kepler concluded that invisible
tensile forces were
intercohering the orbiting planets with the Sun and,
to a lesser extent, with
each other.
<LI> Galileo's measurement of the accelerating acceleration
in the rate of bodies
falling freely toward Earth indicated that each time
the distance between the
falling body and the Earth was halved, the speed of
falling increased fourfold.
<LI> Newton was also impressed by the enormous magnitude
of the tidal pulling of
the Earth's waters by the Moon and the Sun.
<LI> The astronomers and navigators had established information
governing the
seemingly "fixed" interpositions of certain celestial
star patterns at any given
moment of the year as viewed from any given position
on Earth. Of course,
much of the celestial sphere patterning is obscured
from any human observer
on Earth's surface by the vast bulk of our planet. But
Newton knew from
personal experience that the position (as calculated
by spherical geometry) of
any one of the viewable stars as measured in angular
height above the
observer's horizon in any given compass direction at
any chronometer-
recorded moment of time on any given annual calendar
day will permit the
observer to make accurate calculation of his position
on Earth.

 In consideration of all the foregoing seven concepts<SUP>&#95;&#95;</SUP>and
much other
information<SUP>&#95;&#95;</SUP>Isaac Newton concluded that the relative
magnitude of interpull forces of
planetary coordination was proportional to the masses
of the bodies involved. He
concluded that the interpull between two apples would
be so insignificant in proportion to
the pull of massive Earth upon both apples that the
two apples near one another on the
table would be so powerfully pulled against the table
as to manifest no measurable pull
toward each other. Apparently the extraordinary interpulling
of Universe could only be
manifested in free space; thus it had never been noticed
by humans in their preoccupation
with Earthian affairs.

 Newton reasoned from Kepler's work that if he swung
a weight around his
head and then let go of it, it would start off in a
horizontal line but become overpowered
by gravity and swiftly veer away 90 degrees vertically
toward Earth. Thus Newton
formulated his first law of motion, that all bodies
will persist in a state of rest or in a line
of motion <I>except</I> as affected by other bodies.

 Newton reasoned that if Earth were to be annihilated,
it would relinquish its
pull on the Moon, and then the Moon would be free to
fly off tangentially on an
approximately linear course. He chose a night of full
Moon at a given moment of clock
time to observe the Moon<SUP>&#95;&#95;</SUP>well above the horizon<SUP>&#95;&#95;</SUP>predictably
positioned against the
celestial pattern of the "fixed" stars. He then calculated
the line of tangential direction
along which a released Moon would travel as traced against
the sky pattern. Newton then
observed and calculated the rate at which the Moon would
travel away from the
theoretical trajectory of release and "fall" toward
the Earth as they both orbited the Sun at
60,000 miles per hour.

 As a result of this observation and calculation Newton
found that the path of
the Moon's "fall" agreed exactly with the falling body
data of (Galileo. Wherefore Newton
concluded it was celestially manifest that
<OL TYPE="1">
<LI> relative to all known bodies, the magnitude of mutual
interattraction between
any two bodies is proportional to the product of their
paired and
intermultiplied masses; and
<LI> whenever the distance between two bodies is halved,
the force of their
interattraction increases fourfold, which is to say
that the interattraction
varies exponentially at a second-power rate as the distance
between the
considered bodies varies at only an arithmetical rate.

 For millennia humans had endeavored to explain the
apparently random
independence, the seemingly uncoordinated individual
motions, of the five planetary
bodies visible from Earth, orderly interpositioned against
the background of the vast
myriads of "fixed" stars of the celestial sphere. What
Newton had discovered is relevant to
our comprehension of the universal nature of structures.
He had discovered a pair of
integral characteristics of two bodies, with one interrelationship
varying at an exponential
rate and the other interrelationship covarying arithmetically.
Kepler and Newton had found
synergetic behaviors of whole systems that were unpredicted
by the behaviors or the
integral characteristics of any parts of the system
considered separately. Kepler and
Newton had found synergy.

 If you were a contemporary of Kepler or Newton and
were to have asked
them what the mass interattraction called "gravity"
<I>is,</I> they would have told you that they
had no way of knowing. And there is as yet no way to
explain the interrelationship
behaviors found experimentally to exist "between" and
not "of " any two objects in
Universe. The relationships they discovered are elegantly
reliable, but they are also an

 Humanity has inherited an inventory of generalized
laws of Universe from
the Copernicus-Kepler-Galileo-Newton discoveries, which
they in turn inherited from their
Greek, Mesopotamian, Egyptian, Indian, and Chinese predecessors.
There is no
information to suggest that the inventory has been completed.
All of the generalized laws
can be expressed in mathematical terms. They are all
eternally operative and
interaccommodative. Together, the thus-far-discovered
generalized laws guarantee the
integrity of nonsimultaneous, only partially overlapping,
Scenario Universe.

 The word <I>design</I> is used in contradistinction to random
happenstance.
Design is intellectually deliberate. Design means that
all the components of the
composition are interconsiderately arranged. In a design
the component behaviors,
proclivities, and mathematical behaviors are interaccommodative.
The family of
generalized principles constitutes an eternal cosmic
design whose interrelationships are
expressible only in abstract mathematical terms.

 Contrary to common opinion (even that of engineers),
structures are always
dynamic and never static. All structural realizations
are special case. Structural realizations
have specific longevities; they are entropic; they give
off energy. The energies are often
syntropically replaceable in the consequence of structural
transformations.

are structural systems.
Any and all structure consists entirely of atoms. Atoms
are not things: they are energy
events occurring in pure principle. Each and every experimentally

internal and external<SUP>&#95;&#95;</SUP>that

 I take a piece of rope and tense it. As I purposely
tense it, I inadvertently
make it more taut. But I was not tensing the rope for
the purpose of making it taut; my
brain was only trying to elongate the rope. As I do
so, however, the girth is inadvertently
contracting and the rope is inadvertently getting harder.
In getting harder the cross-section
of the rope is contracting radially in a plane at 90
degrees to the axis of my purposeful
tensing, thus inadvertently producing the always and
only coexisting action-reaction-and-
resultant complementations of myopic preoccupation.

 Next I purposely produce compression. I take tempered
steel rods, each
three feet long and one-eighth of an inch in diameter.
The rods bend flexively. We find that
two rods cannot get closer to one another than in parallel
tangency of their circular cross-
sections. A third rod cannot get closer to the other
two than by nestling in the parallel
valley between them. With each of the three rods in
parallel tangency, the centers of their
three circular cross-sections form an equilateral triangle.

 Hexagons consist of six equiangular triangles. Hexagons
have six
circumferential points and a center point<SUP>&#95;&#95;</SUP>seven in all<SUP>&#95;&#95;</SUP>all
equidistant from their
neighbors. Six rods now huddle in closest-packed tangency
around the original rod. (See
Fig. <A HREF="../s04/p1200.html#412.01">412.01</A>.)
And 12 more rods may be huddled around
the first seven to complete an
additional hexagonal perimeter. Successive perimeters
aggregate, each time with six more
rods than those of the previous ring. The outermost
rods will be tangentially closest
packed in triangular stabilization with their neighbors;
the rod at the center is at the
symmetrical nucleus of the aggregate. We note in nature
that the rodlike Earthward
trajectories of closely falling, inter-mass-attracted
raindrops passing through freezing
temperatures nucleate in hexagonal snowflake arrays
under just such hexagonal close-
packing laws.

 The Greek architects found experientially that when
the height of a stone
column exceeded its girth by 18 diameters, it tended
to fail by buckling out of the central
stone cylinder section. The length-to-diameter ratio
of a compressional column is called its
<I>slenderness ratio.</I> Continuous steel columns are more
stable than stone columns and may
be used structurally with slenderness ratios as high
as 30 to 1<SUP>&#95;&#95;</SUP>these are long columns.
Short columns-with a slenderness ratio of 12 to 1<SUP>&#95;&#95;</SUP>tend
to fail by crushing rather than by
buckling.

 For our further experiment in <I>purposeful compression</I>
we assemble a column
36 inches high with a minimum girth diameter of three
inches. It requires 547 of our 36-
inch-long, one-eighth-inch-diameter rods to produce
this 12-to-1 short column. Each
individual rod is slender and highly buckleable, but
bound circumferentially together for its
full length by tightly wound steel wire. The rods will
close-pack symmetrically in a
hexagonal set of 13 concentric rings around a nuclear
rod: the maximum diameter will be
three and three-eighths inches. We can then add forged
steel caps over the hexagonal ends
of this integrated short column.

 We may next insert the column perpendicularly between
the upper and lower
jaws of a hydraulic press and load the composite column
in vertical compression. We
know from our earlier trial that each rod taken by itself
can bend when end-loaded. Being
close-packed together, they cannot bend further inwardly
toward the center rod: they can
only bend outwardly, straining the binding wire wrapped
around the rods and causing
them ultimately to yield to the severe outward force
at the column's mid-girth. The
bunched ends are held together by the hexagonal steel
caps as the force of the hydraulic
press increases. This results in the whole column twisting
mildly and bulging out to
become cigar-shaped as seen in vertical profile. If
loaded sufficiently, the bundle
approaches sphericity.

 This experiment indicates that our purposeful loading
of the column in
compression inadvertently results in its girth increasing
in diameter, which brings about
<I>tension</I> in the horizontally bound wires. An inadvertent
tension occurs in a plane at 90
degrees to the axis of compression.

 <B>Tidal Complementarities:</B> By two visibly different
experiments<SUP>&#95;&#95;</SUP>one with
rope and the other with steel rods<SUP>&#95;&#95;</SUP>we have demonstrated
experimentally that tension and
compression always and only coexist. One can be at <I>high
tide</I> of visibility and the other
coincidentally at <I>low tide,</I> or vice versa. These tidal
covariables are typical
complementarities: they are not mirror images of one
another, but must always balance
one another complexedly in physical equations. Both
demonstrate 90-degree inadvertent
resultants. In engineering this behavior is known as
the <I>Poisson effect,</I> and in physics it is
known as <I>precession.</I>

 <B>Spherical Islands:</B> Short columns loaded on their neutral
axes tend to bulge
toward sphericity of conformation. In the spherical
form-and only in the spherical-we find
that the system has no unique axis. Any diametric loading
in the sphere is in effect a
neutral axis. In coping with compressive loads, spheres
act most effectively regardless of
which is the loaded axis. Since spheres have the greatest
volume with the least surface,
loads are evenly distributed radially from the center
to all of the enclosing mass. Thus ball
bearings constitute the most effective of universal
load-bearing designs for compressional
functioning.

 We find nature preferentially investing her compressionally
assigned energy
tasks in sphericals<SUP>&#95;&#95;</SUP>whether stars, planets, asteroids,
oranges, or atoms. Universe isolates
all her major compression functions in spherical islands
that are vastly remote from one
another and that are intercohered only by Kepler's and
Newton's invisible tension: gravity.
The star Sun gravitationally precesses its compressionally
islanded planets to orbit around
it; the atomic nucleus gravitationally precesses its
islanded electrons to orbit around it.
Nature's cosmic structuring strategy employs only discontinuous
islanded compression
and only omni-everywhere continuous tension, <I>gravity.</I>
Paradoxically, Earthian engineers
as yet design their structures only as compressional
continuities, sometimes tied together
by tension rods and reinforcements. Humans still use
a primarily direct-compressional
Stone Age logic, using tension only as a secondary reinforcement.
Nature<SUP>&#95;&#95;</SUP>both
macrocosmically and microcosmically<SUP>&#95;&#95;</SUP>uses a primary tensional
logic, with compression
as a secondary islanded back-up.

 The Stone Age logic said that the wider and heavier
the walls, the more
happily secure would be the inhabitants. The advent
of metal alloys in the 20th century has
brought an abrupt change from the advantage of structural
ponderousness to the
advantage of structural lightness. This is at the heart
of all ephemeralization: that is the
dymaxion principle of doing ever more with ever less
weight, time, and ergs per each
given level of functional performance. With an average
recycling rate for all metals of 22
years, and with comparable design improvements in performance
per pound,
ephemeralization means that ever more people are being
served at ever higher standards
with the same old materials.
