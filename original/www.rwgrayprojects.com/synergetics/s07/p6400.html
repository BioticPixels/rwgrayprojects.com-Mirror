 Geodesics introduces tension as the integrity of structure.
Geodesics is in
fundamental contradistinction to the compressional arches
where men made lesser rings of
stone and bricks and so forth, like Santa Sophia, fitting
them together beautifully and
shaping them very mathematically to prevent their slipping
or falling inwardly from one
another to break the integrity of the compressional
rings. In Santa Sophia, they put a chain
around the bottom of the dome to take care of the outward
thrust of the enormous
weights of the aggregate trying to come apart. They
could not build an exclusively
compressionally composed dome that would not thrust
outwardly at the base, so they put
the chains around the bases to prevent their collapsing.

 We have seen that in tensional structures there is
no limit of length to cross
section: you can make as big a pneumatic bag as you
want. In the comprehensive,
geodesically omnitriangulated, tensegrity structures,
we are able to reach unlimited spans
because our only limitation is tension, where there
is no inherent limit to cross section due
to length. We get to where there is no cross section
visible at all, as in the pull between the
Earth and the Moon. With such structural insights we
can comprehend the structure of an
apple in terms of noncompressible hydraulic compression
and critical proximity cellular
wall tensioning. Synergetics identifies tensegrity with
high-tensile alloys, pneumatics,
hydraulics, and load distribution.

 A child playing in sticky snow may make a big mound
of snow and hollow it
out with his hands or a shovel to make a cave. The snow
is fascinating because you can
push it together and it will take on shapes. It has
coherence. Almost every child with
mittens on has built himself a mound and then started
chipping away to make a cave.
Looking at the hollowed mound from the outside, he may
discover that he has made a
rough dome. He might then conclude that whatever makes
the structure stand up has to
do with the circumferential interactions of the snow
crystals and their molecules and the
latter's atoms. He finds that he can get in it and that
the structural integrity has nothing to
do with the snow that used to be at the middle. So we
may develop a strong intuition
about this when we are very young: that it is the circumferential
set of molecules that are
accounting for the structural integrity of the dome.

 The child may then find by experiment that he might
hollow out the
pneumatic network and put not only one hole, but many
holes, in the snowdome shell, and
it continues to stand up. It becomes apparent that it
would be possible to take a pneumatic
balloon, pair the molecules doing the work, and get
rid of all the molecules at the center
that were not hitting the balloon<SUP>&#95;&#95;</SUP>for it is only the
molecules that hit the balloon at high
frequency of successive bounce-offs that give the balloon
its shape.

 What happens in the snow mound is also what happens
in the three-way
tensegrity geodesic spherical grid. In the balloon,
we get paths of these positively and
negatively paired kinetic molecules reacting from one
another in a random set of
directions. If they went into one path only, they would
make a single circle, which would
push the balloon outwardly only at its equator, making
a disc and allowing the poles to
collapse. If they made a two-way stack of parallel lesser
circles as a cylinder, the cylinder
would contract axially into a disc.

 Once we have three or more sets of angularly independent,
great-circularly
continued, push-pull paths, they must inherently triangulate
by push-pull into stabilization
of opposite angles. Triangulation means selfstabilizing;
which creates omnidirectional
symmetry; which makes an inherent three-way spherical
symmetry grid; which is the
geodesic structure.

 Turbining in tensegrity systems may derive from either
central angles or
surface angles. There is inherent comprehensive positive
or negative turbining of finite
systems in both central and surface angles. Central-angle
turbining effects surface-angle

 This brain-fixing fixity's conceptual interpretation
of experience is permitted
only by the infinitesimally short life span of humans
in the thus-far-discovered historical
magnitudes of universal history's events. As we stand
"fixedly" in "space" at the terrestrial
latitude most occupied by Earthian humans, we are revolving
around the-Earth's axis at
600 m.p.h. Together with our Moon, we orbit around Sun
at 60,000 m.p.h. (which orbital
speed is three times as fast as the Earth-Moon-ferrying,
Apollo-rocketed space vehicle),
and all the while our solar system, situated about three-quarters
of the way outward from

that inwardly active galaxy's billions
of stars<SUP>&#95;&#95;</SUP>are cosmically merry-go-rounding at approximately
a million miles per hour, and
all the while we participate in all these motions, our
Milky Way merry-go-round galaxy
itself may be, and is scientifically thought to be,
involved in comprehensive motion at an
even higher velocity. Due to the omnieverywhere-expanding
Universe (interpretation of
observed data), our galaxy and all the other of the
billions of galaxies of Universe are alike
in traveling outwardly from one another isotropically
at additional millions of miles per
hour.

 This expanding-Universe concept is easy to phrase
in words as reported, but
lucid comprehension of its import involves experientially
"impossible," three-dimensional,
space-motion conceptionalizing, for in order to travel
away cosmically from each of all the
spherically surrounding galaxies of our Milky Way, any
one of the billions of galaxies
seemingly would have to go outwardly in all directions
in order to go away from each of
them simultaneously. Obviously, however, this could
not be accomplished by any one of
them moving in only one direction<SUP>&#95;&#95;</SUP>which is humanity's
way of thinking of motion-unless
there were a center of galaxy of Universe outwardly
from which all others move <I>exactly</I>
and only radially, <I>or</I> unless all of Universe and all
of the galaxies and each and all
phenomena within them, including the smallest nuclear
particle, are either <I>expanding</I>
systematically and simultaneously or are <I>shrinking</I> systematically
and simultaneously, all
changing in size at a rate that is just a bit faster
than the speed of light, with either the
universal contraction or universal expansion of all
points in Universe producing the same

 This may be the universal effect of the <I>speed</I> of gravity,
whose force
(possibly in order to eternally cohere Universe) is,
as is often found experimentally, always
just a fraction greater than the cosmic speed of inherently
disintegrative radiation. (See
Sec.
 <A HREF="../s02/p2400.html#231.00">231</A>.)
 This conceptioning becomes lucid if one is
familiar with the vector equilibria
and their identity with isotropism, which spontaneously
accommodates coexpansion or
contraction independent of any Universe center, every
nuclear point within the system
being a Universe center, with all its 12 most immediate
neighbors always being equidistant
and bearing at the same total of central-angle magnitudes
from one another,<SUP>1</SUP> with the
circumferentially closed, embracing vector forces always
more effective than their equal

 Humans standing on Earth gazing outwardly from Earth
at the stars cannot
see the stars in the celestial sphere in the direction
of their feet. Earth is in the way. Earth
is so much in the way that humans at sea on a calm,
clear night can see only about half the
celestial sphere at any one time. An astronaut out "space-walking"
can see approximately
all of the stars of the celestial array omnisurrounding
him at vast varieties of distances
from him, though they all seem to be superficially on
the same concave surface of the same
black sphere at whose center the astro-observer seems
to be. Remembering the difference
between the Earth-standing observer's totality of sky
and the astronaut's also optically
illusioned but far more comprehensively stimulated conjuring
of the concept "totality," we
can understand why the Earth-standing observer on a
completely overcast day cannot see
the cloud cover as a dimensionally definable phenomenon,
whereas the astronaut seeing
the Earth at a distance wrapped in its cloud cover can
see Earth and its biosphere as a
dimensionally defined entity.

 When we speak of the cosmic limits of seemingly allspace
filling, we refer to
the totally surrounding, indefinable, extensive allspace-filling
effect of fog upon an
observer in that dense fog. It seemingly has no shape.
Nor has that fog a "shape" even
when it lifts into the sky above the observer and fills
the whole overhead spherical domain.
Observed from outer space at the same moment, however,
mantling Earth may seem to
have momentarily stable descriptability akin to that
of a frozen icefield. Then the same fog
or cloud blanket may be viewed at the same time by a
third human from a mountaintop
just protruding through the cloud. The third observer
sees that the clouds are
intertransforming in complex, high-speed turbulence,
vanishing here in rain and being
newly formed elsewhere by Sun-drawn evaporation. Every
atom involved in Earth's
ocean-atmosphere-intertransforming H<SUB>2</SUB>O cloud-cover phenomena,
visible or invisible, has
its integrity, and the allspace-filling events become
other than visible transformation
events, yet may indeed be kept account of by you and
me and Universe, with its
mathematical integrities of complexedly interaccommodative
principles of
intertransformative events always occurring interconsiderately.

 Seen from Moon, the total local dimensional involvement
of such Earthian
atmospheric-oceanic intertransforming events is well
within the field of a telephoto-lensed,
video-recording camera as well as of a battery of frequency
sensors ``seeing'' the humanly
invisible events transpire. The intertransformings are
finitely packagable and analyzable in
conformity to allspace-filling laws. That these same
events seem boundless to the Earthian
observer uninformed by the celestial-scanning instruments
need not obscure our realization
that what we mean by allspace-filling regularities are
omni-intertransformable<SUP>&#95;&#95;</SUP>ergo, are
scenarios of an aggregate of nonsimultaneously overlapping,
energy-transforming events
in which one or a few isolated frames of special-case
considerations fail to disclose the
meaning accruing only to large-continuity consideration
of the whole story.

 As a cosmic, generalized, intertransformability system
<I>field,</I> our allspace-
filling synergetics matrix accommodates and equates
these behaviors. Allspace filling is a
scenario: the eternally self-regenerative scenario of
cosmic integrity.

 <B>Eternality:</B> "Eternal" identifies only the metaphysical,
weightless, abstract
principles, which, to hold true in all special-case
experiences, are inherently eternal.

 Angles are eternally transcendental to time-size limits.
The angle is a
subdivision of one cycle quite independent of the length
size (time) of the angle-defining
radii edges of the angle. One-sixth of unity: the circle
is one-sixth independent of time and
size.

 Regularity is eternal. But the regularities are eternally
omni-

freedoms of selectable alternative
developments involving a vast plurality of time-dimensioned
frequency involvements.

 <B>Unitary Conceptuality of Allspace Filling:</B> Allspace
filling means all
unitarily conceptual space filling, because Universe,
though finite, is an aggregate of
nonsimultaneous and only partially overlapping event
transformations which, being
nonsimultaneous and differentially rate-frequenced,
are never momentarily subject to total
unitarily synchronized<SUP>&#95;&#95;</SUP>ergo, simultaneous, apparently
static system<SUP>&#95;&#95;</SUP>conceptualization.
