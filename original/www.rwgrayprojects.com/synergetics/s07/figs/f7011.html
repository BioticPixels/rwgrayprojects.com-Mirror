<TR><TD>Fig. 770.11 System Turbining in Tensegrity Structures:
<OL TYPE="A">
<LI> The two above both have six axes of symmetry. It
is the patterning of the thirty diamond domains of
the icosahedron's thirty edges, the rhombic triacontahedron.
<LI> The linear-congruence juncture of two positive or
two negative turbining-surface three-strut
tensegrity units.
<LI> Single-bonded tensegrity: turbining tendencies of
thrusts of C about A and B are additive.
<LI> Double-bonded tensegrity: turbining tendencies of
thrusts of C about A are opposed to those about B.
