Tensegrity Spheres:
<OL TYPE="A">
<LI> Negatively rotating triangles on a 270-strut tensegrity
geodesic sphere with double-bonded triangles.
<LI> A 270-strut isotropic tensegrity geodesic sphere:
single bonded turbo triangles forming a complex
six-frequency triacontahedron tensegrity.
<LI> Complex of basic three-strut tensegrities, with axial
alignment whose exterior terminals are to be
joined in single bond as 90-strut tensegrity.
<LI> Complex of basic three-strut tensegrity units with
exterior terminals now joined.
