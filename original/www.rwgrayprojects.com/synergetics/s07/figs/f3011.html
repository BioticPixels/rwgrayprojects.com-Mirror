<TR><TD>Fig. 730.11 Functions of Positive and Negative Tetrahedra
in Tensegrity Stacked Cubes: Every cube has
six faces (A). Every tetrahedron has six edges (B).
Every cube has eight corners and every tetrahedron
has four corners. Every cube contains two tetrahedra
(ABCD and WXYZ) because each of its six faces has
two diagonals, the positive and negative set. These
may be called the symmetrically juxtaposed positive
and negative tetrahedra whose centers of gravity are
congruent with one another as well as congruent
with the center of gravity of the cube (C). It is possible
to stack cubes (D) into two columns. One column
contains the positive tetrahedra (E) and the other contains
the negative tetrahedra (F).
