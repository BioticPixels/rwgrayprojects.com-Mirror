<TR><TD>Fig. 730.12 Stabilization of Tension in Tensegrity Column:
We put a steel sphere at the center of gravity
of a cube which is also the center of gravity of tetrahedron
and then run steel tubes from the center of
gravity to four corners, W,X,Y, and Z, of negative tetrahedron
(A). Every tetrahedron's center of gravity
has four radials from the center of gravity to the four
vertexes of the tetrahedron (B). In the juncture
between the two tetrahedra (D), ball joints at the center
of gravity are pulled toward one another by a
vertical tension stay, thus thrusting universally jointed
legs outwardly, and their outward thrust is stably
restrained by finite sling closure WXYZ. This system
is nonredundant: a basic discontinuous-compression
continuous-tension or "tensegrity" structure. It is
possible to have a stack (column) of center-of-gravity
radial tube tetrahedra struts (C) with horizontal (approximate)
tension slings and vertical tension guys
and diagonal tension edges of the four superimposed
tetrahedra, which, because of the (approximate)
horizontal slings, cannot come any closer to one another,
and, because of their vertical guys, cannot get
any further away from one another, and therefore compose
a stable relationship: a structure.
