<TR><TD>Fig. 762.01 Chordal Ricochet Pattern in Stretch Action
of a Balloon Net: A gas balloon's exterior
tension "net" has the shape that it has because some
of the molecules are too large to escape and, crowed
by the other molecules, are hitting the balloon. But
the molecules do not huddle together at the center
and
then simultaneously explode outwardly to hit the balloon
skin in one omnidirectionally outbound wave.
The molecules near the surface are coursing in chordally
ricocheting patterns all around the inner net's
surface. I therefore saw that<SUP>&#95;&#95;</SUP>because every action has
its reaction<SUP>&#95;&#95;</SUP>it would be possible to pair all the
molecules so that they would behave as can two swimmers
who dive into a swimming tank from opposite
ends, meet in the middle and then, employing each other's
inertia, shove off from each other's feet in
opposite directions.
