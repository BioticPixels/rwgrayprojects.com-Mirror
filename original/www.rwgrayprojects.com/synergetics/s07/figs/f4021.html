<TR><TD>Fig. 740.21 Tensegrity Masts as Struts: Miniaturization
Approaches Atomic Structure: The tensegrity
masts can be substituted for the individual (so-called
solid) struts in the tensegrity spheres. In each one
of
the separate tensegrity masts, acting as struts, in
the tensegrity spheres it can be seen that there are
little
(so-called) solid struts. A miniature tensegrity mast
may be substituted for each of those solid struts.
The
subminiature tensegrity mast within the tensegrity struts
of the tensegrity struts of the tensegrity sphere
and a subsubminiature tensegrity mast may be substituted
for each of those solid struts, and so on to
subsubsubminiature tensegrities until we finally get
down to the size of the atom and this becomes
completely compatible with the atom for the atom is
tensegrity and there are no "solids" left in the entire
structural system. There are no solids in structures,
ergo no solids in Universe. There is nothing
incompatible with what we may see as solid at the visual
level and what we are finding out to be the
structural relationships in nuclear physics.
