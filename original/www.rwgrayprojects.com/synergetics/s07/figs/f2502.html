<TR><TD>Fig. 725.02 Transformation of Six-Strut Tensegrity Structures:
A six-strut tensegrity tetrahedron (A) can
be transformed by changing the distribution and relative
lengths of its tension members (B, C) to the six-
strut icosahedron (D). A theoretical three-way coordinate
expansion can be envisioned with three parallel
pairs of constant-length struts in which a stretching
of tension members is permitted as the struts move
outwardly from a common center. Starting with a six-strut
octahedron (E), the structure expands
outwardly going through the icosahedron phase (F) to
the vector-equilibrium phase (G). When the
structure expands beyond the vector equilibrium, the
six struts become the edges of figure H. They
consequently lose their structural function (assuming
the original distribution of tension and compression
members remains unchanged). As the tension members become
substantially longer than the struts, the
struts tend to approach relative zero and the overall
shape of the structure approaches a super octahedron
(I, J).
