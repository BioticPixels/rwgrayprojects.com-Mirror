<TR><TD>Fig. 765.02 Stabilization of Three-Way-Grid Tensegrity
Sphere: What happens with the snow mound is
also exactly what happens in a three-way-grid tensegrity-geodesic
spherical grid. In the balloon we get
paths of these positively and negatively paired, kinetic
molecules reacting from one another in a random
set of directions. If they went into one path only,
they would make a single circle which would push the
balloon outwardly only at its equator making a disc
and allowing the poles to collapse. If they made a
two-way stack of parallel lesser circles as a cylinder,
the cylinder would contract axially into a disc. A
two-way grid would make only unstable squares and diamonds,
which would elongate into a tubular
snake. But once we have three or more sets of angularly
independent circularly continued push-pull
paths, they must inherently triangulate by push-pull
stabilization of opposite angles. Triangulation means
self-stabilizing, which creates omnidirectional symmetry,
which makes an inherent three-way spherical
symmetry grid, which is the geodesic structure.
