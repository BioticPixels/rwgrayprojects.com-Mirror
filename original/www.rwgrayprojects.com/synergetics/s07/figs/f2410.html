<LI> A six-strut tensegrity tetrahedron shows central-angle
turbining.
<LI> The three-strut tensegrity octahedron. The three
compression struts do not touch each other as they
pass at the center of the octahedron. They are held
together only at their terminals by the
comprehensive, triangular tension net. It is the simplest
form of tensegrity.
<LI> The 12-strut tensegrity cube, which is unstable.
