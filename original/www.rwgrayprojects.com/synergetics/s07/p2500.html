 Six-strut tensegrity tetrahedra can be transformed
in a plurality of ways by
changing the distribution and relative lengths of its
tension members to the six-strut
icosahedron.

 A theoretical three-way coordinate expansion can be
envisioned, with three
parallel pairs of constant-length struts, in which a
stretching of tension members is
permitted as the struts move outwardly from a common
center. Starting with a six-strut
octahedron, the structure expands outwardly, going through
the icosahedron phase to the
vector-equilibrium phase.

 When the structure expands beyond the vector equilibrium,
the six struts
become the edges of the figure; they consequently lose
their structural function (assuming
that the original distribution of tension and compression
members remains unchanged). As
the tension members become substantially longer than
the struts, the struts tend to
approach relative zero, and the overall shape of the
structure approaches a super
octahedron.

 <B>The Symmetrical, Six-Great-Circle-Planed, Pentagonally
Equatored
Tensegrity Sphere:</B> A basic tensegrity sphere can be
constituted of six equatorial-plane
pentagons, each of which consists of five independent
and nonintertouching compression
struts, totaling 30 separate nonintertouching compression
struts in all. This six-pentagon-
equatored tensegrity sphere interacts in a self-balanced
system, resulting in six polar axes
that are each perpendicular to one of its six equatorial
pentagonal planes. Twelve lesser-
circle-planed polar pentagons are found to be arrayed
perpendicular to the six polar axes
and parallel to the equatorial pentagon planes. It also
results in 20 triangular
interweavings, which structuring stabilizes the system.

 Instead of having cables connecting the ends of the
struts to the ends of the
next adjacent struts in the six-axes-of-symmetry tensegrity
structure, 60 short cables may
be led from the ends of each prestressed strut either
to the midpoint of the next adjacent
strut or to the midpoint of tension lines running from
one end to the other of each
compression strut. Each of the two ends of the 30 spherical-chord
compression struts
emerges as an energy action? out over the center of
action-and-reaction-effort vectors of
the next adjacent strut, at which midpoint the impinging
strut's effort is angularly
precessed to its adjacent struts. Thus each strut precessionally
transfers its effort and
relayed interloadings to the next two adjacent struts.
This produces a dynamically
regenerative, self-interweaving basketry in which each
compression strut is precessed
symmetrically outwardly from the others while simultaneously
precessing inwardly the
force efforts of all the tensional network.

 In this pattern of six separate, five-strut-membered
pentagons, the six
pentagonal, unsubstanced, but imaginable planes cut
across each other equiangularly at the
spheric center. In such a structure, we witness the
cosmic principles that make possible the
recurrence of locally regenerative structural patterns.
We are witnessing here the
principles cohering and regenerating the atoms. The
struts are simple, dynamic, energy-
event vectors that derive their regenerative energies
from an eternally symmetrical
interplay of inbound-outbound forces of systems that
interfere with one another to
maintain critical fall-in, shunt-out proximities to
one another.

 All polyhedra may be subdivided into component tetrahedra.
Every
tetrahedron has four vertexes, and every cube has eight
vertexes. Every cube contains two
tetrahedra (ABCD and WXYZ). Each of its faces has two
diagonals, the positive set and
the negative set. These may be called the symmetrically
juxtaposed positive and negative
tetrahedra, whose centers of volume are congruent with
one another as well as congruent
with the center of volume of the cube. It is possible
to stack cubes into two columns. One
column can demonstrate the set of positive tetrahedra,
and the other column can
demonstrate the set of negative tetrahedra.

 In every tetrahedron, there are four radials from
the center of volume to the
four vertexes. These radials provide a model for the
behavior of compression members in
a column of tensegrity-stacked cubes. Vertical tension
stays connect the ends of the
tetrahedral compression members, and they also connect
the successive centers of volume
of the stacked spheres<SUP>&#95;&#95;</SUP>the centers of volume being also
the junction of the tetrahedral
radials. As the two centers of volume are pulled toward
one another by the vertical tension
stays, the universally jointed radials are thrust outwardly
but are finitely restrained by the
sliding closure XYZW interlinking the tetrahedral integrities
of the successive cubes.

 This system is inherently nonredundant, as are all
discontinuous-
compression, continuous-tension tensegrity structures.
The approximately horizontal
slings cannot come any closer to one another, and the
approximately vertical stays cannot
get any farther from one another; thus they comprise
a discrete-pattern, interstabilizing
relationship, which is the essential characteristic
of a structure.

 Stacked columns of "solidly," i.e., compressionally
continuous and only
compressionally combined, cubes demonstrate the simultaneous
employment of both
positive and negative tensegrities. Because both the
positive and the negative tensegrity
mast are independently self-supporting, either one provides
the same overall capability. It
is a kind of capability heretofore associated only with
"solid" compressional struts, masts,
beams, and levers<SUP>&#95;&#95;</SUP>that is, either the positive- or the
negative-tensegrity "beam-boom-
mast" longitudinal structural integrity has the same
capability independently as the two of
them have together. When the two are combined, either
the positive- or the negative-
tensegrity set, whichever is a fraction stronger than
the other, it is found experimentally,
must be doing all the strut work at any one time. The
unemployed set is entirely
superfluous, ergo redundant. All "solid" structuring
is redundant.

 If the alternate capabilities of the positive and
negative sets are
approximately equal, they tend to exchange alternately
the loading task and thus generate
an oscillating interaction of positive vs. negative
load transferral. The energies of their
respective structural integrities tend to self-interdeterioration
of their combined,
alternating, strut-functioning longevity of structural
capability. The phenomenon
eventually approaches crystallization. All the redundant
structures inherently accelerate
their own destruction in relation to the potential longevity
of their nonredundant tensegrity
counterparts.

 It is obvious that each of the seemingly "solid" compression
struts in
tensegrity island complexes could be replaced by miniature
tensegrity masts. There is
nothing to keep us from doing this but technological
techniques for operating at
microlevels. It is simply that each of the struts gets
smaller: as we look at each strut in the
tensegrity mast, we see that we could make another much
smaller miniature tensegrity
mast to replace it. Every time we can see a separate
strut and can devise means for making
a tensegrity strut of that overall size, we can substitute
it for the previously "solid" strut.
By such a process of progressive substitutions in diminishing
order of sizes, leading
eventually via sub-sub-sub-miniaturizing tensegrities
to discovery of the last remaining
stage of the seemingly "solid" struts, we find that
there is a minimum "solid-state" strut's
column diameter, which corresponds exactly with two
diameters of the atoms of which it
is constructed. And this is perfectly compatible, because
discontinuity characterizes the
structuring of the atoms. The atom is a tensegrity,
and there are no "solids" left in the
entire structural system. We thus discover that tensegrity
structuring and its omnirationally
constituted regularities are cosmically a priori, disclosing
that Universe is not redundant. It
is only humanity's being born ignorant that has delayed
all of humanity's escape from the
self-annihilating effect of the omniredundance now characterizing
most of humanity's
activities.

 There are no solids in structures. Ergo, there are
no solids in Universe.
There is nothing incompatible with what we may see as
"structure" at the superficial level
and what we are finding out to be the structural relationships
in nuclear physics. It is just
that we did not have the information when yesterday
we built so solidly. This eliminates
any further requirement of the now utterly obsolete
conception of "solid" anything as
intervening in the man-tuned sensorial ranges between
the macro- and micro-world of
ultra- and infrasensorial integrity. We have tensegrity
constellations of stars and tensegrity
constellations of atoms, and they are just Milky Way-like
star patterns of relative spaces
and critical proximities.

 The progressive subdivision of a given metal fiber
into a plurality of fibers
provides tensile capabilities of the smaller fibers
at increased magnitudes up to hundreds
and thousandsfold that of the originally considered
unit section. This is because of the
increased surface-to-mass ratios and because all tensile
capability of structure is inherently
invested in the external beginnings of structural systems,
which are polyhedra, with the
strength enclosing the microcosm that the structural
system inwardly isolates.

 Geodesic tensegrity spheres are capable of mathematical
treatment in such a
manner as to multiply the frequency of triangular modular
subdivision in an orderly
second-power progression. As relative polyhedral size
is diminished, the surface decreases
at a velocity of the second power of the linear-dimension
shrinkage, while the system
volume decreases at a velocity of the third power. Weight-per-surface
area relates directly
to the surface-to-volume rate of linear-size decrease
or increase.

 The higher the frequency, the greater the proportion
of the structure that is
invested in tensional components. Tensional components
are unlimited in length in
proportion to their cross-section diameter-to-length
ratios. As we increase the frequency,
each tension member is parted into a plurality of fibers,
each of whose strength is
multiplied many times per unit of weight and section.
If we increase the frequency many
times, the relative overall weight of structures rapidly
diminishes, as ratioed to any linear
increase in overall dimension of structure.
