 If the frequency is high enough, the size of the interstices
of the tensegrity
net may become so relatively small as to arrest the
passage of any phenomena larger than
the holes. If the frequency is high enough, neither
water nor air molecules can pass
through. The geodesic tensegrity may be designed to
keep out the weather complex while
admitting radar's microwaves and light from the Sun.

 If we raise the structural-system frequency sufficiently,
we will decrease the
residual compression islands to the microcosmic magnitude
of atoms, which only serves to
disclose that the atoms and their nuclei are themselves
geodesic tensegrity structures,
ergo, compatible with this ultimate frequency limit<SUP>&#95;&#95;</SUP>a
fact that is now, in the 1960s and
`70s, swiftly looming into the nuclear physicist's ken.

 We now comprehend that geodesic tensegrity structuring
provides the first
true and visualizable model of pneumatic structures
in which the relative thickness of the
enclosing films, in proportion to diameter, rapidly
decreases with the increasing size of the
balloons or spheric networks.

 In the case of geodesic tensegrity structures, no
overcrowding of interior gas
molecules, imprisoned within a submolecular mesh net,
is necessary to thrust the net's
structure outward from its spherical geometric center,
because the compressional struts,
locally islanded, as outward-thrusting struts at both
their ends, push the spherical net
outwardly at every vertexial advantage of network convergence.
Geodesic tensegrities are
the "hollowed-out" balloons discarding their redundantly
"solid" air core.

 The geodesic tensegrity is a hollowed-out balloon
in which those specific
molecules of gas that happen to be impinging from within
against the skin at any one
moment (thus pushing it outwardly) are replaced by the
islanded geodesic struts, and all
other redundant molecules are discarded. It is possible
to sew pockets on the inside
surface of a balloon skin corresponding in pattern to
the islanded tensegrity geodesic strut-
end positions and to insert into those pockets stiff
battens that cause the otherwise limp
balloon bag to take spherical shape, as it would if
filled with a pressured-in gas.

 Local stiffeners of skin suitable to preferred activities,
at any structural
focus, can be had by increasing the inward-outward angular
strut depths and the local-
surface-frequency patternings-thus thickening the truss
depth without weight penalties.
Here we have nature's own trick of local stiffening
as accomplished by the higher-
frequency, closest-packing pattern of isotropically
moduled local cartilages, and even
higher-frequency local bone structuring, as ratioed
to the frequency of tissue cells of
animal flesh.

 If we employ hydraulic pressure within the local islands
of compression for
dimensional stability, and if we employ gas molecules
between the liquid molecules for
local shock-load compressibility (ergo, flexibility),
we will find that our geodesic
tensegrity structures will in every way have taken advantage
of the same structural-
strategy principles employed by nature in all her sizes
of biological formulations.

 Geodesic tensegrities are true pneumatic structures
in purest design
frequency principle. They obviate the randomness and
redundance characterizing the work
of designers dealing only with pneumatics who happen
to be successful in blowing air into
a bladder while being utterly dependent upon the subvisible
behaviors of chemical
phenomena. Geodesic tensegrity engineering enables discrete
separation of all the
structural events into two diametrically opposed magnitude
classes: all the outward-bound
phenomena which are too large to pass through all the
interstices of all the inward-bound
events in the too-small class. This is the same kind
of redundancy that occurs in reinforced
concrete which, if drilled out wherever redundant components
exist, would disclose an
orderly four-prime-magnitude complex octahedron-tetrahedron
truss network,
disencumbered of more than 50 percent of its weight.

 Tensegrity geodesic spheroids have none of the portal
pressure-lock
problems of "solid-oozing" pneumatic balloons. The pressure
is discretely localized and
locked in place by the tension net, and therefore it
cannot escape.

 Tensegrity geodesic spheroids may have several frequencies
simultaneously<SUP>&#95;&#95;</SUP>a low-frequency major web and a high-frequency
minor local web. If
they are of sufficiently high frequency of secondary
or minor webbing to exclude
atmospheric molecules, they may be partially vacuumized;
that is, they may be made air-

 People think spontaneously of a balloon as a continuous
skin or solidly
impervious unitary and spherically enclosed membrane
holding the gas. They say that
because the gas cannot get out and because it is under
pressure, the pressure makes the
balloon spheroidal. This means that the gas is pushing
the skin outwardly in all directions.
People think of a solid mass of air jammed into a pneumatic
bag. But if we look at this
skin with a microscope, we find that it is not a continuous
film at all; it is full of holes. It is
made up of molecules that are fairly remote from one
another. It is in reality a great energy
aggregate of Milky Way-like atomic constellations cohering
only gravitationally to act as
the invisible, tensional integrities of the fibers with
which the webbing of the pneumatic
balloon's net is woven.

 In a gas balloon, we do not have a continuous membrane
of film. There is no
such thing as a continuous "solid" skin or a "solid"
or a "continuous" anything in
Universe. What we do have is a network pattern, a network
of energy actions interspersed
with vast spaces or lack of energy events. The mass-interattracted
atomic components not
only are not touching each other, but they are as remote
from one another as are Sun and
its planets in the relative terms of respective diameters
of each of the phenomena involved.

 The spaces between the energy-action-net components
are smaller, however,
than are the internally captivated and mutually interrepelled
gas molecules; wherefore the
gas molecules, which are complex low-frequency energy
events, interfere with the higher-
frequency, omnienclosing net-webbing energy events.
The pattern is similar to that of fish
crowded in a spherical net and therefore running tangentially
outward into the net in
approximately all directions. Fish caught in nets produce
an enclosure-frustrated, would-
be escape pattern. In the tensegrities, you have gravity
or electromagnetism producing the
ultimate tension forces, but you don't have any strings
or ultimately smallest solid threads.
The more we think about it and the more we experiment,
the less reliable becomes our
concept "solid." The balloon is indeed not only full
of holes, but it is in fact utterly
discontinuous. It is a net and not a bag. In fact, it
is a spherical galaxy of critically
neighboring energy events.

 The balloon is a net in which the holes are so small
that the molecules are
larger than the holes and therefore cannot get out.
The molecules are gas, but they have a
minimum dimension, and they cannot get out of the holes.
The next thing that we discover
is the pressure of the gases explained by their kinetics.
That is, the molecules are in
motion; they are not rigid. There is nothing static
at all pushing against the net. They are
hitting it like projectiles. All of the molecules of
gas are trying to get out of the system:
this is what gives it the high pressure. The middle
of the chord of an arc is always nearer
to the center of the sphere than the ends of the chord.
Chord ends are always pushing the
net outwardly from the system's spherical center. The
molecules are stretching the net
outwardly until the skin acts to resist the outward
motion and relaxes inwardly. The skin is
finite and closes back upon itself in apparently all
circumferential directions. The net
represents a tensional force with the arrows bound inwardly,
balancing all the molecules,
hitting them, caroming around, with every molecular
action having its chordal reaction.
But the molecules do not huddle together at the center
and then simultaneously explode
outward to hit the balloon skin in one omnidirectionally
outbound wave. Not only are
there critical proximities that show up physically,
but there are critical proximities
tensionally and critical proximities compressionally<SUP>&#95;&#95;</SUP>that
is, there are repellings.

 What makes the net take the shape that it does is
simply the molecules that
happen to hit it. The molecules that are not hitting
it have nothing to do with its shape.
There is potential that other molecules might hit the
network, but that is not what we are
talking about. The shape it has is by virtue of the
ones that happen to hit it.

 When we crowd the gassy molecules into a container,
they manifest action,
reaction, and resultant. When one molecule goes out
to hit the net, it is also pushing
another molecule inwardly or in some other direction.
We discover mathematically that it
would be impossible to get all of them to go to an absolute
common center because that
would require a lot more pressure. It would have to
be a smaller space so the patterns are
not all from the center outwardly against the bag. Each
one of the patterns is ricocheting
around the bag; some are hitting the net and some are
only interfering with and precessing
each other and changing angles without hitting the net.

 The molecules near the surface of the net are coursing
in chordally
ricocheting great-circle patterns around the net's inner
surface. Because every action has
its reaction, it would be possible to pair all the molecules
so that they would behave as, for
instance, two swimmers who dive into a swimming tank
from opposite ends, meet in the
middle, and then, employing each other's inertia, shove
off from each other's feet in
opposite directions. We have an acceleration effectiveness
equal to what they experience
when shoving off from the tank's "solid" wall. When
you are swimming, you dive from
one end of the tank, which gives you a little acceleration
into the water. When you get to
the end of the tank, you can put up your feet, double
up your body, and shove off from the
wall again. Likewise, two swimmers can meet in the middle
of the tank, double up their
bodies, put the soles of their feet together, and thrust
out in opposite directions. The
phenomenon is similar to the discontinuous compression
and continuous tension of
geodesics. The molecules are in motion and have to have
some kind of a reaction set; each
molecule caroming around, great-circularly hitting glancing
blows, then making a chord
and then another glancing blow, has to have another
molecule to shove off from. They are
the ones that are accounting for all the work. Each
one would have to be balanced as a
balanced pair of forces. We discover that all we are
accounting for can be paired. So there
is a net of arrows outwardly in the middle of the chord
pulling against the net of arrows
pointing inwardly.

 The pattern indicates that we could have each and
all of the paired molecules
bounce off their partners and dart away in opposite
directions, with each finally hitting the
balloon net and pushing it outwardly as they each angled
in glancing blows in new
directions, but always toward the net at another point
where, in critical repelling
proximities, they would all pair off nonsimultaneously
but at high frequency of re-
repellment shove-offs to ricochet off the net at such
a high frequency of events as to keep
the net stretched outwardly in all directions. This
represents what the molecules of balloon
confined gases are doing. With discontinuous compression
and continuous tension, we can
make geodesic structures function in the same way.

 As we find out in electromagnetics where there are
repellings and domains of
actions, the kinetic actions of these gas molecules
seem to require certain turning-radius
magnitudes. When you pressure too many of these patterns
into the same area, there is not
enough room to avoid interferences, and they develop
a very high speed. Increased speed
decreases interference probability caused by increased
crowding.

 Airplanes in the sky seem to be great distances apart.
But the minute they
come in for a landing, they are slowed down and are
very much closer to each other. If
you have phenomena at very high speeds, their amount
of time at any one point is a very
short time: the amount of time there would be at a given
point for something to hit it
would be very much lessened by the speed. The higher
the velocity, the lesser the
possibility of interference at any one point. So we
have the motion patterns of the
molecules making themselves more comfortable inside
the balloon by increasing their
velocity, thereby reducing the interferences that are
developing. The velocity then gives us
what we call pressure or heat: it can be read either
way. If you feel the pneumatic bag, you
may find it getting hotter. You can feel an automobile
tire getting hotter as it is pumped
full.
