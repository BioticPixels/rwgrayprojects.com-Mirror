 Among nature's most efficient<SUP>&#95;&#95;</SUP>and therefore most beautiful<SUP>&#95;&#95;</SUP>designs
are
the structuring of the great trees. To examine the structural
effectiveness of trees we can
make an experiment. Take two suitcases, each weighing
50 pounds, one in each hand. Try
to hold them out horizontally at arm's length. It is
easy for our arms to hang them
vertically from our shoulders, but the more horizontally
they are held, the more difficult. It
is almost impossible to hold out 50 pounds horizontally.
Yet look at a tree's shoulders
where the branches are attached. Look at the branch
of a tree with the same girth as that
of your shoulder when your arm is extended and flexed.
Such a tree branch may weigh
500 pounds<SUP>&#95;&#95;</SUP>ten times what you can hold out horizontally.
Many larger-shouldered tree
branches weighing five tons and more are held out horizontally.
"Wing root" is an
aeronautical engineering term for shoulder<SUP>&#95;&#95;</SUP>that is,
where the plane's airframe fuselage
joins the jet-pod-carrying aluminum wing. These air
transport wing roots accomplish great
load-bearing tasks with very low weight ratios. The
way trees hold out five-ton branches
while yielding in streamline and flexing gracefully
without breaking in great winds is a
design accomplishment unparalleled in aeronautical engineering<SUP>&#95;&#95;</SUP>even
in the wing roots
of jumbo jets and supersonic fighters. How can a tree
do that? Biological structures cope
hydraulically with all compressional loadings.

 The paramount function of trees is to expose as much
leafage as possible
under varying wind conditions in order to impound Sun
radiation. By a complex of
relationships with other biologicals, this impoundment
supports life on our planet, since
few mammals can directly convert Sun energy into life
support. Since the function of trees
requires maximum leafage exposure, their progeny will
prosper best when planted outside
the shadow of the parent. Each tree seed is a beautiful
flying machine designed to ride the
wind until reaching propitious soil. Because few seeds
will find propitious sites in this
random distribution, the tree launches many thousands
of seeds. The seeds contain the
geometric design instructions for associating the locally
available resources of air and
water and the atomic chemistries of the locally available
soil and rock in the environs of
seed-landing.

 Seeds contain coded programs for associating local
atoms in triple-bonded
crystal structures. Triple-bonded structures have high
tensile capabilities, and when further
interbonded they produce long, overlapping, fibrous
sacs to be filled with local water and
air derivatives. These closepacked, liquid-filled fibrous
sacs compound first to produce the
"wood" of the tree's roots and trunk. What nature ships
in the seeds are the DNA-RNA
coded instructions on how to utilize the resources of
the locally occurring water, gases,
and chemical elements at the planting site. The high-tensile
fiber sacs are filled with liquid
sap developed from water brought in from the roots by
osmosis. By one-way capillary
valving the hydrogen and oxygen of the water combine
with the carbon- and oxygen-laden
gases of the atmosphere to produce the hydrocarbon crystal
cells of the tree while at the
same time giving off to the atmosphere oxygen atoms
with which the growth of mammals
will be respiratorially sustained.

 Enormous amounts of water are continuously being elevated
through the
one-way, antigravity valving system. The tree feeds
the rain-forming atmosphere by
leaking atomized water out through its leaves while
at the same time sucking in fresh
water through its roots. The tree's high-tensile fiber
cell sacs are everywhere full of liquid.
Liquids are noncompressible; they distribute their local
stress loadings evenly in all
directions to all the fiber cell sacs. The hydraulic
compression function firmly fills out the
predesigned overall high-tensile fiber shaping of the
tree. In between the liquid molecules
nature inserts tiny gaseous molecules that are highly
compressible and absorb the tree's
high-shock loadings, such as from the gusts of hurricanes.
The branches can wave wildly,
but they rarely break off unless they are dehydratively
dying<SUP>&#95;&#95;</SUP>which means they are losing
the integrity of their hydraulic, noncompressible load-distribution
system. Sometimes in an
ice storm the tree freezes so that the liquids cannot
distribute their loads; then the branches
break off and fall to the ground.

 In trees the liquids distribute the loads and the
gases absorb the shocks in an
overall high-tension crystalline fiber network predesigned
by the DNA-RNA
programming. The system transmits its hydraulic load-distribution
impulses through each
liquid-filled cell's contacts with adjacent liquid-loaded
sacs. Starting with one tetrahedral
bud "shoot," the tree grows as a series of concentric
tetrahedral cones. Revolved
tetrahedra generate cones. The constant reorienting
of the direction from which the Sun
radiation is coming, the frequent shift in the wind
direction, and the consequent drag
forces on the tetra-tree produce a conic revolution
effect on the tree growth. Each year a
new cambium layer cone grows over the entire outside
of the previous year's tetra-cone.
Each branch of the tree also starts as a tetrahedral
shoulder cone sprouting out of the main
tree cone.

 This high-tension sac's web design with its hydraulic
compression coping
and pneumatic shock absorbing is much the same structural
system nature employs in the
design of human beings. To be sure, with humans the
liquid does not freeze under normal
environmental conditions; nature creates a good-health
temperature control of 98.6
degrees F. for all its humans. Instead of the larger
tetra cone form, over which the tree
builds from the roots outward into its successive live
layers, nature introduced in the
mobile mammals the skeleton around which all their hydraulically
actuated muscles and
cushioning cells are grown in crystalline patterns as
scheduled by the DNA-RNA program
and as thereafter automated by genetic coding.

 When humans tried to make solid crystalline machinery
and ship it from here
to there over the ground, the objects could move only
very slowly without being
shattered. So pneumatic tires were put on the wheels
so as to distribute the working loads
throughout all the freely moving compressional molecules,
which in turn distribute the
workload energies over the whole uniformly tensioned
surface of the high-tensile tire
casing. The aeronautical engineers finally adopted nature's
biological structuring strategies
to cope with 150 tons of fully loaded jumbo jets coming
out of the sky to land at 150 miles
per hour<SUP>&#95;&#95;</SUP>with the music going and the people putting
on their coats, paying no attention
to the extraordinary engineering accomplishment. The
plane's tires are pneumatic. Rubber
makes the first contact. Pneumatics take the shock load.
Next the hydraulic struts
distribute the shock loading evenly through metered
orifices, and all the shock load energy
is thereafter distributed as heat through the high conductivity
aluminum walls of the
hydraulic system. The heat is completely dispersed by
the metal surfaces. Only in the
landing gear of great airplanes have humans employed
nature's really beautiful structuring
of crystalline tension in complement with hydraulic
compression and pneumatic elasticity
for shock absorption.

 The great structural systems of Universe are accomplished

compression and omnicontinuous tension. <I>Tensegrity</I> is
a contraction of <I>tensional

structures, whether the tension-
islanded compression differentiations are visible to
the observer or not. Tensegrity
geodesic spheres do what they do because they have the
properties of hydraulically or

 Pneumatic structures<SUP>&#95;&#95;</SUP>such as footballs<SUP>&#95;&#95;</SUP>provide a firm
shape when inflated
because the kinetically accelerated atmospheric molecules
are trying to escape and are
impinging outwardly against the skin, stretching outwardly
into whatever accommodating
roundness has been designed into the omniembracing tension
system. (Compare Sec.
 <A HREF="p5100.html#760.00">760</A>.)
When more molecules are introduced into the enclosure
by an air pump, their
overcrowding increases the pressure. A fleet of ships
maneuvering under power needs
more sea room than does another fleet of ships moored
side by side. The higher the speed
of the individual ship, the greater the minimum turning
radius and the more sea room
required. This means that the enclosed and pressurized
molecules in pneumatic structural
systems are accelerated in outward-bound paths by the
addition of more molecules by the
pump; without additional room each must move faster
to get out of the way of the others.

 Pressurized liquid or gaseous molecules try to escape
from their confining
enclosure. When a football is kicked on one outside
spot the outward-bound molecules
impact evenly on the entire inside surface of the football's
flexible skin. The many
outward-bound impactings force the skin outwardly and
firmly in all directions; the faster
the molecules move, the more powerful their impact,
and the harder and more resilient the
football. The effect is dynamic; there is no firm or
static condition. The outward forces are
met by the compressive embracement of the tensile envelope
enclosure.

 The conventional engineering profession has been analyzing
geodesics
strictly in terms of compression, on a crystalline,
non-load-distributing, "post and lintel"
basis. For this reason the big geodesic domes erected
so far have been many times
overbuilt, way beyond the appropriate safety factor
of 2 :1 as adopted by aeronautical
science. The building business uses safety factors of
5 or 6:1. The greater the ignorance of
the art, the greater the safety factor demanded by probability
mathematics. The greater the
safety factor, the greater the redundance and the less
the freedom of load distribution.

 We have a mathematical phenomenon known as a geodesic.
A geodesic is
the most economical relationship between any two events.
A special case geodesic finds
that a seemingly straight line is the shortest distance
between two points in a plane.
Geodesic lines are the shortest surface distances between
two points on the outside of a
sphere. Spherical great circles are geodesics.

 A great circle is a line formed on the surface of
a sphere by a plane passing
through the sphere's center. The Earth's equator is
a great-circle geodesic; so too are the
Earth's meridians of longitude. Any two great circles

 The great-circle chords of all polyhedra are always
found to be
systematically developed out of sets of exactly six
great-circle chords<SUP>&#95;&#95;</SUP>never more or less.
These six vectors are the six vectors of the energy
quantum. The 12 vector-edged chords
of the octahedron equal the two sets of six chord vectors:
two quanta. The 30 vector-
edged chords of the icosahedron equal the five sets
of six chord vectors: five quanta. In
the tetrahedron one quantum of structurally invested
energy encloses one unit of volume.
In the octahedron one quantum of structurally invested
energy encloses two units of
volume. In the icosahedron one quantum of energy invested
in structure encloses almost
four units of volume. Of the three prime structural
systems of Universe, the tetrahedron is
the strongest per unit of volume enclosed; the octahedron
is "middling"; and the
icosahedron is least strong, but encloses the greatest
volume per unit of invested energy.
Whenever nature uses the icosahedron, the maximum volume
enclosure per units of
invested energy is the principal function served. For
this reason all pneumatic and
hydraulic structuring of nature employs icosahedral
spherical geometry. When maximum
structural strength per unit of invested energy is the
principal function served, nature uses
the tetrahedron. When the principal function to be served
is a balance of strength and
volume, nature uses the octahedron as her preferred
structural system.

The triangles, being dynamically

 In the geodesic tensegrity sphere each of the entirely
independent,
compressional-chord struts represents two oppositely
directioned and force paired
molecules. The paired-outward caroming of the two chord
ends produces a single radially
outward force of each chord strut. The tensegrity compressional
chords do not touch one
another: they operate independently, each trying to
escape outwardly from the sphere, but
they are restrained by the spherical tensional integrity's
closed-network system of great-
circle connectors, which alone can complete the great-circle
paths between the ends of the
entirely separate, non-directly-interconnecting, compressional
chords. Were the chordal

clearly that the struts each pull away

 Central angles of great circles are defined by two
radii, the outer ends of
which are connected by both an arc and a chord<SUP>&#95;&#95;</SUP>which
arc and chord are directly
proportional to each unique such central angle. The
chord and two radii form an isosceles
triangle. The distance between the mid-arc and the mid-chord
is called the <I>arc altitude.</I>
Every point on a great-circle arc is at full-radius
distance from the sphere's center. In
developing the triangular subgridding of the icosahedral
geodesic prime structural system,
the greatcircle arc edges of the icosahedron (each of
which has a central angle of 63
degrees, 26 minutes, and several seconds) are equally
subdivided into two, three, or four
equal-arc increments<SUP>&#95;&#95;</SUP>or as many more equal-arc increments
as the engineering
calculation finds desirable in consideration of all
the optional variables, such as the
diameter of the structure, the structural properties
of the materials with which it is to be

 Because each islanded compression strut in a tensegrity
sphere addresses its
adjacent (but untouched) struts at an angle of approximately
60 degrees, that strut is
aimed at but does not reach the midpoints of the adjacent
struts. Each of the struts is a
chord of the sphere, with its ends at greater distance
from the center of the sphere than the
radial distance of the midpoint of the chordal strut-that
difference in distance being exactly
that of the arc altitude. The arc altitude decreases
as the system frequency is increased,
which occurs logically as the system radius increases.

 The mid-girth of each chordal compression strut is
proportional to its length
and is always substantial. The strut is most efficient
when cigar-shaped and pin-ended. As
the frequency increases and the arc altitude decreases,
there develops a special size
geodesic sphere, wherein<SUP>&#95;&#95;</SUP>employing the most economical
material for the struts<SUP>&#95;&#95;</SUP>the
mid-girth of the chordal strut is exactly the same as
the arc altitude, at which point the pin-
ends of the struts approaching at 60 degrees may exactly
touch the mid-girths of the
impinged-upon struts. But this kind of touching does
not mean pushing against, because
the struts (as their tension slings show) are trying
to escape radially outward from the
dome center. What this touching does is to dampen the
vibratory resonance of the
tensegrity sphere.

 One of the impressive behavioral characteristics of
tensegrity spheres,
witnessed at low frequencies, is that when any two islanded
struts 180 degrees apart
around the sphere are pulled outwardly from one another,
the whole sphere expands
symmetrically. When the same two 180-degrees-apart struts
are pushed toward one
another, the whole sphere contracts symmetrically. When
the polar pulling apart or
pushing together ceases, the tensegrity sphere assumes
a radius halfway between the radii
of the most pullingly expandable and pushingly contractable
conditions; that is, it will rest
in dynamic equilibrium.

 When the tension-member lengths between the islanded
struts are
everywhere the same, the twanging of any of them sounds
the same vibration note as any
and all the others. Tightening any one tension member
or increasing the length of any one
strut tightens the whole system uniformly, as is tunably
demonstrable. The equilibrium
state, which tensegrity spheres spontaneously assume,
is the state wherein all the parts are
most comfortable but are always subject to spherical
oscillatability. Thus the coming into
contact of the pin-end cigar struts with the neighboring
struts' mid-girth points provides a
condition at which<SUP>&#95;&#95;</SUP>if the pin-point is locked to the
mid-strut<SUP>&#95;&#95;</SUP>it will be prevented from
leaving its most energetically efficient state of repose,
and the locking together will
prevent either the expansion or contraction of the sphere
and will mute its resonance and
deaden its springiness.

 At the low-frequency, push-pull, contraction-expansion
susceptible state,
tensegrity spheres act like basketballs. Bouncing them
against the floor makes them
contract locally, after which they spring back powerfully
to their original shape, which
impels them back against gravity. Geodesic spheres are

 We can take advantage of the fact that lumber cut
at the "two-by-four" size
represents the lumber industry's most frequently used
and lowest-cost structural lumber.
The average length of the two-by-fours is 12 feet. We
can take the approximately two-
inch dimension as the mid-girth size of a strut, and
we can use an average of 10-foot
lengths of the tensilely strongest two-by-four wood
worked by the trade (and pay the
premium to have it selected and free of knotholes).
We can then calculate what size of the
spherical dome<SUP>&#95;&#95;</SUP>and what frequency<SUP>&#95;&#95;</SUP>will produce the condition
of "just-kissing" contact
of the two-by-four ends of the islanded two-by-four
chordal struts with the mid-girth
contact points of one another. This calculates out to
a 12-frequency, 72-foot-diameter
sphere that, if truncated as a three-quarter sphere,
has 20 hexagonal openings around its
base, each high enough and wide enough to allow the
passage of a closed body truck.

 We calculated and produced such a 72-foot, three-quarter-sphere
geodesic
dome at the Edwardsville campus of Southern Illinois
University in 1962. The static load
testing of all the parts as well as the final assembly
found it performing exactly as
described in the above paragraphs. The static load testing
demonstrated performance on
the basis of the load-distributing capabilities of pneumatics
and hydraulics and exceeded
those that would have been predicted solely on the basis
of continuous compression.

 As the world's high-performance metallic technologies
are freed from
concentration on armaments, their structural and mechanical
and chemical performances
(together with the electrodynamic remote control of
systems in general) will permit
dimensional exquisiteness of mass-production-forming
tolerances to be reduced to an
accuracy of one-hundredth-thousandths of an inch. This
fine tolerance will permit the use
of hydraulically pressure-filled glands of high-tensile
metallic tubing using liquids that are
nonfreezable at space-program temperature ranges, to
act when pressurized as the
discontinuously isolated compressional struts of large
geodesic tensegrity spheres. Since
the fitting tolerances will be less than the size of
the liquid molecules, there will be no
leakage. This will obviate the collapsibility of the
air-lock-and-pressure-maintained
pneumatic domes that require continuous pump-pressurizing
to avoid being drag-rotated
to flatten like a candle flame in a hurricane. Hydro-compressed
tensegrities are less
vulnerable as liquids are noncompressible.

 Geodesic tensegrity spheres may be produced at enormous
<I>city-enclosing</I>
diameters. They may be assembled by helicopters with
great economy. This will reduce the
investment of metals in large tensegrity structures
to a small fraction of the metals invested
in geodesic structures of the past. It will be possible
to produce geodesic domes of
enormous diameters to cover whole communities with a
relatively minor investment of
structural materials. With the combined capabilities
of mass production and aerospace
technology it becomes feasible to turn out whole rolls
of noncorrosive, flexible-cable
networks with high-tensile, interswaged fittings to
be manufactured in one gossamer piece,
like a great fishing net whose whole unitary tension
system can be air-delivered anywhere
to be compression-strutted by swift local insertions
of remote-controlled, expandable
hydro-struts, which, as the spheric structure takes
shape, may be hydro-pumped to firm
completion by radio control.

 In the advanced-space-structures research program
it has been discovered
that<SUP>&#95;&#95;</SUP>in the absence of unidirectional gravity and atmosphere<SUP>&#95;&#95;</SUP>it
is highly feasible to
centrifugally spin-open spherical or cylindrical structures
in such a manner that if one-half
of the spherical net is prepacked by folding below the
equator and being tucked back into
the other and outer half to form a dome within a dome
when spun open, it is possible to
produce domes that are miles in diameter. When such
structures consist at the outset of
only gossamer, high-tensile, low-weight, spider-web-diameter
filaments, and when the
spheres spun open can hold their shape unchallenged
by gravity, then all the filaments'
local molecules could be chemically activated to produce
local monomer tubes
interconnecting the network joints, which could be hydraulically
expanded to form an
omniintertrussed double dome. Such a dome could then
be retrorocketed to subside
deceleratingly into the Earth's atmosphere, within which
it will lower only slowly, due to
its extremely low comprehensive specific gravity and
its vast webbing surface, permitting
it to be aimingly-landed slowly, very much like an air-floatable
dandelion seed ball: the
multi-mile-diametered tensegrity dome would seem to
be a giant cousin. Such a space-
spun, Earth-landed structure could then be further fortified
locally by the insertion of
larger hydro-struttings from helicopters or rigid lighter-than-air-ships<SUP>&#95;&#95;</SUP>or
even by remote-
control electroplating, employing the atmosphere as
an electrolyte. It would also be
feasible to expand large dome networks progressively
from the assembly of smaller
pneumatic and surface-skinning components.

 The fact that the dome volume increases exponentially
at a third-power rate,
while the structural component lengths increase at only
a fraction more than an
arithmetical rate, means that their air volume is so
great in comparison to the enclosing
skin that its inside atmosphere temperature would remain
approximately tropically
constant independent of outside weather variations.
A dome in this vast scale would also
be structurally fail-safe in that the amount of air
inside would take months to be evacuated
should any air vehicle smash through its upper structure
or break any of its trussing.

all compression will be furnished by the tensionally
contained, antifreeze-treated liquids.
Metals with tensile strengths of a million p.s.i. will

liquids that will remain noncompressible even at a million
p.s.i. Complete shock-load
absorption will be provided by the highly compressible

and

 The data mathematically developed within the three
basic triangles become
constants for spheres of any size. What we need to know
structurally is the length of the
chordal lines between any two adjacent points in the
three-way great-circle grid and the
angles at which they intersect. The spherical surface
angles of the sphere and the central
angles may all be expressed in the same decimal fractions,
which remain constant for any
size sphere since they are fractions of a unit finite

<I>chord factors</I> to all the constant lengths of a sphere's
connecting lines, whether between
any two spherical surface points or between two concentric
spheres that are
intertriangularly trussed. We assign the word <I>frequency</I>

subdivisions of the spherical arc edges of the basic
spherical triangles.

 Competent designing of geodesic tensegrity domes also
requires monitoring
the evolving increases in performance of the various
chemical materials and metal alloys
available. The full design science responsibility includes
developing, prototyping, testing,
production, engineering, tooling, manufacturing, transporting
from factory to use point,
assembly, and removing and recycling of the materials:
only from consideration of each
such successive cycle can we learn how to do it again
more efficiently and satisfactorily to
society.
I.e., 60 degrees. The nucleus of a square would have
a completely different distance to its corners than
the corners would have to each other.
