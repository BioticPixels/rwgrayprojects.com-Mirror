 We can take hold of any two parts of a tensegrity
sphere and treat it as an
omnidirectional, expansion-contraction accordion. In
the same way, we can take hold of
any two parts of a rubber-vectored, isotropic-vector
matrix and, so long as the contiguous
faces of the octahedron-tetrahedron field remain congruent,
the matrix can be distorted by
angular variation, spin, orbit, inside-outing, expansion,
knotting, or torque without losing
any of all the fundamental regularities of the omniconsidered,
allspace-filling set.

 Activated by tension and compression, two remote-from-one-another
external triangles of an elongated isotropic rubber-vectored
matrix structural system may
be congruently associated to close the system's "insideness''
back upon itself to form a
large, flexible structural-system ring with a circularly
closed insideness, like a serpent
biting off its own tail and swallowing the "open" end.

 When the structural system's remote structural parts
are joined back on
themselves to continue the insideness-integrity's division
from the outsideness, the only
"holes" in the system (which may be coupled to join
the insideness back on itself) are
triangular wholes, with their respective three corners
identifiable as A, B, C, and A', B',
C', respectively. They could be nontwistingly joined
A to A`, B to B`, C to C`, or by
twisting the elongated rubber-vectored system's ends
120 degrees, they could be joined as
A to B`, B to C`, C to A`, or twisted more to A to C`,
B to A`, C to B'<SUP>&#95;&#95;</SUP>or they could be
twisted 360 degrees and fastened A to A', B to B', and

 <B>Variability of Spherical Magnitudes:</B> All or partial
differentialing of the
six always-congruent tetrahedron and octahedron edges
of allspace filling also introduces
variation in the size of the spheres that could surround
any one vertex of the system.
Whereas the original isotropic vector matrix, with all
its vector "lines" the same, provided
the set of vertexes that were the centers of unit-radius,
omni-closest-packed spheres, we
now witness experimentally with a stretchable, rubber-vectored,
allspace-filling, originally
unit-edged, triple-bonded complex of tetrahedra and
octahedra, that the whole system may
be stretched, torqued, and angularly wrench-distorted.
Ergo, we witness the ways in which
the vector equilibrium, or most inter-economical vectorial
relationship of 12-around-one
sphere centers in closest packing, may be omnidirectionally
distorted to accommodate a
plurality of spherical magnitudes in an as-yet closest
possible interrelated neighborhood
array of the respective centers of disparate-size spheres,
with some spheres tangent to
their neighbors and others disconnected.

 <B>Isotropic Modular Grid:</B> In the same experimental model
exploring
manner, we discover that whereas locally verifiable
parallel lines running off to the horizon
appear to converge, it becomes a local observational
experience reality that what is
constructed as a many-miles-wide, -high, and -long isotropic
vector matrix of 10-foot
modules, with its vertexes occupied by omniuniform radius
spheres of 10-foot diameters
each, in omniclosest packing, may be photographed or
drawn as seen in perspective from
one locus outside the system. The sizes of the individual
spheres and of the edge lengths
and triangular "areas" are experientially witnessable
as progressively diminishing in size as
they extend, respectively, remote from the observer.
The size variations may be measured
accurately on a viewer's modular-gridded, hairwire-in-glass
screen, mounted vertically,
immediately in front of the viewer. It is also experientially
observable and documentable
that despite these observed progressively diminishing
alterations of relative intersystem
size, the topological-inventory characteristics of relative
abundance of vertexes, faces,
edges, A and B Modules, and the sum total of angles
around the vertexes<SUP>&#95;&#95;</SUP>all remain
unaltered.

 <B>Time as Relative Size Experience:</B> Local variability
within total order
synergetically explains and defines the experience ``time,"
which is relative size
experience. The magnitude of the event characteristics
is always accounted in respect to
other time cycles of experiences. The cosmically permitted
and experientially
accommodated actuality of the individual's unique variety
of sensorially differentiated
local in time-space experiences also accommodates the
experienceability in pure principle
of individually unique physical life in concert with
the only metaphysically operative,
cosmically liaisoned, weightless, abstractly conceptual
mind, by means of all of which
physically and metaphysically coordinate experienceable
principles it is experimentally
discoverable how genetic programming accomplishes the
``instinctive" conditioning of
subconscious, brain-monitored, relative pulsation aberration
and transformation controls,
which are all reliably referenced entirely subconsciously
to the eternally undisturbed,
cosmic-coordination regularities unbeknownst to the
individual biological organism
"experience."

 Moebius's arbitrarily shadow-edged strip and Klein's
rimless bottle are only
self-deceptively conceivable as absolute solids or as
absolute continuities with inherently
absolute edges and lines. The Moebius strip does not
have an edge: it is a tube. Lack of
any experimental evidence of any such phenomena as absolute
solids or absolute
continuities with inherently absolute edges and lines
induced physicists to abandon the
concepts of solids and absolute continuities.

 In their bottle and strip propositions, both Klein
and Moebius employ the
working assumption of absolute solids and surface continuums.
The humanly
experienceable surprise qualities of their findings
are the same surprise experiences of
audiences of expert magicians who seem to produce results
by means other than those
which they actually employ. The implied significance
of the bottle and strip findings
vanishes in the presence of the synergetic surprise
of the topological constants of the
vector equilibrium's hierarchical regularities independent
of size, inside-outing, turbining,
and so forth. Unlike Moebius's and Klein's experimentally
undemonstrable constructed
substances, the information input of synergetics and
tensegrity are wedded experientially
only with the full gamut of the thus far published experimental
findings of astrophysics,
chemistry, and microbiology.

 Tensegrity icosahedra provide by far the most volume
with the least
structural effort of the three basic structural systems.
The tetrahedron has the least volume

and the icosahedron gives the most
with the least.

 In the icosahedron, five quanta give twenty units
of enclosed volume, which
means four units of volume for each energy quantum invested
in the enclosing structure.
Whereas in the tetrahedron one quantum will enclose
only one unit of volume. The
octahedron gives two units of volume for each quantum.
Therefore, the icosahedron gives
the most for the least effort.
