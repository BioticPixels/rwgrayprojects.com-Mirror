 The local struts are so oriented that they always
and only angle inwardly and
outwardly between the concentric, differently radiused,
comprehensively finite, exterior
and interior, tensional spherical nets. The result is
an interstabilized dynamic equilibrium of
positive and negative waves of action. Such tensegrity
sphere structures are limited in size
only by the day-to-day limits of industrial production
and service-logistics techniques.
Large tensegrity spheres can have their lower portions
buried in reinforced-concrete as tie-
down bases to secure them against hurricane-drag displacement.

 As we increase the frequency of triangular-module
subdivisions of a
tensegrity geodesic sphere, we thus also increase the
number of compression struts, which
get progressively halved in length, while their volumes
and weights shrink eightfold. At the
same time, the arc altitude between the smaller arcs
and chords of the sphere decreases,
while the compression members get closer and closer
to the adjacent compression
members they cross. Finally, we reach the condition
where the space between the struts is
the same dimension as the girth radius of the struts.
At this point, we can let them kiss-
touch; i.e., with the ends of two converging struts
contacting the top middle of the strut
running diagonally to those two struts and immediately
below their ends. We may then
lock the three kissing members tensionally together
in their kiss, but when we do so, we
must remember that they were not pushing one another
when they "kissed" and we locked
them in that equilibrious, "most comfortable" position
of contact coincidence. Tensegrity
spheres are not fastened in shear, even though their
<I>locked kiss</I> gives a superficially "solid"
continuity appearance that is only subvisibly discontinuous
at the atomic level.

 The terminal junctures of four three-strut tensegrity
octahedra are all 180-
degree junctures. They appear to be compressionally
continuous, while the central
coherence of the three struts appears visibly discontinuous.
The complex tensegrity
presents a visibly deceptive appearance to the unwary
observer. The two joined legs of the
basic units appear as single units; as such, they appear
to be primary elements of the
complex tensegrity, whereas we learn from construction
that our elements are the three-
strut octahedra and that the cohering principle of the
simplest elements is tensegrity.

 Whereas man seems to be blind in employing tensegrity
at his level of
everyday consciousness, we find that tensegrity structures
satisfy our conceptual
requirement that we may not have two events passing
through the same point at the same
time. Vectors converge in tensegrity, but they never
actually get together; they only get
into critical proximities and twist by each other.

 In basic tensegrity structures, the spheric-tension
network system is
completely continuous. The ends of each compression
member connect only with the
tension network at various points on the tensional catenaries
nearest to the respective ends
of the system's omni-islanded compression vector struts.
The tension members running
between the ends of the struts may be double or single.
Double tension members best
distribute the loads and most economically and nonredundantly
accommodate the
omnidistributive stress flows of the system. The catenaries
always yield in obtuse or acute
"V" shapes at their points of contact with the <I>strut</I>
islands of compression.

 Conventional building with continuous compression

 But in tensegrity structures, the tension members
pull away from the
compression strut ends, which the V-shape tension connections
demonstrate. If two
people take positions on opposite sides of a tensegrity
sphere and pull on polarly opposite
struts in opposite directions from one another, it will
be seen that all around the sphere
there is a uniform and symmetrical response to the opposite
pulling (or pushing). Pulling
on two opposite parts makes the whole sphere grow symmetrically
in size, while pushing
forces the whole sphere to shrink contractively and
symmetrically. Cessation of either the
pulling or the pushing causes the sphere to take its
size halfway between the largest and
smallest conditions, i.e., in its equilibrious size.
This phenomenon is a typical four-
dimensional behavior of synergetic intertransforming.
It explains why it is that all local
celestial systems of Universe, being cohered with one
another tensionally, pull on one
another to bring about an omniexpanding physical Universe.

 <B>Micro-Macro Structural Model:</B> If you just tauten one
point in a tensegrity
system, all the other parts of it tighten evenly. If
you twang any tension member anywhere
in the structure, it will give the same resonant note
as the others. If you tauten any one
part, the tuning goes to a higher note everywhere in
the structure. Until its tension is
altered, each tensegrity structure, as with every chemical
element, has its own unique
frequency. In a two-sling tensegrity sphere, every part
is nonredundant. If tension goes up
and the frequency goes up, it goes up uniformly all
over. As tensegrity systems are
tautened, they approach but never attain rigidity, being
nonredundant structures. Anything
that we would call rigid, such as one of the atoms of
a very high integrity pattern, is
explained by this type of tensegrity patterning.

 The kinetically interbalanced behaviors of tensegrity
systems manifest
discretely and elucidate the energy-interference-event
patternings that integrate to form
and cohere all atoms. The tensegrity system is always

the omnipotential-energy phase visually articulate of
the push-pull, in-out-and-around,
pulsating and orbiting, precessionally shunted reangulations,

 The circumferentially islanded tensegrity struts are
energy vectors in action,
and the tension lines are the energy tensors in action.
Their omnisystem interpatterning
shows how the circumferentially orbiting tensegrity
struts' lead ends are pulled by the
center of mass of the next adjacent inwardly positioned
vector strut. The mass attraction
pulls inwardly on the lead ends of the precessionally
articulating, self-orbiting, great-circle
chord vector struts, thus changing their circumferential
direction. They are precessionally
and successively deflected from one tangent course to
the next, circumferentially inward
and onward, tangent vector course. Thus each of the
vectors is successively steered to
encircle the same tensegrity system center. In this
manner, a variety of energy-interference,
kinetic-equilibrium patterns results in a variety of
cosmically local, self-regenerative,
micro-macro structural systems such as atoms or star
systems.

 Tensegrity differentiates out these axial-linears
into separately cofunctioning
compression vectors and tensional tensors. As in many
instances of synergetic behavior,
these differentiations are sometimes subtle. For instance,
there is a subtle difference
between Eulerian topology, which is polyhedrally superficial,
and synergetic topology,
which is nuclear and identifies spheres with vertexes,
solids with faces, and struts with
edges. The subtlety lies in the topological differentiation
of the relative abundance of these
three fundamental aspects whereby people do not look
at the four closest-packed spheres
forming a tetrahedron in the same way that they look
at a seemingly solid stone
tetrahedron, and quite differently again from their
observation of the six strut edges of a
tetrahedron, particularly when they do not accredit
Earth with providing three of the struts
invisibly cohering the base ends of the camera tripod.

 There are physical redundancies when, for instance,
we have a mast stepped
in a hole in the ground and three tensional stays at
120 degrees. When a fourth tension
member is led to an anchor at an equiradiused distance
from the mast base and at one
degree of circular arc away from one of the original
three anchors, we then have two
tension stays running side by side. When the two stays
are thus approximately parallel, we
find it is impossible to equalize the tensions exactly.
One or the other will get the load, not
both .

 It is structural redundancy when a square knot is
tied and an amateur says,
"I'm going to make that stronger by tying more square
knots on top of it." The secondary
knots are completely ineffective because the first square
knot will not yield. There is a
tendency of the second square knot to "work open" and
thus deteriorate the first knot.
Structural redundancies tend to deteriorate the effectiveness
of the primary members.

 Building codes of cities, formulated by politicians
fearful of the calumny of
what may befall them if buildings fall down, ignorantly
insist on doubling the thickness of
walls. Building codes require a safety factor of usually
five, or more, to one.

 Aircraft designing employs a safety factor of two
to one<SUP>&#95;&#95;</SUP>or even no safety
factor at all, while cautioning the pilot through instrumental
indication of when he is
approaching limit condition. The deliberately imposed
safety factors of society's building
conglomerates introduce redundancy breeding redundancy,
wherein<SUP>&#95;&#95;</SUP>as with nuclear
fusion, chain-reacting<SUP>&#95;&#95;</SUP>the additional weights to carry
the additional weights multiply in
such a manner as to increase the inefficiency imposed
by the redundancy at an exponential
rate implicit in Newton's mass-attraction gravitational
law: every time we double the
safety factor, we fourfold the inefficiency and eightfold
the unnecessary weight.

 The original six vector-edge members of the tensegrity
tetrahedron may be
transformed through the tensegrity-octahedron phase
and finally into the tensegrity-
icosahedron phase. The same six members transform their
relation to each other through
the full range of the three (only) fundamental structures
of nature: the tetrahedron, the
octahedron, and the icosahedron. (See Secs.

 <B>Tensegrity Octahedron:</B> The simplest form of tensegrity
is the octahedron
with three compression members crossing each other.
The three compression struts do not
touch each other as they pass at the center. They are
held together only at their terminals
by the comprehensive triangular tension net. The same
three-islanded struts of the
tensegrity octahedron may be mildly reorganized or asymmetrically
transformed.

 The struts may be the same length or of different
lengths. Some tensional
edges may be lengthened while other tensional edges
of the surface triangles are
shortened. The compression members still do not touch
each other. One figure is a
positive and the other a negative tensegrity octahedron.
They can be joined together to
make a new form: the tensegrity icosahedron.

 <B> Six-Strut Tensegrities:</B> Two three-strut tensegrities
may be joined together
to make the tensegrity icosahedron. This form has six
members in three parallel sets with
their ends held together in tension. There are 12 terminals
of the six struts (the two
octahedra<SUP>&#95;&#95;</SUP>each with three struts of six ends<SUP>&#95;&#95;</SUP>combined).
When you connect up these 12
terminals, you reveal the 12 vertexes of the icosahedron.
There are 20 triangles of the
icosahedron clearly described by the tension members
connecting the 12 points in the most
economical omnitriangular pattern.

 In the tensegrity icosahedron, there are six tension
members, which join
parallel struts to each other. If these tension members
are removed from the icosahedron,
only eight triangles remain from the original 20. These
eight triangles are the eight
transforming triangles of the symmetrical contraction
of the vector equilibrium "jitterbug."
(See Sec.
 <A HREF="../s04/p6000.html#460.00">460</A>.)
 Consequently, this "incomplete" icosahedron
demonstrates an expansion-
contraction behavior similar to the "jitterbug," although
pulsing symmetrically inward-
outward within more restricted limits.

 If two opposite and parallel struts are pushed or
pulled upon, all six members
will move inwardly or outwardly, causing the icosahedron
to contract or expand in a
symmetrical fashion. When this structure is fully expanded,
it is the regular icosahedron; in
its contracted state, it becomes an icosahedron bounded
by eight equilateral triangles and
12 isosceles triangles (when the missing six tension
members are replaced). All 12 vertexes
may recede from the common center in perfect symmetry
of expansion or, if concentrated
load is applied from without, the whole system contracts
symmetrically, i.e., all the
vertexes move toward their common center at the same
rate.

 This is not the behavior we are used to in any structures
of our previous
experiences. These compression members do not behave
like conventional engineering
beams. Ordinary beams deflect locally or, if fastened
terminally in tension to their building,
tend to contract the building in axial asymmetry. The
tensegrity "beam" does not act
independently but acts only in concert with "the whole
building," which contracts only
symmetrically when the beam is loaded.

 The tensegrity system is synergetic<SUP>&#95;&#95;</SUP>a behavior of
the whole unpredicted by
the behavior of the parts. Old stone-age columns and
lintels are energetic and only interact
locally with whole buildings. The whole tensegrity-icosahedron
system, when loaded
oppositely at two diametric points, contracts symmetrically,
and because it contracts
symmetrically, its parts get symmetrically closer to
one another; therefore, gravity
increases as of the second power, and the whole system
gets uniformly stronger. This is
the way atoms behave.
