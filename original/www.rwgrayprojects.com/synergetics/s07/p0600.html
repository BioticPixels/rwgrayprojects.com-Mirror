 Engineers and mathematicians both appear presently
to be unfamiliar with
practical means for discretely analyzing and employing
the three-way grids of finitely
closed, great-circle triangulations despite the fact
that their triangular integrities constitute
nature's most powerful and frequently employed structural
systems. You can inform
yourself experimentally regarding the relative structural
effectiveness of flat, simple-
cylinder, and compoundly curved sheet material by taking
a flat piece of paper, standing it
on its edges, and loading that top edge; you will note
that it has no structural strength
whatsoever<SUP>&#95;&#95;</SUP>it just crumples. But if we roll-form the
same piece of paper into a cylinder,
which is what is called simple curvature, we can use
the cylinder as a column in which all
the compressionally functioning lines are parallel to
each other and interact with the
closed-circle tensional strength of the paper cylinder's
outside surface like the staves and
hoops of a barrel.

 But only if we achieve a three-way interaction of
great circles can we arrive
at the extraordinary stability afforded by the omnitensionally
integrated, triangular
interstabilization of compound curvature. This we do
experimentally with the same sheet
of paper, which we now form into a conical shape. Standing
the cone on its finitely closed
circular base and loading its apex, we find it to be
more stable and structurally effective for
supporting a concentrated top loading than was either
the first sheet or the simply curved
cylinder. The top load now thrusts downwardly and outwardly
toward the finitely closed,
tensionally strong base perimeter, which becomes even
stronger if the cone is foldingly
converted into a tetrahedron whose insideness concavity
and outsideness convexity and
omnifinite tensional embracement constitute the prime
manifestation of so-called
"compound curvature."

 In contrast to our simply curved, cylindrical barrel
construction, let us now
make a wooden geodesic sphere in which all of the triangular
facets are external faces of
internally truncated tetrahedra whose interior apexes,
had they not been snubly truncated,
would each have reached the center of the sphere. Each
of the outwardly triangular,
internally truncated, tetrahedral cork's edges is covered
by finitely closed great-circle
tension straps. The steel tension straps are not parallel
to each other but are
omnitriangularly interconnected to form a spherical
barrel. Every great circle of a spherical
cask crosses all other great circles of that sphere
twice. Any two such<SUP>&#95;&#95;</SUP>only polarly
interconnected<SUP>&#95;&#95;</SUP>great circles can hinge upon each other
like a pair of shears. They are
angularly unstable until a third great circle that does
not run through the same crossings of
the other two inherently crosses both of the first two
great circles and, in effect, taking
hold of the lever ends of the other two great circles,
with the least effort accomplishes
stabilization of the oppositely converging angle.

 So we now have an omnitriangulated geodesic sphere
of triangulated
wooden plugs, or hard wooden corks fashioned of the
same barrel stave oak, each one
surrounded by and pressed tightly against three other
such triangular hardwood corks;
each has its exterior triangular facets edged by three
great circles whose lengths are
greater than the respectively corresponding wooden cork
triangle's interior chords so that
none of the wooden corks can fall inwardly. The finitely
closed great-circle straps are
fastened to each other as they cross one another; thus
stably interpositioned by
triangulation, they cannot slip off the sphere; and
none of the wooden triangular corks can
fall in on one another, having greater outer edge lengths
than those of their inner edges.
The whole sphere and its spherical aggregates of omnitriangularly
corked surface
components are held tightly together in an omnitriangulated
comprehensive harness. All of
the great circles are intertriangulated in the most
comfortable, ergo most economical,
interpositions possible.

 If we now take a blowtorch and bum out entirely one
of the triangular,
truncated wooden corks<SUP>&#95;&#95;</SUP>just as we burned out one of
the barrel's wooden
staves<SUP>&#95;&#95;</SUP>unlike the barrel, our sphere will not collapse.
It will not collapse as did the
regular barrel when one stave was burnt out. Why does
it not collapse? Because the three-
way triangular gridding is finitely closed back on itself.
Infinity is not let into the system
except through the finitely-perimetered triangular hole.
The burning out of the triangular,
truncated tetrahedron, hardwood cork leaves only a finite
triangular opening; and a
triangular opening is inherently a stable opening. We
can go on to bum out three more of
the triangular, truncated wooden corks whose points
are adjacent to each other, and while
it makes a larger opening, it remains a triangular opening
and will still be entirely framed
with closed and intertriangulated great circles; hence
it will not collapse. In fact, we find
that we can bum out very large areas of the geodesic
sphere without its collapsing. This
three-way finite crossing of most economical great circles
provides a powerful realization
of the fundamentals of compound curvature. Compound
curvature is inherently self-
triangulating and concave-convexing the interaction
of those triangles around the exterior
vertexes.

the greatest strength
with the least material. It is no aesthetic accident
that nature encased our brains and
regenerative organs in compoundly curvilinear structures.

the shortest distances
around spheres, a <I>single</I> great-circle band around a
sphere will readily slide off. Every
great circle of a sphere must cross other great circles
of that sphere twice, with the
crossings of any two always 180 degrees apart. Since
an infinite number of great circles
may run through any two same points on a sphere 180
degrees apart, and since any <I>two</I>
great-circle bands are automatically self-interpolarizing,
two great-circle bands on a sphere
can rotate equatorially around their mutual axis and
attain congruency, thereafter to act
only as one solitary meridian, and therefore also free
to slide off the sphere. Not until we
have <I>three</I> noncommonly polarized, great-circle bands
providing omnitriangulation as in a
spherical octahedron, do we have the great circles acting
structurally to self-interstabilize
their respective spherical positionings by finitely
intertriangulating fixed points less than
180 degrees apart.

 The more minutely the sphere is subtriangulated by
great circles, the lesser
the local structural-energy requirements and the greater
the effectiveness of the mutual-
interpositioning integrity. This spontaneous structural
self-stabilizing always and only
employs the chords of the shortest great-circle arc
distances and their respective spherical
finiteness tensional integrity.

 When disturbed by energy additions to the system,
the triangular plug
"corks" can only<SUP>&#95;&#95;</SUP>and precessionally "prefer"<SUP>&#95;&#95;</SUP>to be extruded
only outwardly from the
system, like the resultant of all forces of all the
kinetic momentums of gas molecules in a
balloon. The omni-outwardly straining forces of all
the compressional forces are more than
offset by the finitely closed, omni-intertriangulated,
great-circle tensions, each of whose
interstitial lines, being part of a triangle<SUP>&#95;&#95;</SUP>or minimum
structure<SUP>&#95;&#95;</SUP>are inherently
nonredundant. The resultant of forces of all the omni-intertriangulated
great-circle
network is always radially, i.e. perpendicularly, inward.
The tightening of any one great
circle results in an even interdistribution of the greater
force of the inward-outward
balance of forces.

 <B>Fail-Safe Advantages:</B> With each increase of frequency
of triangular
module subdivisions of the sphere's unitary surface,
there is a corresponding increase in
the fail-safe advantage of the system's integrity. The
failure of a single triangular cork in
an omnitriangulated spherical grid leaves a triangular
hole, which, as such, is structurally
innocuous, whereas the failure of one stave in a simple-curvature
barrel admits infinity and
causes the whole barrel to collapse. The failure of
two adjacent triangular corks in a
spherical system leaves a diamond-shaped opening that
is structurally stable and
innocuous; similarly, the failure of five or six triangles
leaves a completely arched, finitely
bound, and tensionally closed pent or hex opening that,
being circumferentially surrounded
by great circles, is structurally innocuous. Failure
of a single spherical-tension member
likewise leaves an only slightly relaxed, two-way detoured,
diamonded relaying of the
throughway tensional continuity. Considerable relaxing
of the spherical, triangulated-cork
barrel system by many local tension failures can occur
without freeing the corks to
dangerously loosened local rotatability, because the
great-circle crossings were
interfastened, preventing the tensionally relaxed enlargement
of the triangular bonds. The
higher the frequency and the deeper the intertrussing,
the more fail-safe is this type of
spherical structure.

 Structural systems encompassing radial compression
and circumferential
tension are accomplished uniquely and exclusively through
three-way spherical gridding.
These radial and circumferential behaviors open a whole
new field of structural
engineering formulations and an elegance of refinement
as the basis for a new tensegrity-
enlightened theory of engineering and construction congruent
with that of Universe.

 Local isolations of "point" fixes, "planes," and "lines"

dependent aspects of larger, often cosmically vast or

 Unfortunately, engineering has committed itself in
the past exclusively to
these locally infinite and inherently indeterminate
systems. As a consequence, engineering
frequently has had to rely only on such trial-and-error-evolved
data regarding local
behaviors as the "rate" of instrumentally measurable
deflection changes progressively
produced in static-load increases, from which data to
evolve curves that theoretically
predict "failure" points and other critical information
regarding small local systems such as
columns, beams, levers, and so forth, taken either individually
or collectively and
opinionatedly fortified with safely "guesstimated" complex
predictions. Not until we
evolve and spontaneously cultivate a cosmic comprehension
deriving from universal,
finite, omnitriangulated, nonredundant structural systems
can we enjoy the advantage of
powerful physical generalizations concisely describing
all structural behaviors.

 When a photograph is made of a plurality of lines
crossing through
approximately one point, it is seen that there is a
blurring or a running together of the lines
near the point, creating a weblike shadow between the
converging lines<SUP>&#95;&#95;</SUP>even though the
individual lines may have been clearly drawn. This is
caused by a refractive bending of the
light waves. When the masses of the physically constituted
lines converge to critical
proximity, the relative impedance of light-wave passage
in the neighborhood of the point
increases as the second power of the relative proximities
as multiplied by a factor of the
relative mass density.

 Tensegrity geodesic spherical structures eliminate
the heavy sections of
compression members in direct contact at their terminals
and thus keep the heavy mass of
respective compressions beyond critical proximities.
As the vertexial connections are
entirely tensional, the section mass is reduced to a
minimum, and system "frequency"
increase provides a cube-root rate of reduction of section
in respect to each doubling
frequency. In this manner, very large or very small
tensegrity geodesic spheroids may be
designed with approximate elimination of all microwave
interferences without in any way
impairing the structural dimensional stability.

 The most outward chord of any given central angle
of a circle is the longest.
The omnicircumferential, triangularly stabilized, interconnecting
tension lines of the
spherical-network system cannot get bigger than its
discretely designed dimensions and
the ultimate tensile strength of the network's tensors,
without bursting its integrity. The
comprehensive spherical-tensor network can only relax
inwardly. When all in place, the
tensegrity-compression struts can only prevent the tension
network from closing inward
toward the sphere's center, which is its comprehensive
proclivity.

 The synergetic force of the struts (that is, their

tendency) is not predicted by any one strut taken singly.
It is entirely omniradially
outward. The force of the strut is not a chordal two-way

 A fully relaxed spherical tensegrity structure may
be crumpled together in a
tight bundle without hurting it, just as a net shopping
bag can be stuffed into a small space.
Thereafter, its drooped, untaut tension members can
only yield outward radially to the
dimensionally predesigned and prefabricated limits of
the omniclosed spheric system,
which must be progressively opened to accommodate the
progressive interconstruction of
the predesigned, prefabricated chordal lengths of the
only circumferentially arrayed
compression struts.

 The compression struts are islanded from one another,
that is, in each case,
neither of the separate compression strut's ends touches
any part of any other compression
strut in the spheric system. As struts are inserted
into the spheric-tension network, the
whole spheric system is seen to be expanding omnioutwardly,
as do pneumatic balloons
when air is progressively introduced into their previously

 Surprising behaviors are found in tensegrity structures.
The illustration
shows a house and a tree and a clothesline. The line
hangs low between the house and the
tree. To raise the line so that the clothes to be dried
will not sweep the ground, the line is
elevated by a pole that has one end thrust against the
ground and the other end pushed
outwardly against the line. The line tightens with the
pole's outer end at the vertex of an
angle stretched into the line. The line's angle shows
that the line is yielding in the direction
away from the thrusting pole.

 <B>Subvisible Discontinuity:</B> In the Babylonian, Egyptian,
and Ionian eras of
ways of looking at, thinking about, and formulating,
there evolved a concept of a "first
family" of geometrical "solids," in which each member
was characterized by all of its faces
being identical and all of its edges being one length
only. Humans were then unaware of
what physics was only much later to discover experimentally:
that nature discloses no
evidence of a continuum. Experiment discloses only aggregates
of separate, finitely closed
events. Ergo, there are no solids.

 Their optical illusion and stubbornly conditioned
reflexes have since
motivated one generation after another to go on teaching
and accepting the misconception
of geometric "solids," "planes," and "straight lines,"
where physics has discovered only
wavilinear trajectories of high-frequency, yes-no event
pulsations. With the misconception
of straight lines came the misconception of the many
lines going through the same point at
the same time. Wherefore the 12 edges that define the
cube were assumed to be absolute
straight lines, and therefore sets of them ran simultaneously
into the thus absolutely
determined eight corner "points" of the cube.

 Humans were accustomed to the idea that edges come
together at one
certain point. But we now know operationally that if
we look at any of the edges of any
item microscopically, there is no such absolute line,
and instead there is seen to be an
aggregate of atomic events whose appearance as an aggregate
is analogous to the roughly
rounding, wavilinear profiled, shoulder "edge" of a
rock cliff, sand, or earth bluff standing
high above the beach of the shore lying below, whose
bluff and beach disclose the gradual
erosion of the higher land by the sea.

 The corners of the solids are also just like the corners
of an ocean-side bluff
that happens to have its coastwise direction changed
at 90 degrees by large geological
events of nature such as an earthquake fault. Such an
easterly coastline's bluff casts dark
shadows as the Earth rotates; seen from airplanes at
great altitudes, long sections of that
black coastal shadow may appear illusionarily as "straight."

 We can make Platonic figures in nonsolid tensegrity
where none of the lines
go through any of the same points at the same time,
and we realize that the only seemingly
continuous, only mass-interattractively cohered, atomic
"Milky Way" tensor strands
spanning the gaps between the only seemingly "solid,"
omni-islanded, vectorially
compressioned struts, do altogether permit a systematic,
visually informed, and
realistically comprehended differentiation between the
flexible tensor and inflexible vector
energy-event behaviors, all of which are consistent
with all the experimental information
accruing to the most rigorous scientific discipline.

 The eye can resolve intervals of about 1/100th of
an inch or larger. Below
that, we do not see the aggregates as points. Thereafter,
we see only "solid"-color
surfaces. But our color receptivity, which means our
only-human-optics-tunable range of
electromagnetic radiation frequencies, cannot "bring
in," i.e., resonatingly respond to,
more than about one-millionth of the now known and only
instrumentally tune-in-able
overall electromagnetic-wave-frequency range of physical
Universe. This is to say that
humans can tune in directly to less than one-millionth
of physical reality<SUP>&#95;&#95;</SUP>ergo, cannot
"see" basic atomic and molecular-structuring events
and behaviors, but our synergetic
tensegrity principles of structuring are found instrumentally
to be operative to the known
limits of both micro- and macro-Universe system relationships
as the discontinuous,
entropic, radiational, and omnicohering, collecting
gravitational syntropics. (See Sec.

"lines" defining the edges of "solids," we see them

instead, twisting around each

 When we first try to differentiate tension and compression
in consciously
attempting to think about the behavior of structures
in various locals of Universe, it
becomes apparent that both macro-Universe and micro
Universe are only tensionally
cohered phenomena. They both obviously manifest discontinuous
compression islands. It
is evidenced, in cosmically structured systems, both
macro and micro, that compression
members never touch one another. Earth does not roll
"ball bearing" around on the surface
of Mars; nor does the Moon roll on Earth, and so forth.
This structural scheme of islanded
spheres of compression, which are only mass-attractively
cohered, also characterizes the
atomic nucleus's structural integrities. Tensegrity
discoveries introduce new and very
different kinds of structural principles which seem
to be those governing all structuring of
Universe, both macrocosmic and microcosmic.
