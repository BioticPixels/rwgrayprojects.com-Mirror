 <IMG SRC="../figs/blanksp.gif" BORDER=0> The norm of Einstein is
absolute speed instead of at rest. "At rest" was what we called
instantaneous in our innocence of yesterday. We evolute toward
ever lesser brain comprehension lags<SUP>&#95;&#95;</SUP>ergo,
toward ever diminishing error; ergo, ever diminishing
misunderstandings; ergo, ever diminishing fear, and
its brain-lagging painful errors of
objectivity; wherefore we approach eternal instantaneity
of absolute and total
comprehension.

 <IMG SRC="../figs/blanksp.gif" BORDER=0>
The eternal instantaneity of no lag at all. However,
we have now learned from our
generalizations of the great complexity of the interactions
of principles as we are
disembarrassed of our local, exclusively physical chemistry
of information-sensing
devices<SUP>&#95;&#95;</SUP>that what is approached is eternal and instant
awareness of absolute reality of
all that ever existed.

<BR>
 <IMG SRC="../figs/blanksp.gif" BORDER=0>
All the great metaphysical integrity of all the individuals,
which is potential and
inherent in the complex interactions of generalized
principles, will always and only
coexist eternally.
