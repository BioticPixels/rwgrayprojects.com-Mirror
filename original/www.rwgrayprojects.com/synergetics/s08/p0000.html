 Information is experience. Experience is information.
We have all
experienced the information given to us directly through
our own sensing faculties or
relayed to us by others through our sensing faculties,
but as originally sensed directly by
others and not by ourselves. The only way that we know
that we "are," that we are alive
in Universe, is through information apprehended by our
own sensorial faculties. We can
hear, see, taste, smell, and touch-feel. We have all
experienced the information-relaying
relationships between the old life and the new life.
The old life is excited to see how early
the new life develops, coordinates, and responds both
consciously to external information
and subconsciously to internally programmed instructions
of the brain or of the genes. The
old life tries to speed the development of the new life's
communicated comprehending by
pointing to first the child's and then the "old life"
speaker's eye and saying, "eye, eye,
eye," "mouth, mouth, mouth," and "ear, ear, ear," while
pointing to those instruments
until the child responds by making a similar sound.
However, it is seldom that we observe
parents thus engaged with their children refer to their
internal organs, such as the
endocrine glands. In fact, parents may not even know
of these glands, let alone where they
are situated. Such word-coaching by oldsters of youngsters
relies almost exclusively upon
identification of superficial characteristics and comprehends
only in superficial degree
those organs to which they refer.

 Let us imagine a scientifically conducted experiment
designed to disclose the
unique behavioral characteristics of each of those four
prime sensing faculties without
which we could not apprehend Universe and could not
have sense of being.

 Let us suppose that you are blindfolded and that your
mouth, nostrils, and
ears are also simultaneously bound closed. Only your
tactile sensing is operative. To find
out about yourself and local Universe, you would begin
by reaching out around you with
your arms-extended hands. You could learn environmental
conditions through your hands.
You could lean forward, and the sense of balance would
tell you how far you can reach
without shifting your base position. You discover that
you are prospecting with your
sensitive skin terminals, as does an insect with all
its radially and circumferentially
orientable feelers. Your most extreme and mobile skin
feelers are your toes and your
fingers. You are trying to get terminal reach information
before you move on from your
safe base. You will not risk shifting your weight until
you are certain that you will be
supported. You will not move into a place so small you
cannot turn around and escape.
Without changing your base, and standing with all your
weight on your left foot, you learn
that you can stretch out and sweep out with your arms
while at the same time sweeping
space and testing the ground's firmness with your right
leg. Thus you learn that there is a
maximum range of information gathering, which is the
distance between the right foot's
big toe and your left hand's middle fingertip. Most
of us have a toe-to-fingertip reach of
about six or eight feet. In these sense-limited conditions,
our only way of finding out about
Universe is tactile, through touch alone. Very quickly,
we become supersensitive with our
feet and hands, particularly with our feet and legs
in gravitational balancing. Every child
learns this in summer while at camp. At home, his parents
won't let him stay up after dark,
but maybe at night he is very fond of a path that goes
down to the water. He starts going
on that path and finds himself running along in the
dark. Even though you can't see, you
remember well the pattern of turns, depressions, hills,
and dales. Your feet feel familiar
with the path; the rhythm of steps and heartbeats subconsciously
monitors your memory-
bank control of your running along that familiar path
barefootedly in the dark. We find
experimentally that we can remember patterns tactilely
and feel very safe following them.
We are even able to run back and forth over a local
complex of familiar ground and we
can run at about 10 miles per hour. Wherefore our static
tactile information-gathering,
which commands a maximum spherical range of 10 feet
in diameter, is augmented by the
10-miles-per-hour dynamic range-minding capability.

 Ecology is the science of cataloguing, ordering, and
inspecting patterns of
life. Different kinds of life demonstrate different
patterns. There is a difference of radius of
sweepout of wolves, seagulls, and man. If we humans
had only the tactile sense to go by in
our ecological patterning, we could <B>only sweep</B> out a
fairly small territory, but we could
get so used to it that we would probably run around
in the known territory. (See Sec.

 But now suppose that you cover up all your skin and
uncover your nostrils
and your mouth. Your eyes and ears are still covered
and your feet and hands are now tied
down so you cannot move. You have only olfactory information.
Under these conditions,
men's measurements are governed by three factors: (1)
the radius of the permeation of
gases within gases; (2) the concentration and viscosity
of such gases, such as orange
groves, pine woods, and so forth; and (3) the wind.
Men coming in from months at sea
have smelled orange groves and pine trees at somewhere
around a mile offshore in still air.
Such gases remain sufficiently concentrated to be detectable
at a mile. (Of course, dogs
can smell at greater distances than our human standing-still
olfactory range of about a
mile.) If the wind is blowing, the velocity is enhanced
so we get smoke from forest fires at
great distances. In great, 400-miles-per-hour, high
altitude, jet stream winds, the smellable
concentration can persist to a range of even 100 miles.
Whereas our tactile sense's static
range is 10 feet, which equals about 1/500th of a mile;
and its dynamic velocity range
augmentation is 10 miles per hour, we find our olfactoral
static range of information-
gathering is 100 miles and its dynamic range is 400
miles per hour.

 If we now shut off the mouth and nostrils<SUP>&#95;&#95;</SUP>with eyes
and skin also blanked
out<SUP>&#95;&#95;</SUP>and we then open up only the ears, we cannot see,
smell, or feel; we have only
sounds to reckon by. Men have heard sounds at very great
distances. Sounds will bounce
on the water, into the atmosphere, and back on the water
again. Sound is a wave
phenomenon that men have heard at ranges up to 100 miles,
as in the case of the atomic
bomb. The speed of sound in the air is about 700 miles
per hour; the static hearing range is
about 100 miles, while the dynamic hearing range is
1,100 miles per hour (700 m.p.h. +
400 m.p.h. jet-stream wind = 1,100 m.p.h.).

 We next shut off the tactile, olfactory, and oral
sensing, then uncover and
open our eyes. Men see stars that are billions of miles
away. We know the velocity of light
is 186,000 miles per second, or about 700 million miles
per hour. We find that the visual
sensing is in an entirely different order of magnitude.
The tactile, olfactory, and oral
faculties as a group are so minuscule as compared to
the range of the visual that they
cannot even be considered together.

If we try to plot two curves of these static and dynamic
human sensing capabilities on a
chart, we will have no trouble in positioning the first
three senses; but to reach the point
on the chart at which the sight capabilities occur,
we will have to take an airplane and fly
for many days to reach those positions. It is clear
that as we recede from the first three
sets of points, they will tend gradually to appear as
one. This disparity has not been taught
to us. We were told that our senses were approximately
equal and alternate capabilities.
Court imposed "damage costs" for their respective losses
are approximately equal. We
found out the disparity ourselves by examining the limit-case
conditions, which can only
be discovered by physical experience. This method of
discovery is called "operational
procedure."

 One of the most surprising things about a newborn
child is that it is already
tactilely coordinated. Even in the first day, the baby
is so well coordinated tactilely that if
you put your finger against its palm, the baby will
close its hand firmly and deftly around
your finger, although it is not using its ears or eyes
at all. If you will now exert a tiny bit of
tension effort to remove your finger, the child will
respond at once by opening its hand.
The infant will repeat the closing and opening response
to your initiatives as many times as
you may wish to initiate. This should not surprise us
if we realize that the baby has been in
<I>tactile</I> communication with its mother for months before
evacuating her womb, within
which, however, its visual, olfactory, and aural faculties
were muted and inoperative. Not
much time after birth the child employs for the first
time its olfactory glands and starts
searching the mother's breast and the source of milk.
Quite a few days later it begins to
hear; and very much later, it sees. The sequence in
which the child's faculties become
employed corresponds to the order of increased range
of its respective faculties of
information apprehending.

 Thus we find the child successively coordinating the
first three faculties: the
tactile, the olfactory, and the aural. He begins to
learn how they work together and quite
rapidly gets to be very skillful in coordinating and
handling the information coming to him
through these senses. It is only days later that he
begins to use his sight. He tries tactilely,
olfactorily, and aurally to confirm what he sees to
be reality. He cannot do so over any
great distance because neither his arms and hands nor
his tasting mouth will reach very far.
Months later, the child crawls to check tactilely, olfactorily,
and aurally on phenomena still
further away; and thereby to coordinatingly sort out
his information inputs; and thereby
develop a scheme of<SUP>&#95;&#95;</SUP>and a total sense of<SUP>&#95;&#95;</SUP>reality and
repetitive event expectancy. He
crawls over to the chair to find that his eyes have
reported to him correctly that the chair is
indeed there. He begins to check up and coordinate on
more distant objects, and he finds
his visual ability to be reliable. The child seeing
the Fourth of July fireworks for the first
time sees a flash and then hears a boom. Maybe that
doesn't mean so much to him,
because boom (aural) and flash (optical) may be different
phenomena; but when he sees a
man hammering a fence post, he has by this time been
hammering a whole lot and he
knows the sound that makes. He may not be very sure
of the fireworks in the sky, the flash
and the boom, but he is really very confident about
the sound of the hammering of the
fence post. When he sees the man hammer and then hears
the sound a fraction later, he
begins to realize that there is some lag in the rates
in which he gets information from
different faculties. His eye gets it faster than his
ear.

 The three postnatal senses the child coordinates are
secondary. The first
prenatal one, the tactile, is primary. The real emphasis
of the judgment of life is on the
tactile, the primary, the thing you can touch.<SUP>2</SUP> The ranges
of the first three senses are so
close together, and sight is so different, that we may
best rank them as #1, <I>touch,</I> being a
primary set; with both #2, <I>olfactoral</I> coupled with #3,
<I>aural,</I> as a secondary set; and #4
<I>sight,</I> as a tertiary set: wherefore in effect, touch
is the <I>yesterday set;</I> while the olfactoral
and aural (what you are smelling, eating, saying, and
hearing) are the <I>now set;</I> while sight
(what only may be next) is the <I>future set.</I> (We can seem
to see, but we have not yet come
to it.) Whereas reality is <I>eternally now,</I> human apprehending
demonstrates a large
assortment of lags in rates of cognitions whose myriadly
multivaried frequencies of
myriadly multivaried, positive-negative, omnidirectional
aberrations, in multivaried
degrees, produce such elusively off-center effects as
possibly to result in an illusionary
awareness of an approximately unlimited number of individually
different awareness
patterns, all of whose relative imperfections induce
the illusion of a reality in which "life"
is terminal, because physically imperfect; as contrasted
to mind's discovery of an omni-
interaccommodative complex of a variety of different
a priori, cosmic, and eternal
principles, which can only be intellectually discovered,
have no weight, and apparently
manifest a perfect, abstract, eternal design, the metaphysical
utterly transcendent of the
physical.

 The 186,000-miles-per-second speed of light is so
fast that it was only just
recently measured, and it doesn't really have much meaning
to us. You don't have a sense
of 700 million miles per hour. If you did get to "see"
that way, you would be
spontaneously conscious of seeing the Sun eight minutes
after the horizon had obscured it;
ergo, consciously seeing an arc around the Earth's curvature.
We are not seeing that way
as yet. To explain our sight, we call it "instantaneous."
We say we can see instantaneously.
This fact has misled us very greatly. You insist that
you are seeing the black-and-white
page of this book, do you not? You're not. You have
a brain-centered television set, and
the light is bouncing off the page. The resultant comes
back through your optical system
and is scanned and actually goes back into the brain,
and you are seeing the page in your
brain. You are not seeing the page out in front of you.
We have gotten used to the idea
that we see outside of ourselves, but we just don't
do so. It only takes about a billionth of
a second for the light to bounce off the page and get
in the brain to be scanned, so the
child is fooled into thinking that he is seeing outside
of himself. And we are misinforming
ourselves in discounting the lag and assuming that we
see it "over there." No one has ever
seen outside themselves.

 Children looking at TV today look at it quite differently
from the way it was
to the first generation of TV adults. It begins to be
very much a part of the child's life, and
he tends to accredit it the way adults accredit what
they get from their eyes. When
children are looking at a baseball game, they are right
there in the field. All of our vision
operates as an omnidirectional TV set, and there is
no way to escape it. That is all we have
ever lived in. We have all been in omnidirectional TV
sets all our lives, and we have gotten
so accustomed to the reliability of the information
that we have, in effect, projected
ourselves into the field. We may insist that we see
each other out in the field. But all vision
actually operates inside the brain in organic, neuron-transistored
TV sets.

 We have all heard people describe other people, in
a derogatory way, as
being "full of imagination." The fact is that if you
are not full of imagination, you are not
very sane. All we do is deal in brain images. We traffic
in the memory sets, the TV sets,
the recall sets, and certain incoming sets. When you
say that you see me or you say "I see
you," or "I touch you," I am confining information about
you to the "tactile you." If I had
never had a tactile experience (which could easily be
if I were paralyzed at conception),
"you" might be only where I smell you. "You" would have
only the smellable identity that
we have for our dogs. You would be as big as you smell.
Then, if I had never smelled,
tasted, nor experienced tactile sensing, you would be
strictly the <I>hearable you.</I>

 What is really important, however, about you or me
is the <I>thinkable you</I> or
the <I>thinkable me,</I> the abstract metaphysical you or me,
what we have done with these
images, the relatedness we have found, what communications
we have made with one
another. We begin to realize that the dimensions of
the <I>thinkable you</I> are phenomenal,
when you hear Mozart on the radio, that is, the metaphysical<SUP>&#95;&#95;</SUP>only
intellectually
identifiable<SUP>&#95;&#95;</SUP>eternal Mozart who will always be there
to any who hears his music. When
we say "atom" or think "atom" we are intellect-to-intellect
with livingly thinkable
Democritus, who first conceived and named the invisible
phenomenon "atom." Were
exclusively tactile Democritus to be sitting next to
you, surely you would not recognize
him nor accredit him as you do the only-thinkable Democritus
and what he thought about
the atom. You say to me: "I see you sitting there."
And all you see is a little of my pink
face and hands and my shoes and clothing, and you can't
see <I>me,</I> which is entirely the
thinking, abstract, metaphysical me. It becomes shocking
to think that we recognize one
another only as the touchable, nonthinking biological
organism and its clothed ensemble.

 Reconsidered in these significant identification terms,
there is quite a
different significance in what we term "dead" as a strictly
tactile "thing," in contrast to the
exclusively "thinking" you or me. We can put the touchable
things in the ground, but we
can't put the thinking and thinkable you in the ground.
The fact that I see you only as the
touchable you keeps shocking me. The baby's spontaneous
touching becomes the

the inches or the feet. We talk

My exclusively tactile seeing
inadequacy becomes a kind of warning, despite my only
theoretical knowledge of the error
of seeing you only as the touchable you. I keep spontaneously
seeing the tactile living you.
The tactile is very unreliable; it has little meaning.
Though you know they are gentle,
sweet children, when they put on Hallowe'en monster
masks they "look" like monsters. It
was precisely in this manner that human beings came
to err in identifying life only with the
touchable physical, which is exactly what life isn't.

 We have all been brought up with a plane geometry
in which a triangle was
conceived and defined as an area <I>bound</I> by a closed line
of three edges and three angles. A
circle was an area <I>bound</I> by a closed line of unit radius.
The area outside the closed
boundary line was not only undefinable but was inconceivable
and unconsidered.

 In the abstract, ghostly geometry of the Greeks, the
triangle and circle were
inscribed in a plane that extended laterally to infinity.
So tiny is man and so limited was
man's experience that at the time of the Greeks, he
had no notion that he was living on a
planet. Man seemed obviously to be living on an intuitively
expansive planar world around
and above which passed the Sun and stars, after which
they plunged into the sea and arose
again in the morning. This cosmological concept of an
eternally extended, planar-based
Earth sandwiched between heaven above and hell below
made infinity obvious, ergo
axiomatic, to the Greeks.

 The Greek geometers could not therefore define the
planar extensibility that
lay outside and beyond the line of known content. Since
the surface outside of the line
went to infinity, you could not include it in your computation.
The Greeks' concept of the
geometrical, bound-area of their triangle<SUP>&#95;&#95;</SUP>or their circle<SUP>&#95;&#95;</SUP>lay
demonstrably on only one
bound-area side of the line. As a consequence of such
fundamental schooling, world
society became historically biased about everything.
Continually facing survival strategy
choices, society assumed that it must always choose
between two or more political or
religious "sides." Thus developed the seeming nobility
of loyalties. Society has been
educated to look for logic and reliability only on one
side of a line, hoping that the side
chosen, on one hand or the other of indeterminately
large lines, may be on the <I>inside</I> of
the line. This logic is at the head of our reflexively
conditioned biases. We are continually
being pressed to validate one side of the line or the
other.

 You can "draw a line" only on the surface of some
system. All systems
divide Universe into insideness and outsideness. Systems
are finite. Validity favors neither
one side of the line nor the other. Every time we draw
a line operationally upon a system,
it returns upon itself. The line always divides a whole
system's unit area surface into two
areas, each equally valid as unit areas. Operational
geometry invalidates all bias.

 The shortest distance between any two points on the
surface of a sphere is
always described by an arc of a great circle. A triangle
drawn most economically on the
Earth's surface or on the surface of any other sphere
is actually always a spherical triangle
described by great-circle arcs. The sum of the three
angles of a spherical triangle is never
180 degrees. Spherical trigonometry is different from
plane trigonometry; in the latter, the
sum of any triangle's angles is always 180 degrees.
There is no plane flat surface on Earth,
wherefore no plane triangles can be demonstrated on
its surface. Operationally speaking,
we always deal in systems, and all systems are characterized
projectionally by spherical
triangles, which control all our experimental transformations.

 Drawing or scribing is an operational term. It is
impossible to draw without
an object upon which to draw. The drawing may be by
depositing on or by carving
away<SUP>&#95;&#95;</SUP>that is, by creating a trajectory or tracery of
the operational event. All the objects
upon which drawing may be operationally accomplished
are structural systems having
insideness and outsideness. The drawn-upon object may
be either symmetrical or
asymmetrical. A piece of paper or a blackboard is a
system having insideness and
outsideness.

 When we draw a triangle on the surface of Earth (which
previously
unscribed area was unit before the scribing or drawing),
we divide Earth's surface into
two areas on either side of the line. One may be a little
local triangle whose three angles
seem to add up to 180 degrees, while the other big spherical
triangle complementing the
small one to account together for all the Earth's surface
has angles adding up to 900
degrees or less. This means that each corner of the
big triangle complementing the small
local one, with corners seeming to be only 60 degrees
each, must be 300 degrees each, for
there are approximately 360 degrees around each point
on the surface of a sphere.
Therefore the sum of all the three angles of the big
Earth triangles, which inherently
complement the little local 60-degree-per-corner equilateral
triangles, must be 900
degrees. The big 900-degree triangle is also an area
bounded by three lines and three
angles. Our schooled-in bias renders it typical of us
to miss the big triangle while being
preoccupied only locally with the negligibly sized triangular
area.

 If you inscribe one triangle on a spherical system,
you inevitably describe
four triangles. There is a concave small triangle and
a concave big triangle, as viewed from
inside, and a convex small triangle and a convex big
triangle, as viewed from outside.
Concave and convex are not the same, so at minimum there
always are inherently four
triangles.

 Background Nothingness: One spherical triangle ABC
drawn on the Earth's
surface inadvertently produces four triangles as the
corners of the surface triangle are
inherently related to the center of the Earth D, and
their lines of interrelatedness together
with the three edge lines of the surface triangle describe
a tetrahedron. (See Fig.
 <A HREF="p0000.html#812.03">812.03</A>.)
Drawing a triangle on the surface of the Earth (as described
at Sec.
 <A HREF="p0000.html#810.00">810</A>) also divides the
surface of the Earth into two areas<SUP>&#95;&#95;</SUP>one large, one small<SUP>&#95;&#95;</SUP>both
of which are bound by a
closed line with three edges and three angles. The large
triangle and the small triangle have
both concave and convex aspects<SUP>&#95;&#95;</SUP>ergo, four triangles
in all. Euler did not recognize the
background nothingness of the outside triangles. (See

 Under the most primitive pre-time-size conditions
the surface of a sphere
may be exactly subdivided into the four spherical triangles
of the spherical tetrahedron,
each of whose surface corners are 120-degree angles,
and whose "edges" have central
angles of 109 28'. The area of a surface of a sphere
is also exactly equal to the area of
four great circles of the sphere. Ergo, the area of
a sphere's great circle equals the area of
a spherical triangle of that sphere's spherical tetrahedron:
wherefore we have a circular
area exactly equaling a triangular area, and we have
avoided use of <I>pi</I> <IMG SRC="../figs/pi.gif">.

 If we draw a closed line such as a circle around Earth,
it must divide its total
unit surface into two areas, as does the equator divide
Earth into southern and northern
hemispheres. If we draw a lesser-sized circle on Earth,
such as the circle of North latitude
70&deg;, it divides Earth's total surface into a very large
southern area and a relatively small
northern area. If we go outdoors and draw a circle on
the ground, it will divide the whole

<I>very</I> small, the other <I>very</I> large.

 If our little circle has an area of one square foot,
the big circle has an area of
approximately five quadrillion square feet, because
our 8,000-mile-diameter Earth has an
approximately 200-million-square-mile surface. Each
square mile has approximately 25
million square feet, which, multiplied, gives a five
followed by fifteen zeros:
5,000,000,000,000,000 square feet. This is written by
the scientists as 5&#215;10<SUP>15</SUP> square feet;
while compact, this tends to disconnect from our senses.
Scientists have been forced to
disconnect from our senses due to the errors of our
senses, which we are now able to
rectify. As we reconnect our senses with the reality
of Universe, we begin to regain
competent thinking by humans, and thereby possibly their
continuance in Universe as

 If, instead of drawing a one-square-foot circle on
the ground<SUP>&#95;&#95;</SUP>which means
on the surface of the spherical Earth<SUP>&#95;&#95;</SUP>we were to draw
a square that is one foot on each
side, we would have the same size local area as before:
one square foot. A square as
defined by Euclid is an area bound by a closed line
of four equal-length edges and four
equal and identical angles. By this definition, our
little square, one foot to a side, that we
have drawn on the ground is a closed line of four equal
edges and equal angles. But this
divides all Earth's surface into two areas, both of
which are equally bound by four equal-
length edges and four equal angles. Therefore, we have
two squares: one little local one
and one enormous one. And the little one's corners are
approximately 90 degrees each,
which makes the big square's corners approximately 270
degrees each. While you may not
be familiar with such thinking, you are confronted with
the results of a physical
experiment, which inform you that you have been laboring
under many debilitating
illusions.

 If you make your small square a little bigger and
your bigger one a little
smaller by increasing the little one's edges to one
mile each, you will have a local one
square mile<SUP>&#95;&#95;</SUP>a customary unit of western United States
ranches<SUP>&#95;&#95;</SUP>and the big square will
be approximately 199,999,999 square miles. As you further
increase the size of the square,
using great-circle lines, which are the shortest distances
on a sphere between any two
points, to draw the square's edges, you will find the
small square's corner angles
increasing while the big one's corner angles are decreasing.
If you now make your square
so that its area is one half that of the Earth, 100
million square miles, in order to have all
your edges the same and all your angles the same, you
will find that each of the corners of
both squares is 180 degrees. That is to say, the edges
of both squares lie along Earth's
equator so that the areas of both are approximately
10 million square miles.

 The progressive enlargement of a triangle, a pentagon,
an octagon, or any
other equiedged, closed-line figure drawn on any system's
surface produces similar results
to that of the enlarging square with 180 degrees to
each corner at the equator. The closed-
line surface figure will always and only divide the
whole area into two complementary
areas. Each human making this discovery experimentally
says spontaneously, "But I didn't
mean to make the big triangle," or "the big square,"
or indeed, the big mess of pollution.
This lack of intention in no way alters these truths
of Universe. We are all equally
responsible. We are responsible not only for the big
complementary surface areas we
develop on systems by our every act, but also for the
finite, complementary outward
tetrahedron automatically complementing and enclosing
each system we devise. We are
inherently responsible for the complementary transformation
of Universe, inwardly,
outwardly, and all around every system we alter.
