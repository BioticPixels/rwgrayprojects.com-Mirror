 With one of the sharp points (A) of dividers (AB)
fixed at a point (X) on a
flat sheet of paper, sharp point B is rotated cuttingly
around until an equiradius circle of
paper is cut out. It is discovered experimentally that
if any point on the circular perimeter
is folded over to any other point on the circle's perimeter,
that the circle of paper always
folds in such a manner that one-half of its perimeter<SUP>&#95;&#95;</SUP>and
one-half of its area<SUP>&#95;&#95;</SUP>is always
congruent with the other half; and that the folded edge
always runs through the exact
center point X of the circle and constitutes a diameter
line of the circle. This demonstrates
that a diameter line always divides both the whole circular
area and the circle's perimeter-
circumference into two equal halves. If one diameter's
end comer W of the circle, folded
into halves, is folded over once more to congruence
with the corner W' at the other end of
the diameter, once again it will be constructively proved
that all of the circle's perimeter is
congruent with itself in four folded-together layers,
which operational constructing also
divides the whole circle into four equal parts, with
the second folded diameter Y-Y'
perpendicular to the first diameter, ergo producing
four right-angled comers at the center
of the circle as marked by the two diameter fold lines,
W-W' and Y-Y'. If we now open the
paper circle and turn it over to its reverse side, we
fold in a third diameter line T-T' by
making circumference point W congruent with circumference
point Y (which inadvertently
makes point W' congruent with Y'), we will find that
we have exactly halved the right
angles WXY and W'XY', so that the perimeter distances
WT or TY are each exactly half the
perimeter distance WY, and either W'T' or T'Y' are each
one-half the perimeter distances
of either WY, YW', W'Y', or Y'W.

 If we now turn the paper circle over once more we
find that the spring in the
fold lines of the paper will make point T and T' approach
each other so that the whole
circle once again may be folded flat to produce four
congruent surfaces of the paper
folded into an overall composite quarter circle with
the two quarter-circle outer layers,
and four one-eighth circle's two inner layers coming
to congruent fold-around terminal
tangency at the midpoint and center of the folded, right-angle,
quarter-circle packet, with
W congruent with Y and W' congruent with Y' and T congruent
with T'. Thus it is proven
that with three diameter foldlines the whole circle
can be subdividingly folded into six arc-
and-central-angle increments, ergo also unfoldable again
into whole-circle flatness. (See
Illus. 835.02.)

 We know that every point on the perimeter of the folded
semicircle is
equidistant from the point of origin. We may now go
to one end of the folded-edge
diameter and fold the paper in such a manner that two
ends of the diameter are congruent.
This will fold the paper circle into four quadrants
which, by construction congruence, are
exactly equal. The legs of the 90 degree angle formed
around the origin of the circle by
this second folding are the same in length, being the
same radius as that of the circle, ergo,
of the halved diameter produced by the second folding.
The angle edges and the radii are
identical. When we open the quarter-circle of four faces
folded together into the
semicircle, we find that the second fold edge, which
produced the 90-degree angle, is the
radius of the diameter perpendicular to the first diameter
folded upon. The points where
this perpendicular diameter's ends intersect the circumference
of the circle are equidistant,
by construction, from the diameter ends of the first
folded-edge diameter of the semicircle.
This folded semicircle, with its secondary fold-mark
of verticality to its origin, can be
partially folded again on that perpendicular radius
so that the partially folded semicircle
and its partially folded, vertically impinging fold-line
constitute an angularly winged unit,
with appearance similar to the outer hard covers of
a partially opened book standing
bottomless with the book's hard covers vertically perpendicular
to a table. This flying-
winged, vertically hinged pair of double-thickness quarter-circles
will be found to be
vertically stable when stood upon a table, that is,
allowed to be pulled vertically against
the table by gravity. In structural effect, this winged
quarter-pair of open, standing "book
covers" is a tripod because the two diameter ends, A
and B, and the circle's origin point,
C, at the middle represent three points, A, B, C, in
triangular array touching the table,
which act as a triangle base for the tripod whose apex
is at the perimeter, T, of the
semicircle at the top terminal of the vertical fold.
The tripod's legs are uneven, one being
the vertical radius of the original circle, TC, and
the other two being the equidistance
chords, a and b, running from the top of the vertical
"book" column's back and leading
directly to the two wing terminals, A and B, of the
first folded diameter of the original
circle. The weight of the paper on either side of the
vertical fold extended on only one side
of any line produces weight or gravitational effect
to keep the vertical edge vertical, not
allowing it to lean farther in the direction of the
legs due to the relative structural rigidity
of the paper itself.

 We will now take five additional pieces of paper,
making six in all, producing
the circles on each of the same radius with our dividers
welded and using the scissor
function of the dividers' cuttingly ground straightedges.
We cut the circles out and fold
them in the manner already described to produce the
vertically standing, angular
interaction of the four quadrants of paper, standing
as a vertically edged tripod with
double thicknesses of the paper in arced flanges acting
as legs to stabilize their verticality.
We now have six such assemblies. We can take any two
of them that are standing
vertically and bring the vertical edges of their tripods
together. (We know that they are the
same size and that the vertical hinges are dimensionally
congruent because they are all of
the same radius length produced by the dividers.) We
move two of their vertically folded
edges into tangential congruence, i.e., back-to-back.
The vertical perimeter terminals of
their vertically folded hinges and their circle-center
origins at the bottom of the hinges are
congruent.

 To hold their vertical hinges together and to free
our hands for other work,
we slip a bobby pin over their four thicknesses of paper,
holding their two angles together
in the pattern of a cross as viewed vertically from
above or below. This construction
produces a <I>quadripod.</I> Now I can grasp this cross between
two of my fingers inserted into
the angles of the cross and lift it from the table,
turning it upside down in my hands and
finding the other side of the cross, all four lines
of which are in the same (approximately
flat) plane, in contradistinction to the way the cross
looked when those four folded edges
sat on the table and had four arcing lines running in
four different directions from their
vertical congruence. I will insert a bobby pin to hold
together the cross at its folded-line
intersection. With its flat cross down, it will now
stand as the partial profiling of a
hemisphere. When I put the arced cross down on the table,
it will roll around as would
half a wooden ball. Placing it on the table in this
roll-around hemisphere attitude, I can
stabilize it with underprops so that the plane of four
folded edges coming together on top
will be approximately horizontal and parallel to the
table top.

 I may now take one of the four additional quadri-folded,
partially opened,
hinged, quarter-circle, double-thickness assemblies
first described as able to stand
vertically by themselves. Each of the four can be made
to stand independently with one of
its 90-degree, quarter-circle wings lying horizontally
on the table and its other quarter-fold
wing standing approximately vertically. The four quarter-circles
on the table can be slid
together to form a whole circle base; bobby pins can
be inserted at their four
circumference terminals to lock them together in a circle;
and their four approximately
vertical flanges can be hinged into true verticality
so that they form two half-circle arcs,
passing through one another perpendicularly to one another.
They will have a common
vertical radius (by construction) at the common top
terminal, and all of their four vertical
hinges' two crossing bobby pins can be inserted to lock
this vertex together. This assembly
of four of the six units with circular base can now
be superimposed upon the first pair of
hinges sitting on the table with hemisphere down and
its planar cross up. The four cross
ends of that first assembly can be hinged around into
congruence with the 90-degree
circumference points of the top assembled four units,
with everything firmly congruent by
construction.

 Fastened by bobby pins at the congruent perimeter
terminals of the folded
cross lines, this top assembly stabilizes the previously
unstable angular space between any
two of the cross-forming hemispherical groups prop-stabilized,
bowl down, with the plane
of its four-way hinge cross horizontal and parallel
to the table. The angle between any two
of the horizontally crossed assembly members is now
stabilized at exactly one-quarter of a
circle by the integrity of construction procedures of
our experiment. This produces one
complete horizontal circle with 90-degree triangular
webbing of double-folded paper
perpendicular to two other perpendicularly intersecting
vertical circles, each of which also
consist of four 90-degree triangular webs of double-thickness
paper, each of all 12 of
which 90-degree triangular webs structurally stabilizes
the six radial hinges of the three
XYZ axes of this spherically profiled system assembly,
prop-stabilized not to roll on the
table.

 In effect, we have the original six circular pieces
reassembled with one
another as two sets of three circles symmetrically intercepting
one another. We know that
each of the six quadrantly folded units fit into the
remaining angular spaces because, by
construction, each of the angles was folded into exactly
one-quarter of a circle and folded
together exactly to complete their circle. And we know
that all the radial hinges fit
together because they are constructionally of equal
length. We have now a triangularly
stabilized structure constituting what is called the
spherical octahedron. Its vertical axis
has polar terminals we call north and south. South is
congruent with the table, and north is
at the apex of the assembly. It has four equatorial
points lying in a plane horizontal to the
table. It is called the spherical octahedron because
it has an external pattern subdivided
exactly, evenly, and symmetrically by eight spherical
triangles, four in the northern
hemisphere and four in the southern hemisphere.

 We find that the construction has three distinct planes
that are all
symmetrical and perpendicular to one another; the horizontal
equatorial plane and two
vertical planes intersect each other on the north-south
polar axis perpendicularly to one
another, which perpendicularity is constructurally inherent.
Each of the perpendicularly
intersecting great circles is seen to be of a double
thickness due to the folding of the six
original paper great circles, which now appear, deceptively,
as three, but are not
continuous planes, being folded to make their hinges
congruent. (See Illus.

 As we rotate this octahedron rapidly on any one of

 In addition to the foregoing operational development
of the octahedron, we
discover that the assembling of the spherical octahedron
called for a fundamental
asymmetry of procedure. That is, we assemble two of
its quadrantly folded great circles to
form one hemisphere and four of the quadrantly folded
great circles to form the other
hemisphere. In this method, the equator has to be included
in either the northern or the
southern hemisphere.

 Therefore, in attempting to find some other method
of assembly, we find that
the spherical octahedron can be alternatively assembled
in three sets of two quadrantly
folded great circles. This is done by following all
of the general procedures for developing
the six quadrantly folded circles and their stand-up-ability
as open book backs, producing
a tripoding stability with the angle hinged by the variability
of the vertical book-back
spine.

 We will now make three pairs of these variantly angled,
quadrantly folded
circles. We find that instead of standing one of them
as a book with its hinge-spine
vertical, the book can be laid with one of its faces
parallel to the table and the other
pointing approximately vertically, outward from the
table. Due to the relative inflexibility
of the double-folded angle of the greatcircle construction
paper, the book can be laid on
its front face or its back face. We will take two of
them sitting on the front face of the
book with their backs reaching outwardly, vertically
away from the table. We move two in
front of us, one right and one left. We will rotate
the right-hand one counterclockwise, 90
degrees around its vertical axis. Then we move the quadrant
angle of the right-hand one
into congruence with the quadrant angle of the left-hand
one. We stabilize the variable
angle of the right-hand one between its vertical and
horizontal parts by fastening with two
bobby pins the constructionally produced stable quadrant
of the folded parts of the right-
hand unit. This gives us a constructionally proven one-eighth
of a sphere in an
asymmetrical assembly, having the 1 80-degree axis of
the sphere lying congruent with the
table. On one end of the axis, we have the stabilized
quadrant angle; on the other end of
the axis, we have the open, unstabilized angle.

 With the other four of our six quadrantly folded circles,
we make two more
paired assemblies in exactly the same manner as that
prescribed for the first paired
assembly. We now have three of these assemblies with
their axes lying on the table; on the
left-hand side of all three, there will be found the
stabilized, spherical-octant triangle. On
the left side, there is a folded quadrant, where the
angle between the vertical axis of the
spherical octant is approximately 90 degrees from the
folded axis lying on the table<SUP>&#95;&#95;</SUP>but
an unstabilized 90 degrees; it can be stabilized into
90-degreeness by virtue of the fact that
both of its open folded edges are radii of the sphere
by construction and have an
accommodating, open hinge-line. We notice then that
the three axes lying on the table, as
the interior edge of the semicircle of double-ply folded
paper, represent the three XYZ axes
of the octahedron as well as the XYZ 90-degree coordinates
of the international scientific
standards of comprehensive mensuration<SUP>&#95;&#95;</SUP>as, for instance,
the X axis represents the
height, Y the width, and Z the breadth. Geographically,
this would represent the north and
south poles and the four perpendicular quadrants of
the equator.

 Our operational-construction method employs the constant
radius and
identifies every point on the circumference and every
point on the internal radii. This is in
contradistinction to analytic geometry, in which the
identification is only in terms of the
XYZ coordinates and the perpendiculars to them. Analytic
geometry disregards
circumferential construction, ergo, is unable to provide
for direct identification of angular
accelerations.

 These three subassemblies of the six folded quadrants
are inherently
asymmetrical. It was the fundamental asymmetry that
made it possible to make the
spherical octahedron with only three whole circles of
paper, but we found it could only be
accomplished symmetrically with six quadrantly folded
great circles, with the symmetry
being provided by the duality, by the twoness.

 All three assemblies are identically asymmetric. The
loaded XYZ axes hold
the Y axis vertically. Pick up the Y axis and turn it
90 degrees to the X axis. This brings
one of the stabilized quadrants of the Y axis into congruence
with one of the nonstabilized
quadrants of the X axis<SUP>&#95;&#95;</SUP>to stabilize it. With the Y
axis now at 90 degrees to the X axis,
we can fasten the two assemblies into place with bobby
