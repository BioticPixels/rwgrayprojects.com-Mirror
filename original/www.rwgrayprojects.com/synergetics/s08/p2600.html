 Had the Greeks originally employed a universal model
of x-dimensional
reality as their first tool upon and within which they
could further inscribe and measure
with their divider, scriber, and straightedge, they
would have been able to arrive at unity of
circumferential as well as radial modularity. This would
have been very convenient to
modern physics because all the accelerations of all
the constantly transforming physical
events of Universe are distinguished by two fundamentally
different forms of acceleration,
angular and linear.

 <B>Hammer Throw:</B> When a man accelerates a weight on the
end of a cord by
swinging it around his head, the weight is restrained
by the cord and it accumulates the
energy of his exertions in the velocity it maintains
in a circular pattern. This is angular
acceleration, and its velocity rates and angular momentum
are calculated in central-angle
increments of the circular movement accomplished within
given units of time. When the
weight's cord is released by its human accelerator,
it then goes into linear acceleration and
its accomplished distance is measured in time increments
following its release and its
known release velocity, which calculations are modified
by any secondary restraints.

 The angular accelerations relate then to the myriad
of circular or elliptical
orbitings of components of systems around their respective
centers or focii, and are
intimate to original acceleration-generating factors
such as the "hammer thrower" himself
and his muscle as the metabolic powering by the beef
he ate the day before, which gained
its energy from vegetation it had eaten, which gained
its energy from the Sun's radiation
by photosynthesis- all of whose attendant relative efficiencies
of energy relaying were
consequent upon the relative design efficacies and energy
divergence to complementary
environment conditions of the total synergetically effective
system with the eventually total
regenerative Universe itself.<SUP>3</SUP>
<BR>
<BR>
(Footnote 3: This is a typical illustration of total energy
accounting, which all society must become conversant with
in short order if we are to pass through the crisis and flourish
upon our planet.  If we do suceed, it will be because, among other
planetary events, humans will have come to recognize that the common
wealth equating accounting must be one that locks fundamental
and central energy incrementations--such as kilowatts hours--to human
physical-energy work capability and its augmentation by the
mind-comprehending employability of generalized principles
of Universe, as these may be realistically appraised
in the terms of increasing numbers of days for increasing hours
and distances of increasing freedoms for increasing numbers
of human beings.  All of this fundamental data can be introduced
into world computer memories, which can approximately instantly
enlighten world humanity on its increasingly more effective
options of evolutionary cooperation and fundamentally
spontaneous social commitment.)

 <B>Science as a Tool:</B> The linear measurements represent
the radial going-away
accelerations or resultants of earlier or more remote
events as well as of secondary
restraints. The rigid rectilinear angularity of the
90-degree-central-angle XYZ mensuration
instituted by the Greeks made impossible any unit language
of direct circumferential or
peripheral coordination between angular and linear phenomena.
As a consequence, only
the radial and linear measurements have been available
to physics. For this reason, physics
has been unable to make simultaneous identification
of both wave and particle aspects of
energy events.

 The Greeks' planar inception of geometry and its diversion
first into
theoretical mathematical calculations and ultimate abandonment
of models has occasioned
the void of ignorance now existing between the sciences
and the humanities imposed by
the lack of logical and unitarily moduled conceptual
systems. This, in turn, has occasioned
complete social blindness to either the facts or the
potential benefits of science to
humanity. Thus science has now come to represent an
invisible monster to vast numbers of
society, wherefore society threatens to jettison science
and its "obnoxious" technology,
not realizing that this would lead swiftly to genocide.
Central to this crisis of terrestrially
situate humans is the necessity for discovering and
employing a comprehensively
comprehendible universal coordinate system that will
make it swiftly lucid to world society
that science and technology are only manipulative tools
like inanimate and cut-offable
hands which may be turned to structuring or destructuring.
How they are to be employed
is not a function of the tools but of human choice.
The crisis is one of the loving and
longing impulse to understand and be understood, which
results as informed
comprehension. It is the will to structure versus ignorant
yielding to fear-impulsed
reflexive conditioning that results from being born
utterly helpless. Intellectual
information-accumulating processing and anticipatory
faculties are necessary, and are only
slowly discovered as exclusively able to overcome the
ignorantly feared frustrating
experiences of the past. Science must be seen as a tool
of fundamental advantage for all,
which Universe requires that man understand and use
exclusively for the positive
advantage of all of humanity, or humanity itself will
be discarded by Universe as a viable
evolutionary agent.

 It is to this dilemma that we address ourselves; not
being interested in
palliatives, we backtrack two and a half millennia to
the turning of the road where we
entered in the hope of regaining the highway of lucid
rationality. Using the same Greek
tools, but not starting off with a plane or the subsequently
substituted blackboard of the
pedagogues working indoors and deprived of direct access
to the scratchable Earth

 Release from angular acceleration appears to be linear
acceleration, but the
linearity is only theoretical. Linear acceleration is
the release from the restraint of the
nearest accelerator to the angularly accelerative or
decelerative restraint of the integrated
vectorial resultant of all the neighboringly dominant,
forever-otherness restraints in
Universe. Linear acceleration never occurs, because
there is no cosmic exemption of
otherness.

 The hammer thrower releases his "hammer's" ball-and-rod
assembly from his
extended arm's-end grasp, seemingly allowing the hammer
to take a tangentially linear
trajectory, but Earth's gravitational pull immediately
takes over and converts the
quasistraight trajectory into an elliptical arc of greater
orbiting radius than before. But the
arc is one of ever-decreasing radius as the Earth's
gravity takes over and the hammer
thrower's steel ball seemingly comes to rest on the
Earth's surface, which is, however, in
reality traveling around the Earth's axis in synchronized
consonance with the other
huddled together atoms of the Earth's surface. Near
the Earth's equator this would be at a
circular velocity of approximately 1000 miles an hour,
but near the Earth's poles the
velocity would be only inches per hour around the Earth's
axis. Both Earth, hammer
thrower, and thrown hammer are traveling at 60,000 miles
an hour around the Sun at a
radial restraint distance of approximately 92 million
miles, with the galaxies of Universe's
other nonsimultaneously generated restraints of all
the othernesses' overlappingly effective
dominance variations, as produced by degrees of neighboring
energy concentrations and
dispersions. It is the pulsation of such concentrations
and dispersions that brings about the
elliptical orbiting.

 Isaac Newton's first law of motion, "A body persists
in a state of rest or in a
straight line except as affected by other forces," should
now be restated to say, "Any one
considered body persists in any one elliptical orbit
until that orbit is altered to another
elliptical orbit by the ceaselessly varying interpositionings
and integrated restraint effects
imposed upon the considered body by the ever-transforming
generalized cosmic
otherness." A body is always responding orbitally to
a varying plurality of otherness
forces.

 Our steel dividers have sharp, straightedged legs,
each tapering into sharp
points. We can call these dividers "scissors." Scissors
are dividers of either linear or
angular, i.e. circular, differentiation. We can even
make our explorations with some
superficial accommodation of the Greeks' propensity
for using a plane. For instance, we
can take a finite piece of paper, remembering (operationally),
however, that it has
"thickness" and "edges," which are in fact small area
faces. If it is a rectilinear sheet of
typewriter paper, we recognize that it has four minor
faces and two major faces. The
major faces we call "this side" and "the other side,"
but we must go operationally further
in our consideration of what the "piece of paper" is.
Looking at its edges with a
magnifying glass, we find that those surfaces round
over rather brokenly, like the
shoulders of a hillside leading to a plateau. We find
the piece of paper to be fundamentally
the same kind of entity as that which we have watched
the baker make as he concocts,
stirs, and thickens his piecrust dough, which, after
powdering with flour, can be formed
into a spherical mass and set upon a flour-powdered
surface to be progressively rolled into
a thick sheet that may be cut into separate increments
of the same approximate dimensions
as the "sheet" of typewriter paper.

 In the same operational piecrust-making strictness
of observation, we realize
that the phase of topology that Moebius employed in
developing his famous strip
mistakenly assumed that the strip of paper had two completely
nonconnected faces of such
thinness as to have no edge dimension whatsoever. When
we study the Moebius strip of
paper and the method of twisting one of its ends before
fastening them together and
scribing and cutting the central line of the strip only
to find that it is still a single circle of
twice the circumference and half the width of the strip,
we realize that the strip was just a
partially flattened section of our piecrust, which the
baker would have produced by
making a long hard roll, thinner than a breadstick and
flattened out with his wooden roller.
What Moebius really did was to take a flattened tube,
twist one of its ends 180 degrees,
and rejoin the tube ends to one another. The scribed
line of cutting would simply be a
spiral around the tube, which made it clear that the
two alternate ends of the spirals were
joined to one another before the knifing commenced.

 We can use the leverage of the sheet length of flatness
of the paper against
the fulcrum of the sheet of paper's thinness to fold
it as a relatively flat system, even as the
baker could fold over the unbaked piecrust. Or we can
scribe upon the paper with our
geometrical tools in an approximately accurate measuring
manner. What we have done is
to flatten our system in a measurefully knowing manner.
For operational accommodation,
but always by construction, we can for the moment consider
the paper's surface as did the
Greeks their infinitely extending plane, but we are
aware and will always be responsible for
"the rest of the system" with which we are working,
though we are momentarily
preoccupied with only a very local area of the whole.

the approximately straight
diameter through the circle's center. We can now use

finite circle of paper from the finite balance of the
paper system lying outside the
circle<SUP>&#95;&#95;</SUP>that is, we can scissor or "cut" out the area
contained by the circle from the

 Because we are dealing with multidimensional reality,
we must note
operationally that in cutting out our circular piece
of paper, we are also cutting our
original piece of typewriter paper into two pieces,
the other piece of which has a circular
hole in its overall rectilinear area. We must keep ourselves
conscious of this
complementary consequence even though we are for the
moment interested only in the
cut-out circular piece pricked with the original center
of the divider-generated
circumference. (The Maori, whose prime love was the
Pacific Ocean, looked upon islands
as holes in their ocean and upon what man calls harbors
or bays as protrusions of the
ocean inserted into the land.) Now, from our cut-out
circle and our inventory of
construction produced information, we learn experimentally
that we can lift any point of
the perimeter of the circle and fold it over so that
the point of the perimeter is congruent
with any other point on the perimeter; in doing so,
we find that we are always folding the
circular system of paper into two semicircles whose
hinge lines always run through the
points of origin.

 By construction, we can demonstrate that the circle
of paper may be folded
along its constructionally scribed diameter, and because
all of its perimeter points are
equidistant from the center of the circle, the semicircular
edges are everywhere congruent.
We find that we can fold the circle along any of its
infinite number of diameters and the
two half-circle circumferences (or perimeters = run
arounds = racetracks) will always be
congruent as folded together. The same infinity of diameters
could be used to fold the
paper-circle diameters in the opposite direction on
the underside of the original plane.

 Having deliberately colored our original paper's two
opposite major sides
with two different colors, red and white, we will see
that our set of paper-circle folding
along its infinity of diameters resulted in red half-circles,
while the folding in the opposite
direction produced all white half-circles. We also discover
that as we fold from flat whole
circle to congruence with the other half-circle, among
any of the infinity of diameters
along which to fold, the circumference of any one side
of the circle moves toward the
circumference on the other half, and as it travels 180
degrees around its diameter hinges,
its perimeter thus describes a hemisphere of points
all equidistant from the same center of
all the hinges.

 Having worked from a unitary plane and employing the
infinity of diameters
to fold in opposite directions, we discover that all
the combined red and white opposite
semicircular foldings altogether have produced a sphere
consisting of two complementary
hemispheres, one red and one white, which altogether
represent all the rotatings of the
equidistant circumferences, always from the same common
center of all the diameters,

by our straightedge along which we
scribed through the original center mark of our generation
of the circle.
