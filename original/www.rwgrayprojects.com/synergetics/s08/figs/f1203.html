<TR><TD>Fig. 812.03: The Greeks defined a triangle as an area
bound by a closed line of three edges and three
angles. A triangle drawn on the Earth's surface is actually
a spherical triangle described by three great-
circle arcs. It is evident that the arcs divide the
surface of the sphere into two areas, each of which
is
bound by a closed line consisting of three edges and
three angles, ergo dividing the total area of the
sphere into two complementary triangles. The area apparently
"outside" one triangle is seen to be
"inside" the other. Because every spherical surface
has two aspects_convex if viewed from outside,
concave if viewed from within_each of these triangles
is, in itself, two triangles. Thus one triangle
becomes four when the total complex is understood. "Drawing"
or "scribing" is an operational term. It is
impossible to draw without an object upon which to draw.
The drawing may be by depositing on or by
carving away, that is, by creating a trajectory or tracery
of the operational event. All the objects upon
which drawing may be operationally accomplished are
structural systems having insideness and
outsideness. The drawn-upon object may be symmetrical
or asymmetrical, a piece of paper or a
blackboard system having insideness and outsideness.
