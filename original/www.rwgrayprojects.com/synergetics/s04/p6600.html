 An earlier version of Fig. 466.01 was first published
by the author in 1944: it
illustrates the energy-valving aspects of the closest-packed
spheres interfunctionings as
they occur within the three-frequency, 92-ball outer
layer of the vector equilibrium as it
"jitterbuggingly" skew-transforms into the icosahedral
state, then returns to the vector
equilibrium state, passes through, and again transforms
to the alternately skewed
icosahedral state<SUP>&#95;&#95;</SUP> repeat and repeat.

 The 90-degree interalignment of the 16 balls of any
one of the six square
faces of the vector equilibrium (Fig. B) is inherently
unstable. The 16 balls resolve their
instability by forming any one of two alternate types
of most closely packed diamonds
(Figs. D and E) with either a short cross axis or a
long diagonal axis. Both types are
equiedged, equiarea, and most densely packed, and they
occupy less area than their
equiedged square counterparts. This is quickly evidenced
geometrically because both the
square (Fig. B) and the diamond (Fig. D) have the same-length
base edge XY, but the
altitude WZ of the square is greater than the altitude
Z of the diamond.

 As displayed in a planar array, Fig. A, there is an
apex sphere K
surroundingly shared by the innermost corners (vertexes)
of two square-faced, 16-ball
grids, M and N, as well as by the two diamondsÑthe short-axis

 The apex sphere K's neighboring spheres are uncomfortable
because K is
surrounded by seven spheres and not six. Only six can
closest pack around one in any
given plane. One of the two adjacent spheres M or N
from the two square-faced grids will
get pushed in, and the other one will be pushed out,
depending upon which way the
vector-equilibrium-to-icosahedron jitterbug transformation
is rotating around apex sphere
K. The "in-and-out" pumping of spheres M and N acts
as an energy-propagating valve.

 Where we have six balls in a planar array closest
packed around one nucleus,
we produce six top and six bottom concave tetrahedral
valleys surrounding the nucleus
ball. We will call the top set of valleys the northern
set and the bottom set the southern
set. Despite there being six northern valleys we find
that we can nest only three close-
packed (triangulated) balls in the valleys. This is
because we find that the balls nesting on
top of the valleys occupy twice as much planar area
as that afforded by the six tetrahedral
valleys. Three balls can rest together on the top in
omni-close-packed tangency with one
another and with the seven balls below them; and three
balls can similarly rest
omniintertangentially in the bottom valleys as their
top and bottom points of tangency
bridge exactly across the unoccupied valleys, allowing
room for no other spheres. This
produces the symmetrical nuclear vector equilibrium
of 12 closest-packed spheres around
one. (See Fig. <A HREF="p6600.html#466.13">466.13A</A>.)

 The three balls on the top can be lifted as a triangular
group and rotated 60
degrees in a plane parallel to the seven balls of the
hexagonal equatorial set below them;
this triangular group can be then set into the three
previously vacant and bridged-over
valleys. As this occurs, we have the same 12 spheres
closest packed around one with an
overall arrangement with the two triangular sets of
three on the top, three on the bottom,
and six around the equator. The top and the bottom triangular
sets act as poles of the
system, which<SUP>&#95;&#95;</SUP> as with all systems<SUP>&#95;&#95;</SUP> has inherent free
spinnability. In both of the two
alternate valley occupations the northern polar triangle
is surrounded alternately by three
squares and three triangles, reading alternately<SUP>&#95;&#95;</SUP> triangle,
square, triangle, square,

 In one polar triangular valley occupation the squares
of the northern
hemisphere will be adjacent to the triangles of the
southern hemisphere. This is the vector-
equilibrium condition. In the alternate valley nesting
position at the equator the equatorial
edges of the squares of the northern hemisphere will
abut the squares of the southern
hemisphere, and the triangles of the northern hemisphere
will abut those of the southern,
producing a polarized symmetry condition. In the vector-equilibrium
condition we have
always and everywhere the triangle-and-square abutments,
which produces a four-
dimensional symmetry system.

 There is then a duality of conditions of the same
12 nucleus-surrounding first
omni-inter-closest-packed layer: we have both a polarized
symmetry phase and an
equilibrious symmetry phase. Under these alternate conditions
we have one of those
opportunities of physical Universe to develop a pulsative
alternation of interpatterning
realizations, whereby the alternations in its equilibrium
phase do not activate energy, while
its polarized phase does activate energetic proclivities.
The equilibrious phase has no
associative proclivities, while the polarized phase
has associative proclivities. In the
polarized phase we have repulsion at one end and attraction
at the other: potential
switchings on and off of energetic physical Universe.

 When modular frequency enters into the alternately

the multifrequenced nuclear system
are occupied by uniradius spheres, whereat it is evidenced
that the equatorial continuity
set of spheres can be claimed either by the northern

squares, but they cannot serve both simultaneously.
Here again we have alternating

equilibrium condition having a large

 People think of centrifugal force as picturable by
arrows expelled radially
(perpendicularly) outward. But in fact centrifugal force
operates as a hammer-thrower's
hammer does: it departs from the system tangentially,
not radially. Since the outward
tangent ends reach ever farther away, there is a net
only-indirectly-radial force realized.
This common misapprehension of the assumed 180-degreeness
of centrifugal forces has
greatly misled human thinking and has obscured comprehensions
of precession.
