 The system of 25 great circles of the vector equilibrium
defines its own
lowest common multiple spherical triangle, whose surface
is exactly 1/48th of the entire
sphere's surface. Within each of these l/4sth-sphere
triangles and their boundary arcs are
contained and repeated each time all of the unique interpatterning
relationships of the 25
great circles. Twenty-four of the 48 triangles' patternings
are "positive" and 24 are
"negative," i.e., mirrorimages of one another, which
condition is more accurately defined
as "inside out" of one another. This inside-outing of
the big triangles and each of their
contained triangles is experimentally demonstrable by
opening any triangle at any one of
its vertexes and holding one of its edges while sweeping
the other two in a 360-degree
circling around the fixed edge to rejoin the triangle
with its previous outsideness now
inside of it. This is the basic equilibrium LCD triangle;
for a discussion of the basic
disequilibrium LCD triangle, see

 The 25 great circles of the spherical vector equilibrium
provide all the
spherical edges for five spherical polyhedra: the tetrahedron,
octahedron, cube, rhombic
dodecahedron, and vector equilibrium, whose corresponding
planar-faceted polyhedra are
all volumetrically rational, even multiples of the tetrahedron.
For instance, if the
tetrahedron's volume is taken as unity, the octahedron's
volume is four, the cube's volume
is three, the rhombic dodecahedron's is six, and the
vector cquilibrium's is 20 (see
drawings section).

 This is the hierarchy of rational energy quanta values
in synergetics, which
the author discovered in his youth when he first sought
for an omnirational coordinate
system of Universe in equilibrium against which to measure
the relative degrees of orderly
asymmetries consequent to the cosmic myriad of pulsatively
propagated energetic
transactions and transformations of eternally conserving
evolutionary events. Though
almost all the involved geometries were long well known,
they had always been quantized
in terms of the cube as volumetric unity and its edges
as linear unity; when employed in
evaluating the other polyhedra, this method produced
such a disarray of irrational fraction
values as to imply that the other polyhedra were only
side-show geometric freaks or, at
best, "interesting aesthetic objets d'art." That secondpowering
exists today in academic
brains only as "squaring" and thirdpowering only as
cubing is manifest in any scientific
blackboard discourse, as the scientists always speak
of the x<SUP>2</SUP> they have just used as "x
squared" and likewise always account x<SUP>3</SUP> as "x cubed"
(see drawings section).

 <B>Foldability of Vector Equilibrium Four Great-Circle
Bow Ties: </B> All of
the set of four great circles uniquely and discretely
describing the vector equilibrium can
be folded out of four whole (non-incised), uniformradius,
circular discs of paper, each
folded radially in 60-degree central angle increments,
with two diametric folds, mid-circle,
hinge-bent together and locked in radial congruence
so that their six 60-degree arc edges
form two equiangled spherical triangles, with one common
radius-pairing fastened
together at its external apex, that look like a <I>bow
tie.</I> The pattern corresponds to the
external arc trigonometry, with every third edgefold
being brought into congruence to
form great-circle-triangled openings at their top with
their pointed lower ends all
converging ice-cream-cone-like at the center of the
whole uncut and only radially folded
great circles. When the four bow ties produced by the
folded circles are assembled
together by radii congruence and locking of each of
their four outer bow-tie corners to the
outer bow-tie corners of one another, they will reestablish
the original four great-circle
edge lines of the vector equilibrium and will accurately
define both its surface arcs and its
central angles as well as locating the vector-equilibrium
axes of symmetry of its three
subsets of great-circle-arc-generating to produce, all
told, 25 great circles of symmetry.
When assembled with their counterpart foldings of a
total number corresponding to the
great-circle set involved, they will produce a whole
sphere in which all of the original great
circles are apparently restored to their completely
continuing-around-the-sphere integrity.

 The sum of the areas of the four great-circle discs
elegantly equals the
surface area of the sphere they define. The area of
one circle is <IMG SRC="../figs/pi.gif">r<SUP>2</SUP>.
 The area of the surface
of a sphere is 4<IMG SRC="../figs/pi.gif">r<SUP>2</SUP>.
The area of the combined four folded
great-circle planes is also 4<IMG SRC="../figs/pi.gif">r<SUP>2</SUP>
and all four great-circle planes go through the exact
center of the sphere and, between
them, contain no volume at all. The sphere contains
the most volume with the least surface
enclosure of any geometrical form. This is a cosmic
limit at maximum. Here we witness
the same surface with no volume at all, which qualifies
the vector equilibrium as the most
economic nuclear "nothingness" whose coordinate conceptuality
rationally accommodates
all radiational and gravitational interperturbational
transformation accounting. In the four
great-circle planes we witness the same surface area
as that of the sphere, but containing
no volume at all. This too, is cosmic limit at zero
minimumness.

 It is to be noted that the four great-circle planes
of the vector equilibrium
passing exactly through its and one another's exact
centers are parallel to the four planes
of the eight tetrahedra, which they accommodate in the
eight triangular bow-tie
concavities of the vector equilibrium. The four planes
of the tetrahedra have closed on one
another to produce a tetrahedron of no volume and no
size at all congruent with the
sizeless center of the sphere defined by the vector
equilibrium and its four hexagonally
intersected planes. As four points are the minimum necessary
to define the insideness and
outsideness unique to all systems, four triangular facets
are the minimum required to
define and isolate a system from the rest of Universe.

all the points in Universe, traveling
either convexly or concavely. The physical-energy travel
patterns can either follow the
great-circle routes from sphere to sphere or go around

eights on one sphere. Either is permitted and accommodated.

 In the vector equilibrium's six great-circle bow ties,
all the internal, i.e.,
central angles of 70&deg; 32' and 54&deg; 44', are those of the
surface angles of the vector
equilibrium's four great-circle bow ties, and vice versa.
This phenomenon of turning the
inside central angles outwardly and the outside surface
angles inwardly, with various
fractionations and additions, characterizes the progressive
transformations of the vector
equilibrium from one greatcircle foldable group into
another, into its successive stages of
the spherical cube and octahedron with all of their
central and surface angles being both 90
degrees even.

 <B> Foldability of 12 Great Circles into Vector Equilibrium:</B>

trigonometry all the surface and central angles of both
the associated and separate groups
of 3<SUP>&#95;&#95;</SUP> 4<SUP>&#95;&#95;</SUP> 6<SUP>&#95;&#95;</SUP> 12
great circles of the vector equilibrium's
25 great circles, we can lay out
the spherical arcs which always subtend the central
angles. The 25 great circles interfere
with and in effect "bounce off" or penetrate one another
in an omnitriangulated,
nonredundant spherical triangle grid. Knowing the central
angles, we can lay them out and
describe foldable triangles in such a way that they
make a plurality of tetrahedra that
permit and accommodate fastening together edge-to-edge
with no edge duplication or
overlap. When each set, 312, of the vector equilibrium
is completed, its components may
be associated with one another to produce complete spheres
with their respective great-
circle, 360-degree integrity reestablished by their
arc increment association.

 The 25 folded great-circle sections join togetha to
reestablish the 25 great
circles. In doing so, they provide a plurality of 360-degree
local and long-distance travel
routes. Because each folded great circle starts off
with a 360-degree disc, it maintains that
360-degree integrity when folded into the bow-tie complexes.
It is characteristic of
electromagnetic wave phenomena that a wave must retum
upon itself, completing a 360-
degree circuit. The great-circle discs folded or flat
provide unitary-wave-cycle
circumferential circuits. Therefore, folded or not,
they act like waves coming back upon
themselves in a perfect wave control. We find their
precessional cyclic sdf-interferences
producing angular resultants that shunt themselves into
little local 360-degree, bow-tie
"holding patterns." The entire behavior is characteristic
of generalized wave phenomena.

 In the case of the 12 great circles of the vector
equilibrium, various complex
transformative, anticipatory accommodations are manifest,
such as that of the 12 sets of
two half-size pentagons appearing in the last, most
complex great-circle set of the vector
equilibrium, which anticipates the formation of 12 whole
pentagons in the six great-circle
set of the 31 great circles of the icosahedron into
which the vector equilibrium first
