 The "jitterbug" is the finitely closed, external vector
structuring of a vector-
equilibrium model constructed with 24 struts, each representing
the push-pull, action-and-
reaction, local compression vectors, all of them cohered
tensionally to one another's ends
by flexible joints that carry only tension across themselves,
so that the whole system of
only-locally-effective compression vectors is comprehensively
cohered by omniembracing
continuous four closed hexagonal cycles' tension.

 When the vector-equilibrium "jitterbug" assembly of
eight triangles and six
squares is opened, it may be hand-held in the omnisymmetry
conformation of the vector
equilibrium "idealized nothingness of absolute middleness."
If one of the vector
equilibrium's triangles is held by both hands in the
following manner<SUP>&#95;&#95;</SUP>with that triangle
horizontal and parallel to and above a tabletop; with
one of its apexes pointed away from
the holder and the balance of the jitterbug system dangling
symmetrically; with the
opposite and lowest triangle, opposite to the one held,
just parallel to and contacting the
tabletop, with one of its apexes pointed toward the
individual who is handholding the
jitterbug<SUP>&#95;&#95;</SUP>and then the top triangle is deliberately
lowered toward the triangle resting on
the table without allowing either the triangle on the
table or the triangle in the operator's
hands to rotate (keeping hands clear of the rest of
the system), the whole vector
equilibrium array will be seen to be both rotating equatorially,
parallel to the table but not
rotating its polar-axis triangles, the top one of which
the operating individual is hand-
lowering, while carefully avoiding any horizontal rotation
of, the top triangle in respect to
which its opposite triangle, resting frictionally on
the table, is also neither rotating
horizontally nor moving in any direction at all.

 While the equatorial rotating results from the top
triangle's rotationless
lowering, it will also be seen that the whole vector-equilibrium
array is contracting
symmetrically, that is, all of its 12 symmetrically
radiated vertexes move synchronously
and symmetrically toward the common volumetric center
of the spherically chorded vector
equilibrium. As it contracts comprehensively and always
symmetrically, it goes through a
series of geometricaltransformation stages. It becomes
first an icosahedron and then an
octahedron, with all of its vertexes approaching one
another symmetrically and without
twisting its axis.

 At the octahedron stage of omnisymmetrical contraction,
all the vectors
(strut edges) are doubled together in tight parallel,
with the vector equilibrium's 24 struts
now producing two 12-strut-edged octahedra congruent
with one another. If the top
triangle of the composite octahedron (which is the triangle
hand-held from the start, which
had never been rotated, but only lowered with each of
its three vertexes approaching
exactly perpendicularly toward the table) is now rotated
60 degrees and lowered further,
the whole structural system will transform swiftly into
a tetrahedron with its original 24
edges now quadrupled together in the six-edge pattern
of the tetrahedron, with four
tetrahedra now congruent with one another. Organic chemists
would describe it as a
quadrivalent tetrahedral structure.

 Finally, the model of the tetrahedron turns itself
inside out and oscillates
between inside and outside phases. It does this as three
of its four triangular faces hinge
open around its base triangle like a flower bud's petals
opening and hinging beyond the
horizontal plane closing the tetrahedron bud below the
base triangle.

 As the tetrahedron is opened again to the horizontal
four-triangle condition,
the central top triangle may again be lifted, and the
whole contractive sequence of events
from vector equilibrium to tetrahedron is reversed;
the system expands after attaining the
octahedral stage. When lifting of the topheld, nonhorizontally
rotated triangle has resulted
in the whole system expanding to the vector equilibrium,
the equatorial rotational
momentum will be seen to carry the rotation beyond dead-center,
and the system starts to
contract itself again. If the operating individual accommodates
this momentum trend and
again lowers the top triangle without rotating it horizontally,
the rotation will reverse its
original direction and the system will contract through
its previous stages but with a new
mix of doubled-up struts. As the lowering and raising
of the top triangle is continuously in
synchronization with the rotatingcontracting-expanding,
the rotation changes at the vector
equilibrium's "zero"<SUP>&#95;&#95;</SUP>this occasions the name jitterbug.
The vector equilibrium has four
axial pairs of its eight triangular faces, and at each
pair, there are different mixes of the
same struts.

 The jitterbug employs only the external vectors of
the vector equilibrium and
not its 12 internal radii. They were removed as a consequence
of observing the structural
stability of 12 spheres closest packed around a nuclear
sphere. When the nuclear sphere is
removed or mildly contracted, the 12 balls rearrange
themselves (always retaining their
symmetry) in the form of the icosahedron. Removal of
the radial vectors permitted
contraction of the model<SUP>&#95;&#95;</SUP>and its own omnisymmetrical
pulsation when the lowering and
raising patterns are swiftly repeated. It will be seen
that the squares accommodate the
jitterbug contractions by transforming first into two
equiangular triangles and then
disappearing altogether. The triangles do not change
through the transformation in size or
angularity. The original eight triangles of the vector
equilibrium are those of the
octahedron stage, and they double together to form the
four faces of the tetrahedron.

 If the vector equilibrium is constructed with circumferential
vectors only and
joined with flexible connectors, it will contract symmetrically,
due to the instability of the
square faces. This contraction is identical to the contraction
of the concentric sphere
packing when the nuclear sphere is removed. The squares
behave as any four balls will do
in a plane. They would like to rest and become a diamond,
to get into two triangles. They
took up more room as a square, and closer packing calls
for a diamond. The 12 vertexes
of the vector equilibrium simply rotate and compact
a little. The center ball was keeping
them from closer packing, so there is a little more
compactibility when the center ball goes
out.

 <B>Icosahedron:</B> The icosahedron occurs when the square
faces are no longer
squares but have become diamonds. The diagonal of the
square is considerably longer than
its edges. But as we rotate the ridge pole, the diamonds
become the same length as the
edge of the square (or, the same length as the edge
of the tetrahedron or the edge of the
octahedron). It becomes the octahedron when all 30 edges
are the same length. There are
no more squares. We have a condition of omnitriangulation.

 We discover that an icosahedron is the first degree
of contraction of the
vector equilibrium. We never catch the vector equilibrium
in its true existence in reality: it
is always going one way or the other. When we go to
the icosahedron, we get to great
realities. In the icosahedron, we get to a very prominent
fiveness: around every vertex you
can always count five.

 The icosahedron contracts to a radius less than the
radii of the vector
equilibrium from which it derived. There is a sphere
that is tangent to the other 12 spheres
at the center of an icosahedron, but that sphere is
inherently smaller. Its radius is less than
the spheres in tangency which generate the 12 vertexes
of the vector equilibrium or
icosahedron. Since it is no longer the same-size sphere,
it is not in the same frequency or
in the same energetic dimensioning. The two structures
are so intimate, but they do not
have the same amount of energy. For instance, in relation
to the tetrahedron as unity, the
volume of the icosahedron is 18.51 in respect to the
vector equilibrium's volume of 20.
The ratio is tantalizing because the mass of the electron
in respect to the mass of the
neutron is one over 18.51. That there should be such
an important kind of seemingly
irrational number provides a strong contrast to all
the other rational data of the
tetrahedron as unity, the octahedron as four, the vector
equilibrium as 20, and the rhombic
dodecahedron as six: beautiful whole rational numbers.

 The icosahedron goes out of rational tunability due
to its radius being too
little to permit it having the same-size nuclear sphere,
therefore putting it in a different
frequency system. So when we get into atoms, we are
dealing in each atom having its
unique frequencies.

 In the symmetrical jitterbug contraction, the top
triangle does not rotate. Its
vertex always points toward the mid-edge of the opposite
triangle directly below it. As the
sequence progresses, the top triangle approaches the
lower as a result of the system's
contraction. The equator of the system twists and transforms,
while the opposite triangles
always approach each other rotationlessly. They are
the polar group.

 <B>Octahedron:</B> When the jitterbug progresses to the point
where the vector
edges have doubled up, we arrive at the octahedron.
At this stage, the top triangle can be
pumped up and down with the equatorial vectors being
rotated first one way and then the
other. There is a momentum of spin that throws a twist
into the system<SUP>&#95;&#95;</SUP>positive and
negative. The right-hand octahedron and the left-hand
octahedron are not the same: if we
were to color the vectors to identify them, you would

different octahedra.

quadrivalent. The eight tetrahedra of the original vector

 We have arrived at the tetrahedron as a straight precessional
result. The
quadrivalent tetrahedron is the limit case of contraction
that unfolds and expands again
symmetrically only to contract once more to become the
other tetrahedron (like the
pumping of the positive and negative octahedron). All
of the jitterbug sequence was
accomplished within the original domain of the vector
equilibrium. The tensional integrity
survives within the internal affairs domain of atoms.

 Only by recognizing the deceptiveness of Eulerean
topology can synergetics
account for the primitive total inventories of all aspects
and thus conceptually demonstrate
and prove the validity of Boltzmann's concepts as well
as those of all quantum
phenomena. Synergetics mathematical accounting conceptually
interlinks the operational
data of physics and chemistry and their complex associabilities
manifest in such disciplines
as geology, biology, and others.
