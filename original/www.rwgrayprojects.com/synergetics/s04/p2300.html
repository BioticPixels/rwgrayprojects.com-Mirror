 In the octet truss system, all the vectors are of
identical length and all the
angles around any convergence are the same. The patterns
repeat themselves consistently.
At every internal convergence, there are always 12 vectors
coming together, and they are
always convergent at 60 degrees with respect to the
next adjacent ones.

 There are angles other than 60-degrees generated in
the system, as for
instance the square equatorial mid-section of the octahedron.
These angles of other than
60-degrees occur between nonadjacently converging vectorial
connectors of the system.
The prime structural relationship is with the 60 degree
angle.

 Fundamental 60-degree coordination operates either

 <B>Spherics:</B> Employing the rhombic dodecahedron as the
hub at the vector
crossings of the octet truss (the isotropic vector matrix)
provides unique economic,
technical, and geometric advantages: its 12 facets represent
the six pairs of planes
perpendicular to the six degrees of freedom. (See Sec.
<A HREF="../s05/p3700.html#537.10">537.10</A>.)
Its 12 diamond faces also
provide the even-numbered means of allowing the vectors
to skew-weave around the
nucleus at critical-proximity distances without touching
the nucleus or one another.
Because two or more lines cannot go through the same
point at the same time, this
function of the rhombic dodecahedron's hub makes all
the difference between regenerative
success or failure of Universe.

 Multiplying wavelength by frequency equals the speed
of light. We have two
experimentally demonstrable radiational variables. We
have to do whatever we do against
time. Whatever <I>we</I> may be, each <I>we</I> has only so much commonly
experienceable time in
scenario Universe within which to articulate thus and
so. Therefore, the vector
equilibrium's radiant or gravitational "realizations"
are always inherently geared to or
tuned in with the fundamental time-sizing of = 186,000
mps (approximately), which unique time-size-
length increments of available time can be divided into
any desirable frequency. One
second is a desirable, commonly experienceable increment
to use, and within each unit of
it we can reach = 186,000 miles (approximately) in any non-frequency-interferedwith
direction.

 Wavelength times frequency is the speed of all radiation.
If the frequency of
the vector equilibrium is four, its vector radius, or
basic wavelength = 186,000 / 4 miles
reachable within one second = 46,500 reach-miles. Electromagnetically
speaking, the
unarticulated vector equilibrium's onesecond vector
length is always 186,282.396 miles.

 All the relative volumetric intervaluations of all

of all uniradius, closest-packed spheres are inherently
regenerated in omnirational respect

activated by the size-selective, metaphysical-consideration
initiatives, whether they are
objectively and physically articulated in consciously

whether they are selectively tuned to receive on that
isotropic-vector-matrix-defined
"wavelength."

 Humans may be quite unconscious of their unavoidable
employment of
isotropic vector matrix fields of thought or of physical
articulations; and they may
oversimplify or be only subconsciously attuned to employ
their many cosmically
intertunable faculties and especially their conceptual
and reasoning faculties. However,
their physical brains, constituted of quadrillions times
quadrillions of atoms, are always
and only most economically interassociative, interactive,
and intertransforming only in
respect to the closestpacked isotropic vector matrix
fields which altogether subconsciously
accommodate the conceptual geometry picturing and memory
storing of each individual's
evolutionary accumulation of special-case experience
happenings, which human
inventories are accumulatingly stored isotropic-vector-matrix
wise in the brain and are
conceptually retrievable by brain and are both subconsciously
and consciously
reconsidered reflexively or by reflex-shunning mind.
