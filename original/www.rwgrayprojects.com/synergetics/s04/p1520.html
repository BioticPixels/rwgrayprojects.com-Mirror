 The first closest-packed, omnitriangulated, ergo structurally
stabilized, but
non-nuclear, equiradius-sphered, cubical agglomeration
has 14 spheres. This may be
Carbon 14, which is the initially closest-packed, omnisymmetrical,
polyhedral
fourteenness, providing further closest-packability
surface nests suitable for structurally
mounting hydrogen atoms to produce all organic matter.

 The cube is the prime minimum omnisymmetrical allspace
filler. But the cube
is nonstructural until its six square faces are triangularly
diagonaled. When thus
triangularly diagonaled, it consists of one tetrahedron
with four one-eighth octahedra, of
three isosceles and one equilateral-faced tetrahedron,
outwardly applied to the nuclear
equilateral tetrahedron's four triangular faces. Thus
structurally constituted, the
superficially faced cube is prone to closest-packing
self-associability. In order to serve as
the carbon ring (with its six-sidedness), the cube of
14 spheres (with its six faces) could be
joined with six other cubes by single atoms nestable
in its six square face centers, which
singleness of sphericity linkage potential is providable
by Hydrogen 1.

 In the atoms, we are always dealing in equiradius
spheres. Chemical
compounds may, and often do, consist of atomic spheres
with a variety of radial
dimensions. Since each chemical element's atoms are
characterized by unique frequencies,
and unique frequencies impose unique radial symmetries,
this variety of radial
dimensionality constitutes one prime difference between
nuclear physics and chemistry.

 <B> Begetted Eightness:</B> The "begetted" <I>eightness</I> as the
system-limit number of
nuclear uniqueness of self-regenerative symmetrical
growth may well account for the
fundamental octave of unique interpermutative integer
effects identified as plus one, plus
two, plus three, plus four, as the interpermutated effects
of the integers one, two, three,
and four, respectively; and as minus four, minus three,
minus two, minus one,
characterizing the integers five, six, seven, and eight,
respectively. The integer nine always
has a neutral, or zero, intermutative effect on the
other integers. This permutative,
synergetic or interamplifying or dimensioning effect
of integers upon integers, together
with the octave interinsulative accommodation produced
by the zero effect of the
nineness, is discussed experientially in our section
on <I>Indigs</I> in Chapter 12, Numerology.

 The inherent zero-disconnectedness accounts for the
finite energy packaging
and discontinuity of Universe. The vector equilibria
are the empty set tetrahedra of
Universe, i.e., the tetrahedron, being the minimum structural
system of Universe
independent of size, its four facet planes are at maximum
remoteness from their opposite
vertexes and may have volume content of the third power
of the linear frequency. Whereas
in the vector equilibrium all four planes of the tetrahedra
pass through the same opposite
vertex<SUP>&#95;&#95;</SUP>which is the nuclear vertex<SUP>&#95;&#95;</SUP>and have no volume,
frequency being zero: F<SUP>0</SUP>.

 <B>Vector-Equilibrium Closest-Packing Configurations:</B>
The vector
equilibrium has four unique sets of axes of symmetry:
<OL TYPE="1">
<LI> The three intersymmetrical axes perpendicular to,
i.e., normal to, i.e., joining,
the hemispherically opposite six square faces;
<LI>The four axes normal to its eight triangular faces;
<LI>The six axes normal to its 12 vertexes; and
<LI> the 12 axes normal to its 24 edges.
</OL>
The tetrahedron, vector equilibrium, and octahedron,
with all their planes parallel to those
of the tetrahedron, and therefore derived from the tetrahedron,
as the first and simplest
closest-packed, ergo omnitriangulated, symmetrical structural
system, accept further
omnidirectional closest packing of spheres. Because
only <I>eight</I> of its 20 planar facets are
ever parallel to the four planes of the icosahedron,
the icosahedron refuses angularly to
accommodate anywhere about its surface further omnidirectional
closest packing of spheres, as does the tetrahedron.

 Consequently, the (no-nucleus-accommodating) icosahedron
formed of
equiradius, triangularly closest-packed spheres occurs
only as a one-sphere-thick shell of
any frequency only. While the icosahedron cannot accommodate
omnidirectionally closest-
packed multishell growth, it can be extended from any
one of its triangular faces by
closest-packed sphere agglomerations. Two icosahedra
can be face-bonded.

corner spheres of
triangular closest packing.

parallel to the set of four axes of symmetry of the
vector equilibrium. Therefore, the
icosahedron may be face-extended to produce chain patterns
conforming to the
tetrahedron, octahedron, vector equilibrium, and rhombic
dodecahedron in
omnidirectional, closest-packing coordination<SUP>&#95;&#95;</SUP> but only
as chains; for instance, as open
linear models of the octahedron's edges, etc.

 <B>Nucleus and Nestable Configurations in Tetrahedra:</B>
In any number of
successive planar layers of tetrahedrally organized
sphere packings, every third triangular
layer has a sphere at its centroid (nucleus). The dark
ball rests in the valley between three
balls, where it naturally falls most compactly and comfortably.
The next layer is three balls
to the edge, which means two-frequency. There are six
balls in the third layer, and there
very clearly is a nest right in the middle. There are
ten balls in the fourth layer: but we
cannot nest a ball in the middle because it is already
occupied by a dark centroid ball.
Suddenly the pattern changes, and it is no longer nestable.

 At first, we have a dark ball at the top; then a second
layer of three balls with
a nest but no nucleus. The third layer with six balls
has a nest but no nucleus. The fourth
layer with ten balls has a dark centroid ball at the
nucleus but no nestable position in the
middle. The fifth layer (five balls to the edge; four
frequency) has 15 balls with a nest
again, but no nucleus. This 35 sphere tetrahedron with
five spheres on each edge is the
lowest frequency tetrahedron system that has a central
sphere or nucleus. (See Fig. A,

 <B> Basic Nestable Configurations: </B> There are three basic

octahedron of seven spheres; and (3) the quarter tetrahedron,
with a 16th sphere nesting
on a planar layer of 15 spheres. Note that this "nesting"
is only possible on triangular
arrays that have no sphere at their respective centroids.
This series is a prime hierarchy.
One sphere on three is the first possibility with a
central nest available. One sphere on six
is the next possibility with an empty central nest available.
One sphere on 10 is impossible
as a ball is already occupying the geometrical center.
The next possibility is one on 15 with
a central empty nest available.

 Note that the 20-ball empty set (see Fig. B, illustration

five sets of four-ball simplest tetrahedra and can be
assembled from five separate
tetrahedra. The illustration shows four four-ball tetrahedra
at the vertexes colored
"white." The fifth four-ball tetrahedron is dark colored
and occupies the central octahedral
space in an inverted position. In this arrangement,
the four dark balls of the inverted
central tetrahedron appear as center balls in each of
the four 10-ball tetrahedral faces.
