 Though I have found an omnidirectional vector equilibrium
matrix and the
complex of momentarily positively and negatively asymmetrical
intertransformabilities
pulsating through the equilibrious state, I knew that
nature would never allow temporal
humans to omniarrest cosmic kinetics at the timeless,
i.e., eternal equilibrium zero. But
experimenting in cryogenics, taking energy-as-heat out
of the insulatingly isolated
liquefied gaseous element system approaching absolute
zero, we learn that as the
temperature gets lower and lower, an increasingly orderly
and an increasingly symmetrical,
microgeometrical patterning occurs<SUP>&#95;&#95;</SUP>the Platonic solids
appear to become more
symmetrically uniform. Contrariwise, when energy-as-heat
is progressively reintroduced,
the kinetics increase and the complex of conceptual
behavior becomes progressively
asymmetric. At lowest cryogenic temperatures the omnigrametric
interpatterning
approaches isotropic vector matrix equilibrium.

 The progressive energy-starving experimental strategy
reveals that nature
always transforms through, and relative centrally to,
the omni-isotropic-vector-matrix
equilibrium, while kinetically emphasizing the mildly
off-center asymmetric aspects.
Nature grows her crystals positively or negatively askew<SUP>&#95;&#95;</SUP>she
twists and spirals around
the local, three-way great-circle grid systems in the
alternate positive-negative geodesic

 The isotropic vector matrix equilibrium multiplies
omnidirectionally with
increasing frequency of concentric, vector-equilibrium-conformed,
closest-packed
uniradius sphere shells, conceptually disclosing the
cosmically prime unique sequence of
developed interrelationships and behaviors immediately
surrounding a prime nucleus.
While the physicist processes his nuclear problems with
nonconceptual mathematics, the
conceptual isotropic vector matrix equilibria model
provides a means of comprehending all
the electromagnetic and nonelectromagnetic energy valving
and angular shunting controls
of the solid state transistors.

 With one layer of spheres around the nuclear sphere
we will get one set of
angular interrelationships of the surrounding spheres
with the nucleus and with one
another. With two layers of spheres around the nuclear
sphere a different angular
relationship between the nuclear sphere and its intersurrounding
spheres occurs (see Sec.
<A HREF="p1500.html#415.00">415</A>).
At the third layer of enclosure some of the angular
interrelationship patternings
begin to repeat themselves. Thus we are able to in ventory

nuclear set of unique interrelationship patterns.</I>

 The isotropic vector matrix multiplies concentrically.
But because vectors
are discrete, the isotropic vector matrix's lines do
not go to infinity. Their length must
always represent sum-totally the total energy of eternally
regenerative physical Universe.
No matter how high the internal frequency of finite
Universe, the overall vector
equilibrium is of unit magnitude. This magnitude corresponds
to that of the speed of
radiation uninterfered with in vacuo. We find that the
different frequencies in their phases
of symmetry identify precisely with what we now call
the Magic Numbers identifying the
successively reoccurring five peaks in relative abundance
of atomic isotopes. (See Sec.

 Science evolved the name "solid state" physics when,
immediately after
World War II, the partial conductors and partial resistors<SUP>&#95;&#95;</SUP>later
termed "transistors"<SUP>&#95;&#95;</SUP>
were discovered. The phenomena were called "solid state"
because, without human
devising of the electronic circuitry, certain small
metallic substances accidentally disclosed
electromagnetic pattern-holding, shunting, route-switching,
and frequency-valving
regularities, assumedly produced by the invisible-to-humans
atomic complexes constituting
those substances. Further experiment disclosed unique
electromagnetic circuitry
characteristics of various substances without any conceptual
model of the "subvisible
apparatus." Ergo, the whole development of the use of
these invisible behaviors was
conducted as an intelligently resourceful trial-and-error
strategy in exploiting invisible and
uncharted-by-humans natural behavior within the commonsensically
"solid" substances.
The addition of the word "state" to the word "solid"
implied "regularities" in an otherwise
assumedly random conglomerate. What I have discovered
goes incisively and conceptually
deeper than the blindfolded assumptions and strategies
of solid state physics<SUP>&#95;&#95;</SUP> whose
transistors' solid state regularities seemingly defied
discrete conceptuality and scientific
generalization and kinetic omnigramming.

 The atomically furnished isotropic vector matrix can
be described as an
omnidirectional matrix of "lights," as the four-dimensional
counterpart of the two-
dimensional light-bulb-matrix of the Broadway-and-Forty-secondStreet,
New York City
billboards with their fields of powerful little light
bulbs at each vertex which are controlled
remotely off-and-on in intensity as well as in color.
Our four-dimensional, isotropic vector
matrix will display all the atom "stars" concentrically
matrixed around each isotropic
vector equilibrium's nuclear vertex. By "lighting" the
atoms of which they consist,
humans' innermost guts could be illustrated and illuminated.
Automatically turning on all
the right lights at the right time, atomically constituted,
center-of-being light, "you," with
all its organically arranged "body" of lights omnisurrounding
"you," could move through
space in a multidimensional way just by synchronously
activating the same number of
lights in the same you-surrounding pattern, with all
the four-dimensional optical effect (as
with two-dimensional, planar movies), by successively
activating each of the lights from
one isotropic vector vertex to the next, with small,
local "movement" variations of "you"
accomplished by special local matrix sequence programmings.

 We could progressively and discretely activate each

four-dimensional isotropic vector matrix to become "lights,"
and could move a
multidimensional control "form" through the isotropic
multidimensional circuitry

a "vector equilibrium," or any other
system including complex you-and-me, et al. This multidimensional
scanning group of
points can be programmed multidimensionally on a computer

concentric spherical cluster of four-dimensional "light"
points can be progressively "turned

 This indeed may be what Universe is doing! Employing
a scanner of each of
our atoms, this is one way humans could have been radio-transmitted
and put aboard
Earth from any place in Universe. The naked human eye
cannot differentiate visually the
separate dots of a matrix when their frequency of uniform-moduled
spaced occurrence is
greater than one hundred to the linear inch, or ten
thousand to the square inch, or one
million to the cubic inch. Let us radiantly activate
isotropically and modularly grouped
local atoms of a human's physical organism in such a
manner that only one million per
cubic inch out of all the multibillions of actual atoms
per cubic inch of which humans
consist, are radiationally, ergo visibly, activated.
The human, thus omni-internally
illumined by the local one-in-one-million atomic "street
lamps," could be realistically
scanned by discrete "depth-sounding" devices and programmed
to move "visibly" through
an omnidimensional, highfrequency, isotropic light matrix
field "mass."

 It is called the vector equilibrium because the radials
and the circumferentials
are all of the same dimension and the tendencies to
both explode and implode are
symmetrical. That the explosive and implosive forces
are equal is shown by the four-
dimensional hexagonal cross sections whose radial and
circumferential vectoM balance.
The eight triangular faces reveal four opposite pairs
of single-bonded tetrahedra in a
positive and negative tetrahedral system array with
a common central vertex and with
coinciding radial edges. The four hexagonal planes that
cross each other at the center of
the vector-equilibrium system are parallel to the four
faces of each of its eight tetrahedra.
Six square faces occur where the six half-octahedra
converge around the common vector-
equilibrium nuclear vertex.

thrust of the vector
equilibrium is exactly balanced by the circumferentially
restraining chordal forces: hence
the figure is an equilibrium of vectors. All the edges
of the figure are of equal length, and
this length is always the same as the distance of any
of its vertexes from the center of the

equilibrium of forces in which the

of its contractive shrinkage is
exactly matched by its external compressive archwork's

 The vector equilibrium makes it possible to make conceptual
models of
fourth-, fifth-, and sixth-dimensional omniexpeAence
accounting by using tetrahedroning.
If we have a volume of 20 around a point, then two to
the fourth power (16) plus two to
the second power (4) equals 20. We can then accommodate
these powerings around a
single point.

 Using frequency to the third power with a no-frequency
nucleus, the vector
equilibrium models all of the first four primes. For
instance, the number 48 (in 480) is 16 &#215;
3. Three is a prime number, and 16 is two to the fourth
power: that is 48, and then times
10. Ten embraces the prime numbers five times the number
two; so instead of having 16
times 2, we can call it 32, which is two to the fifth
power. The whole 480-moduled vector
equilibrium consists of the prime number one times two
to the fifth
power, times three, times five (1 &#215; 2<SUP>5</SUP> &#215; 3 &#215; 5). These
are the first four prime numbers.

 Using frequency to the third power with a two-frequency
nucleus, we have
2<SUP>3</SUP>&#215;2<SUP>5</SUP> = 2<SUP>8</SUP>. If the frequency is two, we have two to
the eighth power in the model times
three times five (2<SUP>8</SUP> &#215; 3 &#215; 5).

 In a three-frequency system, we would have three to
the third power times
three, which makes three to the fourth power, which
we would rewrite as 2<SUP>5</SUP> &#215; 3<SUP>4</SUP> &#215; 5. We
get two kinds of four-dimensionality in here. There
is a prime dimensionality of three to
the fourth power (3<SUP>4</SUP>). And there is another kind of
four-dimensionality if the frequency is
four, which would be written 2<SUP>5</SUP> &#215; 3 &#215; 5. But since it
is frequency to the third power, and
since four is two times two (2 &#215; 2) or two to the second
power (2<SUP>2</SUP>), we would add two to
make two to the seventh power (2<SUP>7</SUP>), resulting in 2<SUP>7</SUP>
&#215; 3 &#215; 5. If the frequency is five, it
would then be two to the fifth power (2<SUP>5</SUP>) times three,
because frequency is to the third
power times five, which makes five to the fourth power.
Quite obviously,
multidimensionality beyond three dimensions is experienceably,
i.e., conceptually,
modelable in synergetics accounting.

 The unique and constantly remote but-always-and-only
co-occurring
geometrical "starry" surroundment "outsideness" of the
nucleated vector equilibrium is
always an icosahedron, but always occurring only as
a single layer of vertexes of the same
frequency as that of the nuclear vector equilibrium's
outermost vertexial layer.

 There may be multilayer vector equilibria<SUP>&#95;&#95;</SUP>two-frequency,
threefrequency,
four-frequency, or whatever frequency. The circumferential
vector frequency will always
be identical to that of its radial vector frequency
contraction of the vector equilibrium's
outer layer of unit radius spheres by local surface
rotation of that outer layer's six square
arrays of non-closest-singlelayer packing of tangent
spheres inter-rearranging into closest
triangular packing as in the vector equilibrium's eight
triangular facets, thus transforming
the total outer layer into the icosahedron of equal
outer edge length to that of the vector
equilibrium, but of lesser interior radius than the
vector equilibrium of the same outer edge
length, and therefore of lesser interior volume than
that of the vector equilibrium, ergo
unable to accommodate the same number of interiorally-closest-packed,
nuclear-sphere-
centered unit radius spheres as that of the vector equilibrium.
The icosahedron's
multifrequenced outer layer surface arrays of unit radius,
closest-planar-packed spheres
cannot accommodate either concentric layers of unit
radius closest-packed spheres nor<SUP>&#95;&#95;</SUP>
even at zero frequency<SUP>&#95;&#95;</SUP>can the icosahedron's 12-ball,
omni-intertangentially triangulated
outer shell accommodate one nuclear sphere of the same
radius as that of its shell spheres.
Icosahedral outer shell arrays of identical frequency
to that of the vector equilibria of the
same frequency, can therefore only occur as single-layer,
symmetrical, enclosure arrays
whose individual spheres cannot be tangent to one another
but must be remotely
equipositioned from one another, thus to form an omni-intertriangulated,
icosahedrally
conformed starry array, remotely and omnisurroundingly
occupying the vector
equilibrium's sky at an omnistar orbit-permitting equidistance
remoteness around the
vector equilibrium whose outer shell number of spheres
exactly corresponds to the number
of the icosahedron's "stars." This geometrical dynamically
interpositioning integrity of
relationship strongly suggests the plurality of unique
electron shell behaviors of all the
chemical elements' atoms, and the identical number relationships
of the atoms' outer layer
protons and its electrons; and the correspondence of
the vector equilibrium's number of
concentric closest-packed, nucleus-enclosing layers
with the number of quantumjump-
spaced electron orbit shells; and finally the relative
volume relationship of equi-edged
vector equilibria and icosahedra, which is, respectively,
as 20 is to 18.51, which suggests
the relative masses of the proton and the electron,
which is as 1:1/1836.
