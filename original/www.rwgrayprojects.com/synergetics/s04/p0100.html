At the top of Illus. 401.01 (see also Illus. 401.00
in drawings section), we
see something like a ping-pong ball attached to a string.
The pingpong ball represents me,
and the string is gravity (or mass attraction), with
its other end tethered to a point that
represents all the rest of Universe that isn't me. Because
of mass attraction, the one thing
that I cannot do is escape absolutely from Universe.
I may try to exert terrific acceleration
and shoot out through a hole in the Galaxies, beyond
the Pleiades, where the stars
seemingly are so scarce that as I look back from fantastically
far out, all the stars of
Universe seem to be collected in approximately one bright
spot. The single string of the
model, long though it may be, represents the combined
mass attraction exerted upon me
by all the stars of Universe.

 <B>Tetherball:</B> There is an old game called tetherball,
played by tennis players
lacking a tennis court. There is a tennis ball fastened
powerfully to a strong, slender cord
19 feet long suspended from the top of a pole 22 feet
in height above the ground level.
There is a circular marker on the pole at the 11' 4"
height. The server bats the ball in a
clockwise circumferential direction around the pole,
attempting to wind its cord
completely around the pole above the 11' 4" mark. The
opponent can intercept and
attempt to wind the ball counterclockwise. Obviously,
a tethered ball on a long string is
free to describe any omnigeometric forms of circles,
spheres, or giraffes, but it cannot get
away from the Universe. This is called <I>one restraint:</I>
the fundamental "otherness" essential
to initial "awareness" of the observer. (Nothing to
observe: no awareness: only
nothingness.) Otherness always imposes a minimum of
one restraint, weak though it may
be, on all awareness, which is the beginning of "Life."

 But the imagined experience of cosmically long journeys
teaches me that the
possibility of finding such a hole in the celestial
myriadicity to attain such a unified
paralactic bunching of all island nebulae is a futile
search. Therefore, I resign myself to
acknowledgment of at least two a priori restraints that
inescapably affect my relative
cosmic freedom. Hoping to save myself vast cosmic time,
and accepting my present
position in Universe, I try to process the known data
on the mass dimensions of all the
known stars and try to divide them all into two opposite
hemispherical teams<SUP>&#95;&#95;</SUP>those to
my right and those to my left. Then assuming all the
right-hand hemisphere group's mass
attraction to be accumulatively resolved into one mass-attractive
restraint tied to my right
arm's wrist, and all the other cosmic hemisphere's equal
tensions tied to my left arm's
wrist, I find myself used like a middleman in a ropeless
tug of war, liable to have my arms
pulled out of my armpits. So I tie both the tension
lines around my waist. Now I am in the
same dynamic situation as a ping-pong ball suspended
in the middle of a one-string fiddle.
Because all strings, no matter how tautly strung, can
still vibrate, I can still move. But I
find that with two restraints I can move about in circles,
cloverleafs, or figures-of-eight,
but always and only in a plane that is perpendicular
to the string of which I am in the
middle.

 Now I conclude that the various motions of the stars
make it illogical to
assume any persistence of the two hemispherical star
sphere groupings. The star
accelerations produce the inertial advantage of awayness
to which my mass-attraction
tethers were attached. I therefore conclude that it
is more probable that such dynamic
inertia will persist in three groups. Now I have three
restraints, and the ping-pong ball
"me" acts as if it were in the middle of a drumhead,
or as tensilely suspended at the center
of area of a triangle by three strings fastened at the
triangle's corners. The ping-pong ball
"me" can still move, but only in a line perpendicular
to the plane of the drumhead or web
triangle. I am constrained by three converging lines
as I oscillate to and fro between the
opposite apexes of two dynamically described, base-to-base,
positive or negative
tetrahedra formed by the resonating drumhead's terminal
oscillations.

 With only one restraint, the ball was moving omnidirectionally
or
multidimensionally. With two restraints, it was moving
in a plane; with three restraints, it
moves only in a line. I now conclude that it is more
probable that I can concentrate all the
restraints operating upon me from all the stars because
of the multidirectional pull of all
the stars actually pulling me. I conclude that there
is much redundancy but that four
restraints is closer to a matter of reality than three
restraints. When we attach a fourth
restraint perpendicular to the center of the drumhead
and pull it only in the "fro" direction,
the ping-pong ball "me" seems at last to be immobilized.
With four restraints the ping-
pong ball "me" can no longer move either toward or away
from any other parts of the
Universe. But the ball can twist locally, that is, it
can rotate in place around an axis, and
that axis itself can incline at many angles, as does
the gyroscope top, without alteration of
its volumetric center position in respect to the four
vertexial star groups. Because the
vectors are coming together in nonequilateral quadrangles,
i.e., in trapeoids, the restraints
are not intertriangulated, and we have learned experimentally
that only triangles are stable.
(See Sec. <A HREF="../s06/p0900.html#610.00">610</A>, Triangulation.)
Therefore, it is possible
for the ball to "turbine," rotate, and
precess locally in place without altering the geometrical
position at volume center of the
celestial tetrahedron from whose four corners the four
vectors of restraint were imposed.
The six edges of the celestial spherical tetrahedron
represent the three mass-attraction
restraints imposed on each of the tetrahedron's four
corner mass centers as each being in
normal acceleration is precessionally restrained from
exiting from Universe. Each of the
four corners' group massiveness is restrained by all
three of the other tetrahedral corner
mass centers. Any one of the massmoment acceleration
tendencies to part company with
the others is overpowered three-to-one by the three
others. Thus the cohering integrity of
Universe is manifest to us by consideration of the celestial
advantage points from which
our four central restraints were mounted. Though the
ping-pong "me" ball can be twisted
and torqued in place, it cannot be moved from its tetrahedral
center position. To prevent
local in-position twist and torque, each of the four
corner tensional restraints will have to
be multiplyingly replaced by three restraints, all springing
from three external points at
each of the four tetrahedral corners; and each of the
three tensions from any one of the
four corners must cross the others triangularly and
be attached tangentially to the ball at
the center. These 12 now completely restrain any motion
of the central ball in relation to
the other four.

 The purpose of our investigation was to find the requirements
of a minimum
system. Our experimental model demonstrates that it
takes four vectors to define a point
with the ping-pong ball at the center of gravity and
center of volume of the regular
tetrahedron. It takes 12 such vectors to both position
and locally immobilize. It takes six
external push vectors and six external pull vectors
to define the minimum nuclear
structural system: a primary subdivision of Universe.
To summarize, the celestial
tetrahedron has six positive and six negative internal
vectors and six positive and six
negative external vectors.

 Four external "star" foci effecting complete immobilization
of the "me" ball
are the same four event foci that we learned earlier
(Sec. <A HREF="p0000.html#400.05">405.05</A>)
always constitute the
minimum number of events necessary to define the insideness
and outsideness of a system.

 <B>Tetherball:</B> In the "me" ball in Universe 12 structural
restraints are
necessary to eliminate all the degrees of freedom because
all the initial four restraints are
connected to the surface of the "me" sphere and not
to its center. The four points of
tangency describe a square, and they permit local twist
and torque because a square is
unstable. So each tension has to be replaced by three
tension restraints to produce a
tensegrity structure within which the "me" ball may
be omninonredundantly immobilized.

tetrahedron and a
second convex tetrahedron, plus a third tetrahedron
for all the Universe outside the
system-as-tetrahedron, and a fourth tetrahedron complementarily

Universe inside the system-as-tetrahedron. All the angles

 <B>Conceptuality:</B> Unstable systems are conceptual as
momentary positional
relationships of unstructured-component event aggregates;
for example, amongst the stars
comprising the Big Dipper<SUP>&#95;&#95;</SUP>in Ursa Major<SUP>&#95;&#95;</SUP>the second and
third stars in the dipper's
handle are, respectively, 100- and 200-light-years away
from Earth and, though seemingly
to us in the same plane, are not all so; and they are
both moving in opposite directions and
so in due course they will no longer seem to be in the
same constellation. In the same way,
four airplanes flying in different directions may be
within visible range of one another, but
are far too remote for mass inter-attraction to become
critical and pull them into one
another. Stable systems are conceptual as structured,
which means componently omni-
mtertriangulated critical-proximity, interrelevant,
coordinate, constellar event aggregates.

consideration proves to be unstable, it does not manifest
