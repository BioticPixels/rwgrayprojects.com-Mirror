 While its vertical radii are uniformly contracted
from the vector equilibrium's
vertexial radii, the icosahedron's surface is simultaneously
and symmetrically askewed
from the vector equilibrium's surface symmetry. The
vector equilibrium's eight triangles
do not transform, but its six square faces transform
into 12 additional triangles identical to
the vector equilibrium's original eight, with five triangles
cornered together at the same
original 12 vertexes of the vector equilibrium.

 The icosahedron's five-triangled vertexes have odd-number-imposed,
inherent interangle bisectioning, that is, extensions
of the 30 great circle edges of any of
the icosahedron's 20 triangles automatically bisecting
the apex angle of the adjacently
intruded triangle into which it has passed. Thus extension
of all the icosahedron's 20
triangles' 30 edges automatically bisects all of its
original 60 vertexial-centered,
equiangled 36-degree corners, with all the angle bisectors
inherently impinging
perpendicularly upon the opposite mid-edges of the icosahedron's
20 equilateral,
equiangled 72-degreecornered triangles. The bisecting
great-circle extensions from each of
all three of the original 20 triangles' apexes cross
inherently (as proven elsewhere in
Euclidian geometry) at the areal center of those 20
original icosahedral triangles. Those
perpendicular bisectors subdivide each of the original
20 equiangled triangles into six
right-angled triangles, which multiplies the total surface
subdivisioning into 120 "similar"
right-angled triangles, 60 of which are <I>positive</I> and
60 of which are <I>negative,</I> whose
corners in the spherical great-circle patterning are
90&deg;, 60&deg;, and 36&deg;, respectively, and
their chordally composed corresponding planar polyhedral
triangles are 90, 60, and 30
degrees, respectively. There is exactly 6 degrees of
"spherical excess," as it is formally
known, between the 120 spherical vs. 120 planar triangles.

 This positive-negative subdivision of the whole system
puts half the system
into negative phase and the other half into positive
phase, which discloses an exclusively
external "surface" positive-negative relationship quite
apart from that of the two surface
polar hemispheres. This new aspect of complementarity
is similar to the systematic
omnicoexistence of the concave and convex non-mirror-imaged
complementarity whose
concavity and convexity make the 60 positive and 60
negative surface triangle subdivisions
of spherical unity inherently noninterchangeable with
one another when turned inside out,
whereas they are interchangeable with one another by
insideouting when in their planar-
faceted polyhedral state.

 We thus find the split-phase positive-and-negativeness
of oddnumber-of-
vertexial-angle systems to be inherently askewed and
insideoutingly dichotomized
omnisymmetries. This surface phase of dichotomization
results in superficial, disorderly
interpatterning complementation. This superficially
disarrayed complementation is
disclosed when the 15 great circles produced by extension
of all 30 edges of the
icosahedron's 20 triangles are folded radially in conformity
to the central interangling of
the 120 triangles' spherical arc edges.

 The 15 great circles of the icosahedron interact to
produce 15 "chains" of
three varieties of four corner-to-corner, sausage-linked,
right triangles, with four triangles
in each chain. These 15 chains of 60 great-circle triangles
are each interconnectible corner-

into 120 similar spherical

 <B> Icosahedron as Contraction of Vector Equilibrium:</B>
The icosahedron
represents the 12-way, omniradially symmetrical, transformative,
rotational contraction of
the vector equilibrium. This can be seen very appropriately
when we join the 12 spheres
tangent to one another around a central nuclear sphere
in closest packing: this gives the
correspondence to the vector equilibrium with six square
faces and eight triangular faces,
all with 60degree internal angles. If we llad rubber
bands between the points of tangency
of those 12 spheres and then removed the center sphere,
we would find the 12 tangent
spheres contracting immediately and symmetrically into
the icosahedral conformation.

 The icosahedron is the vector equilibrium contracted
in radius so that the
vector equilibrium's six square faces become 12 ridge-pole
diamonds. The ridge-pole
lengths are the same as those of the 12 radii and the
24 outside edges. With each of the
former six square faces of the vector equilibrium now
turned into two equiangle triangles
for a total of 12, and with such new additional equiangled
and equiedged triangles added
to the vector equilibrium's original eight, we now have
20 triangles and no other surface
facets than the 20 triangles. Whereas the vector equilibrium
had 24 edges, we now have
added six more to the total polyhedral system as it
transforms from the vector equilibrium
into the icosahedron; the six additional ridge poles
of the diamonds make a total of 30
edges of the icosahedron. This addition of six vector
edge lengths is equivalent to one
great circle and also to one quantum.

 We picture the location of the vector equilibrium's
triangular faces in
relation to the icosahedron's triangular faces. The
vector equilibrium could contract
rotatively, in either positive or negative manner, with
the equator going either clockwise
or counterclockwise. Each contraction provides a different
superposition of the vector
equilibrium's triangular faces on the icosahedron's
triangular faces. But the centers of area
of the triangular faces remain coincidental and congruent.
They retain their common
centers of area as they rotate.

 We find that the 25 great circles of the icosahedron
each pass through the 12
vertexes corresponding to the 25 great circles of the

through the 12 vertexes, as the number of vertexes after
the rotational contraction remains

 <B> Single-Layer Contraction:</B> The icosahedron, in order
to contract, must be
a single-layer affair. You could not have two adjacent
layers of vector equilibria and then
have them collapse to become the icosahedron. But take
any single layer of a vector
equilibrium with nothing inside it to push it outward,
and it will collapse into becoming the
icosahedron. If there are two layers, one inside the
other, they will not roll on each other
when the radius contracts. The gears block each other.
So you can only have this
contraction in a single layer of the vector equilibrium,
and it has to be an outside layer
remote from other layers.

 The single-shell behavior of the icosahedron and its
volume ratio of 18.63
arouses suspicions about its relation to the electron.
We appear to have the electron kind
of shells operating in the nucleus-free icosahedron
and are therefore not frustrated from
contracting in that condition.

 The 12 vertexes in their "in-phase" state in the vector

the 12 points of possible tangency of
any one sphere of a closest-packed aggregate with another

to cross over into the next spheres of
closest packing, thus to travel their distance from

icosahedron are the only ones not to go through the

closest-packed unit radius spheres, ergo energy shunted

 The icosahedron could not occur with a nucleus. The

can only occur as a single shell of 12 vertexes remote
from the vector equilibrium's multi-
unlimited-frequency, concentric-layer growth. Though
it has the 25 great circles, the
icosahedron no longer represents the travel of energy
from any sphere to any tangent
sphere, but it provides the most economical route between
a chain of tangent icosahedra
and a face-bonded icosahedral structuring of a "giant

well as for energies locked up on its surface to continue
to make orbits of their own in
local travel around that single sphere's surface.

 This unique behavior may relate to the fact that the
volume of the
icosahedron in respect to the vector equilibrium with
the rational value of 20 is 18.51 and
to the fact that the mass of the electron is approximately
one over 18.51 in respect to the
mass of the neutron. The icosahedron's shunting of energy
into local spherical orbiting,
disconnecting it from the closest-packed railroad tracks
of energy travel from sphere to
sphere, tends to identify the icosahedron very uniquely
with the electron's unique behavior
in respect to nuclei as operating in remote orbit shells.

 The energy charge of the electron is easy to discharge
from the surfaces of
systems. Our 25 great circles could lock up a whole
lot of energy to be discharged. The
spark could jump over at this point. We recall the name
<I>electron</I> coming from the Greeks
rubbing of amber, which then discharged sparks. If we
assume that the vertexes are points
of discharge, then we see how the six great circles
of the icosahedron<SUP>&#95;&#95;</SUP>which never get
near its own vertexes<SUP>&#95;&#95;</SUP>may represent the way the residual
charge will always remain bold
on the surface of the-icosahedron.

 Maybe the 31 great circles of the icosahedron lock
up the energy charges of
the electron, while the six great circles release the
sparks.

 <B>Icosahedron as Local Shunting Circuit:</B> The icosahedron

 The icosahedron's function in Universe may be to throw
the switch of
cosmic energy into a local shunting circuit. In the
icosahedron energy gets itself locked up
even more by the six great circles<SUP>&#95;&#95;</SUP>which may explain
why electrons are borrowable and
independent of the proton-neutron group.

 The great circles of the icosahedron can be folded
out of circular discs of
paper by three different methods: (a) 15 multi-bow ties
of four tetrahedra each; (b) six
pentagonal bow ties; and (c) 10 multi-bow ties. Each
method defines certain of the surface
arcs and central angles of the icosahedron's great circle
system, but all three methods
taken together do not define all of the surface arcs
and central angles of the icosahedron's
three sets of axis of spin.

 The 15 great circles of the icosahedron can be folded
into multibow ties of
four tetrahedra each. Four times 15 equals 60, which
is half the number of triangles on the
sphere. Sixty additional triangles inadvertently appear,
revealing the 120 identical spherical
triangles which are the maximum number of like units
which may be used to subdivide the
sphere.
