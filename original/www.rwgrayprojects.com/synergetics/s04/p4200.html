 In closest packing of spheres, there are always between
the spheres alternate
spaces that are not being used, and so triangular space
and space-available groups can be
alternated from their original positions 60 degrees
to alternate nestable positions. We find
that you can take two halves of the vector equilibrium
and rotate one of the halves 60
degrees. Instead of having the vector-equilibrium condition
of alternate faces in
symmetrical array around it, you will get a polarized
system around the equatorial zone of
which you will get a square and a square side by side
and a triangle and a triangle side by
side. By rotating the system 60 degrees, you will get
a top polar triangle and a bottom
polar triangle in the same orientation. If you rotate
the vector equilibrium to the next 60-
degree nestable position, suddenly it is omnisymmetrical
again.

 It is in this polarized condition that a section through
the vector equilibrium
makes the famous chemical hex that the chemists have
used for years. The chemists
recognized it as a polarized system, but they did not
recognize it as the vector equilibrium
because chemists had not had any internal atomic experience
like that. Apparently, then,
all the chemical compounding in the organic chemistry
relates to polarized systems.

 In order to reduce the concept of vector equilibrium
to a singlename identity,
we employ the word <I>equanimity</I> as identifying the eternal
metaphysical conceptuality
model that eternally tolerates and accommodates all
the physically regenerative,
intertransforming transactions of eternal, inexorable,
and irreversible evolution's complex
complementations, which are unitarily unthinkable, though
finite.

 The equanimity model permits metaphysically conceptual
thinkability and
permits man to employ the package-word <I>Universe.</I> Equanimity,
the epistemological
model, is the omni-intertransformative, angle- and frequency-modulatable,
differential
accommodator and identifies the direction toward the
absolute, completely exquisite limit
of zero-error, zero-time omnicomprehension toward which
our oscillatory, pulsating
reduction of tolerated cerebrally reflexed aberrations

 Humanity's physical brains' inherent subjective-to-objective
time lag
reflexing induces the relatively aberrated observation
and asymmetrical articulation
tolerated by ever more inclusively and incisively demanding
mind's consciousness of the
absolute exactitude of the eternally referential centrality
at zero of the <I>equanimity model.</I>
Thus mind induces human consciousness of evolutionary
participation to seek cosmic
zero. Cosmic zero is conceptually but sizelessly complex,
though full-size-range

 In the equanimity model, the physical and the metaphysical
share the same
design. The whole of physical Universe experience is
a consequence of our not seeing
instantly, which introduces time. As a result of the
gamut of relative recall time-lags, the
physical is always the imperfect experience, but tantalizingly
always ratio-equated with the
innate eternal sense of perfection.

 As the most compact spherical agglomeration of unit
radius spheres around a
unit radius nuclear sphere, the vector equilibrium is
indefinitely expandable, either by
additional unit radius spheres, colonied, layerembracement
multiplication, or by uniform
time-size increase. If expanded by unit radius, sphere-colonized,
omni-embracing,
concentric layer multiplication, additional new locally
operative nuclei are progressively
born with every four successive concentric generations
of symmetrical, omni-embracing
layer multiplication. We use here the concept of multiplication
only by division of the
conceptual sizeless whole in a greater number of coordinate
parts.

 The relative size of the vector equilibrium begins
with the initial zerosize
integrity of conceptuality and its omnidimensional modular
subdivisibility for accounting
any frequency of geometrical configuration transformative
accounting. Vector equilibria,
as with the tetrahedra and other polyhedra, are conceptually
valid as vector equilibria or
tetrahedra, independent of size. Size is where relativity
becomes generated. The eternality
of synergetics is the experienceable conceptuality whose
imaginability is independent of
individual human life's successive special-case experiences
of time and size relativity.

 Frequency inherently involves a plurality of events,
which means that
frequency begins with two or more event experiences.
Where frequency is one, it means
frequency is none=N-one=frequency-is-not-one, because
frequency is two-or-more. (None
is Latin for number nine, which is also numerologically
a zero.) A frequency of one in the
vector equilibrium is like the vector equilibrium itself,
a <I>zero sate,</I> i.e., energetically
inactive. Frequency of experience inherently involves
<I>intervals</I> between experience.
Intervals that are nonexperiences are not <I>nothingness:</I>
they are number integrities like zero
state. This zero-state integrity is brought home to
human cognition by numerological
arithmetic disclosure
(see <A HREF="../s12/p0000.html#1200.00">Chapter 12</A>,
Numerology) that
every nine experiences in
arithmetical system integrity (integer) accounting always
has a zero operational effect in all
intersystem multiplying or dividing calculations, and
that nature's number coordination
coincides with its geometrical operational evolution,
having only octave periodicity in
which four positive entities accrue followed by the
accrual of four negative entities and an
interval zero state nine, which positive-negative accrual
and intervalling accommodates
rationally ar.d elegantly both the wavilinear and discontinuity
characteristics of all-
experimentally acquired information to date regarding
the electromagnetics and chemistry
of both physical and metaphysical Universe. (See Sec.

 At eternal "outset," the vector equilibrium's frequency
is none<SUP>&#95;&#95;</SUP> non, which
is inactive, which is different in meaning from nonexistent.
Zero is the inside-out phase of
conceptual integrity; it is the eternal complementation
of system. Quite the contrary to
"nonexistent," it means only "eternally existent" in
contrast to "temporarily existent."
Experience is all temporary. Between experiences is
the forever eternal metaphysical,
which cannot be converted into existent. Zerophase,
i.e., the absolute integrity, is a
metaphysical potential in pure principle but is inherently
inactive. The inactivity of
zerophase can be converted into activity only by pure
principle of energetic geometrical
propagation of successive positive-negative-positive-negative
aberrational pulsations
which intertransform locally initiated Universe through
vector-equilibrium complex
frequency accommodations in pure principle. The propagative
pulsations are unopposed
by the inherent but eternal, limitless, unoccupied outwardness
of absolute metaphysical
integrity. The unlimited metaphysical conceptual equilibrium
integrity permits the limited
special-case realizations. The limited cannot accommodate
the unlimited. The unlimited
metaphysical can and does accommodate the limited and
principles-dependent physical;
but the physical, which is always experienceable and
special-case, cannot accommodate
the metaphysical independence and unlimited capability.

 Generalized omni-intertransformable modelability now
faithfully permits
popular human comprehension of all experimentally derived
scientific knowledge
regarding physical phenomena heretofore translated only
into exclusively abstract
mathematical schemes of notationally formalized and
formulated treatment, study,
discovery; objective physical application now becomes
modelable with energy-vectored
tetrahedroning. This means that onniconceptuality of
the geometrical intertransformations
of eternally selfregenerative Universe now returns to
science. This also means that the
omnirational quantation we are discovering here means
that children can conceptualize
nuclear geometry even in their kindergarten years. This
means in turn that nuclear physics
will become lucidly explorable by humanity in its elementary
spontaneously conceptioning
and reasoning years.
