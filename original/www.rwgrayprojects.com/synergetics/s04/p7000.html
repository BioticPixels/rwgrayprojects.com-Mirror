 In the closest packing of spheres, there are only
two symmetric shapes
occurring in the spaces between the spheres. They are
what we call the concave
octahedron and the concave vector equilibrium. One is
an open condition of the vector
equilibrium and the other is a contracted one of the
octahedron. If we take vector
equilibria and compact them, we find that the triangular
faces are occupying a position in
closest packing of a space and that the square faces
are occupying the position in closest
packing of a sphere. (For a further exposition of the
interchange between spheres and
spaces, see illustrations at
Sec. <A HREF="../s10/p2000.html#1032.00">1032</A>, "Convex and
Concave Sphere Packing Voids.")

 When we compact vector equilibria with one another,
we find that two of
their square faces match together. Within a square face,
we have a half octahedron; so
bringing two square faces together produces an internal
octahedron between the two of
them. At the same time, a set of external octahedra
occurs between the triangular faces of
the adjacent vector equilibria.

 The initial self-and-other spherical associability
(see Sec. <A HREF="p0100.html#401.00">401</A> and illustration
<A HREF="p0100.html#401.00">401</A> produced first, associability; next, triangulation
as structure; and then, tetrahedron
as system. The inherent self-stretch-apartness reaction
identified as mass attraction, and
the inherent otherness of awareness, and the discovery
of the self through the otherness, as
a consequence of which awareness of relatedness, and
curiosity about the interrelatedness
of further unprecedented self-and-otherness discoveries,
all initiate the tetrahedron's self-
discovering that it can turn itself inside out by employing
the masscoherent integrity of any
three spheres's intergeared frictionality to swallow
involutingly the fourth sphere through
the three's central passage and to extrude it evolutingly
outward again on the other side.

 Thus tetrahedron discovers that each of its four vertexes
can be plunge-
passaged through its innards to be extended on the opposite
side of its four triangular
faces. This automatically develops eight tetrahedral,
self-transformation awarenesses and
produces eight common nuclear-vertex tetrahedra of the
vector equilibrium.

 Further self-examination of the tetrahedron discovrs
that the geometry of its
insideness proves to be a concave octahedron, with four
of the octahedron's triangular
faces represented by the four triangular windows at
the face centers of the tetrahedron and
the other triangular faces hidden from the view of outsiders,
but clearly viewable from
inside the tetrahedron's system as the spherical triangular
areas of the interior surfaces of
the tetrahedron's four corner balls; the edges of the
triangles are defined as the great circle
arcs leading most economically between each ball's three
interior tangent contact points
with each of the other three balls, respectively.

 And now we have the octahedron self-examinatingly
discovered and more
sharply defined by the 12 chords of the great-circle
arcs being realized as shorter distances
than arcs, as lines of sight, between their six common
vertexes. Thereafter, awareness of
the fourfold equatorial square symmetry of four of those
octahedral, equidistanted six
vertexes of the octahedron, and discovery of the three
XYZ axes crossing one another at
the octahedron's center within the shortest distance
centrally apart from the three sets of
opposite vertexes or poles, thus establishing the one-quarter
full circle as well as the one-
sixth full circle angular self-fractionating as the
octa-andtetra interpump through the
phases of the icosa into full extension of the vector
equilibrium: "equanimity" of all
potential systems and the extreme local domain of its
local self-realization.

 Thereafter, self-recognition of its six half-octahedra
aspects of its own six
polar potentials, and thence the self-discovery of its
integral four great-circle symmetry,
and its vector equanimity of effectively opposed disintegrative
propensities by its mass-
attractive, full-circle closingness at highleverage
advantage of radius of lever arm self-
wrapping around itself, as being more powerfully effective
than its self-disintegratively
employed equipotential disintegrativeness; whereby the
ever self-multiplications at the
second-power arithmetical rate of its associative propensities
are realized by their
initiation, in contradistinction to the immediate second-root
rate of diminution of the
energy potential whenever it even starts to disintegrate.

 Thus the self-discovery of the tetrahedral structural
system and subsequent
evolutionary realization of its inherent octahedral
symmetry goes on further to discover its
tetrahedron-octahedron complementarity of allspacefilling,
and its development thereby of
the universal isotropic vector matrix as a self-referring
frame comprehensive of its relative
aberrations of realizable exactitude which only approaches
its ideal equanimity.

 Whereafter the self-discovery process goes on to identify
all the hierarchy of
geometrical intertransformings that are the subject
of this book, and proceeds inherently,
by synergetic strategy of commencing with totality of
Universe self-realization, to its
progressive omnirational differentiation of its ever
symmetrically equated potentials. And
all other geometrical proofs of the Greeks and their
academic successors aboard our self-
realizing planet are herewith usably embraced; and all
the rules of geometrical self-
development proofs in terms of a priori self-realization
proofs are discovered to be
germane but always holistically embraced in omnirational
identity. Self is not a priori
evident. Thus we have avoided mathematical axioms that
hold certain recognized a priori
self-recognized conditions to be self-evidently irreducible
by further analysis.

 Instead of starting with parts<SUP>&#95;&#95;</SUP>points, straight lines,
and planes and then
attempting to develop these inadequately definable parts
into omnidirectional experience
identities, we start with the whole system in which
the initial "point" turned out to be self,
which inherently embraced all of its parameters wrapped
tightly in that initial
underdeveloped, self-focused aspect of self and went
on to self-develop through
successively discovered relative awarenesses whereby
the proof of totality and omni-
integrity is not only always inherent, but all the rules
of operational procedure are always
totally observed.
