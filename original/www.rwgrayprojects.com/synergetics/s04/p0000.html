 A system is the first subdivision of Universe. It divides
all the Universe into
six parts: first, all the universal events occurring
geometrically outside the system; second,
all the universal events occurring geometrically inside
the system; third, all the universal
events occurring nonsimultaneously, remotely, and unrelatedly
prior to the system events;
fourth, the Universe events occurring nonsimultaneously,
remotely, and unrelatedly
subsequent to the system events; fifth, all the geometrically
arrayed set of events
constituting the system itself; and sixth, all the Universe
events occurring synchronously
and or coincidentally to and with the systematic set
of events uniquely considered.

 A system is the first subdivision of Universe into
a conceivable entity
separating all that is nonsimultaneously and geometrically
outside the system, ergo
irrelevant, from all that is nonsimultaneously and geometrically
inside and irrelevant to the
system; it is the remainder of Universe that conceptually
constitutes the system's set of
conceptually tunable and geometrical interrelatability
of events.

human's sensing within the electromagnetic spectrum
and wherein the geometrical
relationships are imaginatively conceivable by humans

 All systems are polyhedra. Systems having insideness
and outsideness must
return upon themselves in a plurality of directions
and are therefore interiorally concave
and exteriorally convex. Because concaveness reflectively
concentrates radiation
impinging upon it and convexity diffuses radiation impinging
upon it, concavity and
convexity are fundamentally different, and therefore
every system has an always and only
coexisting inward and outward functionally differentialed
complementarity. Any one
system has only one insideness and only one outsideness.

 In addition to possessing inherent insideness and
outsideness, a system is
inherently concave and convex, complex, and finite.
A system may be either symmetrical
or asymmetrical. A system may consist of a plurality
of subsystems. Oneness, twoness, and
threeness cannot constitute a system, as they inherently
lack insideness and outsideness.
Twoness constitutes wavilinear relatedness. Threeness
constitutes planar relatedness,
which is inherently triangular. Three triangular planes
alone cannot differentiate,
distinguish, or constitute a system. At minimum, it
takes four triangular planes having
inherent fourness of vertexes to constitute differential
withinness and withoutness.
Fourness of geometrically contiguous and synchronous
event foci and their coincidentally
defined four triangular planes, along with their six
common edges provided by the six
wavilinear vectors connecting the four event foci, altogether
inherently differentiate,
distinguish, initially institute, and constitute prime
or minimum withinness and
withoutness.

 Thought is systemic. Cerebration and intellection

 Human thoughts are always conceptually and definitively
confined to system
considerability and comprehension. The whole Universe
may not be conceptually
considered by thought because thinkability is limited
to contiguous and contemporary
integrity of conformation of consideration, and Universe
consists of a vast inventory of
nonsynchronous, noncontiguous, noncontemporary, noncoexisting,
irreversibly
transforming, dissimilar events.

As minimum or prime systems consist of four event foci
and their always and only
coexisting fourness of triangularly defined planar facets,
along with their sixness of a
wavilinearly defined minimum set of unique componentation
relatedness, unity is
inherently plural. Unity is plural. A system is a local
phenomenon in the Universe. Each of
the conceivable or imaginable awareness or thinkability
entities or phenomena inducing or
producing onenesses or twonesses are subvisible and
potentially further subdivisible, or as
yet unresolved, ergo unrecognized systems. Functions
always and only cooccur as
subsystem relativistics, characteristics, inherencies,
and proclivities. Functions occur only
as parts of systems. Universe is constituted of a complex
plurality of nonsimultaneous and
only partially overlappingly occurring systems, not
one system.

 All the interrelationships of system foci are conceptually
representable by
vectors
(see Sec. <A HREF="../s05/p1900.html#521.00">521</A>).
A system is a closed configuration
of vectors. It is a pattern of
forces constituting a geometrical integrity that returns
upon itself in a plurality of
directions. Polyhedral systems display a plurality of
polygonal perimeters, all of which
eventually return upon themselves. Systems have an electable
plurality of view-induced
polarities. The polygons of polyhedra peregrinate systematically
and sometimes
wavilinearly around three or more noncongruent axes.

 Absolutely straight lines or absolutely flat planes
would, theoretically,
continue onwardly or spread areally outward to infinity.
The difference between infinity
and finity is governed by the taking out of angular
sinuses, like pieces of pie cut out of
surface areas around a point in an otherwise absolute
and infinitely extendable plane, and
joining together the open gap's radial edges. This is
the way lampshades and skirts are
made. Joining the sinused fan-edges together makes a
cone. If two cones are made and
their respective open circle edges are brought together,
a finite or closed system results. It
has two poles and two polar domains. The two poles and
their polar cone surface
domains, as well as the defined insideness and outsideness,
are inherent and primary
characteristics of all systems.

 Maximum system complexity consists of a dissimilarly
quantified inventory
of unique and nonintersubstitutable components. That
is, Euler's irreducible-system
aspects of <I>vertexes, areas,</I> and <I>edges</I> exhibit the respective
dissimilar quantities <I>4, 4,</I> and <I>6</I>
in the minimum prime system, the tetrahedron. This demonstrates
the inherent synergy of
all systems, since their minimum overall inventory of
inherent characteristics is unpredicted
and unpredictable by any of the parts taken separately.
Systems are unpredicted by
oneness, twoness, or threeness. This explains how it
happens that general systems theory
is a new branch of science.

 General systems theory is another example of evolution
by inadvertence. It
developed fortuitously to accommodate the unprecedented
and vastly complex
undertakings of the late twentieth century, such as
the 10 million separate and only
partially overlapping "critical path" tasks that had
to be accomplished and tested to
foolproof reliability en route to countdown to eventual
blastoff, Moon landing, and safe
return to Earth, which found all conventional mathematical
theory wanting. It required the
development of the computer and star-focused instruments
and computer programming
arts together with operational research, which guess-improvises
the inventory of
parameter of variables that must be progressively programmed
into the system in order
further to reduce the magnitude of tolerated errors
consequent to trial "bird" (rocket
vehicle) "flight" (trajectory) control as the vehicles
are progressively zeroed-in to
progressive target rendezvous with celestial entities.
Neither differential and integral
calculus, nor "probability" statistics, nor any branch
of specialized hard science has
accredited synergy as an a priori assumption. General
systems theory, which recognizes
synergy as inherent, was discovered and named by the
biologically inspired Ludwig von
Bertalanffy.

 Every system, as a subdivision of the total experience
of Universe, must
accommodate traffic of inbound and outbound events and
inward-outward relationships
with other systems' aspects of Universe. Effective thinking
is systematic because
intellectual comprehension occurs only when the interpatternings
of experience events'
star foci interrelationships return upon themselves.
Then the case history becomes
"closed." A system is a patterning of enclosure consisting
of a conceptual aggregate of
recalled experience items, or events, having inherent
insideness, outsideness, and
omniaroundness.

 <B>Tiger's Skin:</B> Typical of all finitely conceptual objects,
or systems, the
tiger's skin can be locally pierced and thence slotted
open. Thereafter, by elongating the
slot and initiating new subslots therefrom in various
directions, the skin gradually can be
peeled open and removed all in one piece. Adequate opening
of the slots into angular
sinuses will permit the skin to lie out progressively
flat. Thus, the original lunar gash from
the first puncture develops into many subgashes leading
from the original gash into any
remaining domical areas of the skin. The slitting of
a paper cone from its circular edge to
its apex allows the paper to be laid out as a flat "fan"

 The minimum single symmetrical system is the regular
tetrahedron, which
contains the least volume with the most surface as compared
to all other symmetrical
single systems. There are only three single symmetrical
systems: the regular tetrahedron,
with a "unit" volume-to-skin ratio of 1 to l; the regular
octahedron, with a volume-to-
surface ratio of 2 to 1; and the regular icosahedron,
with a volume-to-surface ratio of 3.7
to 1. Single asymmetrical systems contain less volume
per surface area of containment
than do symmetrical or regular tetrahedra. The more
asymmetrical, the less the volume-to-
surface ratio. Since the structural strength is expressed
by the vector edges, the more
asymmetrical, the greater is the containment strength
per unit of volumetric content.

 Since the minimum system consists of two types of
tetrahedra, one
symmetrical (or regular) and the other asymmetrical
(or irregular); and since also the
asymmetrical have greater enveloping strength per units
of contained event phenomena,
we will differentiate the two minimum-system types by
speaking of the simplest, or
minimum, single symmetrical system as the <I>mini-symmetric</I>
system; and we will refer to
the minimum asymmetric system as the <I>mini-asymmetric</I>
system. And since the mini-
symmetric system is the regular tetrahedron, which cannot
be compounded face-to-face
with other unit-edged symmetric tetrahedra to fill allspace,
but, in order to fill allspace,
must be compounded with the tetrahedron's complementary
symmetrical system, the
octahedron, which is not a minimum system and has twice
the volume-to-surface ratio of
the tetrahedron of equal edge vector dimension; and
since, on the other hand, two special-
case minimum asymmetric tetrahedra, the A Quanta Modules
and the B Quanta Modules
(see Sec. <A HREF="../s09/p2000.html#920.00">920.00</A>),
have equal volume and may be face-compounded
with one another to fill
allspace, and are uniquely the highest common volumetric
multiple of allspace-filling; and
since the single asymmetrical tetrahedron formed by
compounding two symmetrical
tetrahedral A Modules and one asymmetrical tetrahedral
B Module will compound with
multiples of itself to fill all positive space, and
may be turned inside out to form its
noncongruent negative complement (which may also be
compounded with multiples of
itself to fill all negative space), this three-module,
minimum asymmetric (irregular)
tetrahedral system, which accommodates both positive
or negative space and whose
volume is exactly 1/8 that of the regular tetrahedron;
and exactly 1/32 the volume of the
regular octahedron; and exactly 1/160 the volume of
the regular vector equilibrium of zero
frequency; and exactly 1/1280 the volume of the vector
equilibrium of the initial of all
frequencies, the integer 2, which is to say that, expressed

 Since the two-A-Module, one-B-Module minimum asymmetric
system
tetrahedron constitutes the generalized nuclear geometrical
limit of rational differentiation,
it is most suitably to be identified as the prime minimum
rational structural system: also
known as the MITE (see "Modelability,"
Sec. <A HREF="../s09/p4300.html#950.00">950.00</A>). The
MITE is the mathematically
demonstrable microlimit of rational fractionation of
both physically energetic structuring
and metaphysical structuring as a single, universal,
geometrically discrete system-constant
of quantation. The MITE consists of two A Modules and
one B Module, which are
mathematically demonstrable as the minimum cosmic volume
constant, but not the
geometrical shape constant. The shape differentiability
renders the volume-to-surface ratio
of the B Modules more envelopingly powerful than the
volume-to-surface ratio of the A
Modules; ergo, the most powerful local-energy-impounding,
omnirationally quantatable,
microcosmic structural system.

 <B>Interconnection of Systems:</B> If two adjacent systems
become joined by one
vertex, they still constitute two systems, but universally
interjointed. If two adjacent
systems are interconnected by two vertexes, they remain
two systems, interlocked by a
hinge. If two adjacent systems become adjoined by three
vertexes, they become one
complex system because they have acquired unit insideness

 Systems are, in effect, spherical gears. Their internal-external
pulsating and
rotating "teeth" consist in reality of both circumferential
and radial waves of various
frequencies of subdivision of spherical unity. They
often fail to mesh with other local
systems. Some of them mesh only in special aspects.
The universally frequent nonmeshing
of geometrical sizes and rates of wavelengths and frequencies
produces an omnicondition
in which the new system's center, as each is created,
must continually occupy an
omnidirectionally greater domain.
