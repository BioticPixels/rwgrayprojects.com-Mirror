<TR><TD>Fig. 401.00 Tensegrity Tetrahedron with "Me" Ball Suspended at Center
of Volume of the Tetrahedron:  Note that the six solid compression members
are the acceleration vectors trying to escape from Universe at either end,
by action and reaction; whereas the ends of each would-be escapee are
restrained by three tensors, one long and two short; while the ball at the
center is restrained from local torque and twist by three triangulated
tensors tangentially affixed from each of the four corners.
