<TR><TD>Fig. 457.40 Definition of Spherical Polyhedra in 31-Great-Circle
Icosahedron System: The 31 great circles
of the spherical icosahedron provide spherical edges
for three other polyhedra in addition to the
icosahedron itself, whose edges are shown as heavy lines.
The shading indicates a typical face, as follows:
<OL TYPE="A">
<LI>The rhombic triacontahedron with 30 spherical rhombic
faces, each consisting of four basic, least-
common-denominator triangles.
<LI>The octahedron with 15 basic, least-common-denominator
spherical triangles.
<LI>The pentagonal dodecahedron with ten basic, least-common-denominator
spherical triangles.
<LI>Skewed spherical vector equilibrium.
</OL>
