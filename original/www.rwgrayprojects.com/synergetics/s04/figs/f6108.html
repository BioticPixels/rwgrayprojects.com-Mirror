<TR><TD>Fig. 461.08 Jitterbug System Collapses into Tetrahedron:
Polarization: The "jitterbug" system, after
reaching the octahedron phase, may be collapsed and
folded into the regular tetrahedron. Notice that
because the vector equilibrium has 24 edges the tetrahedra
have accumulated four edges at each of their
six normal edges. The "jitterbug" can also be folded
into a larger but incomplete tetrahedron. Note
that in this case the two sets of double edges suggest
polarization.
