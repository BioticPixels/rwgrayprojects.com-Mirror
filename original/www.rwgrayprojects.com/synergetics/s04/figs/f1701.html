<TR><TD>Fig. 417.01 Precession of Two Sets of 60 Closest-Packed
Spheres as Seven-Frequency Tetrahedron: Two
identical sets of 60 spheres in closest packing precess
in 90-degree action to form a seven-frequency,
eight-ball-edged tetrahedron with a total of 120 spheres,
of which exactly 100 spheres are on the surface
of the tetrahedron and 20 are inside but have no geometrical
space accommodation for an equiradius
nuclear sphere. The 120-sphere, nonnucleated tetrahedron
is the largest possible double-shelled
tetrahedral aggregation of closest-packed spheres having
no nuclear sphere.
