<TR><TD>Fig. 465.00 Note that the eight triangular faces of
the vector equilibrium are disposed about four-sided
openings, i.e. square faces. It is possible to arrange
20 triangles in similar fashion around five-sided
openings, i.e. pentagons. The shape is the icosadodecahedron.
When a model is constructed with 20
spokes, i.e. ten axes, meeting at its center, which
pass through the centers of each triangle, an
unexpected behavior results. In the vector equilibrium
model the triangles will rotate and contract
towards tits center, however, with the icosadodecahedron
the entire structure remains fixed. It is not
capable of contraction due to the fact that there is
an odd number of triangles surrounding each
opening. The diagrams show clearly why this is so. Any
odd-numbered array of interlocked gears will
not be free to rotate.
