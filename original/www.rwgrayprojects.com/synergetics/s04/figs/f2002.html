<TR><TD>Fig. 420.02 When the centers of equiradius spheres in
closest packing are joined with lines, an isotropic
vector matrix is formed. This constitutes an array of
equilateral triangles which is seen as the
comprehensive coordination frame of reference of nature's
most economical, most comfortable structural
interrelationships employing 60-degree association and
disassociation. This provides an omnirational
accounting system which, if arbitrarily accounted on
a 90-degree basis, becomes inherently irrational.
The isotropic vector matrix demonstrates the capability
of accommodating all symmetrically and
asymmetrically terminaled, high-frequency energy vectors
of any structural shaping.
