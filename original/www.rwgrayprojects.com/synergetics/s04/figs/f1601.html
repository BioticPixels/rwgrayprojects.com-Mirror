<TR><TD>Fig. 416.01 <I>Tetrahedral Precession of Closest Packed
Spheres:</I>
<OL TYPE="A">
<LI>Two pairs of seven-ball, triangular sets of closest
packed spheres precess in 60 degree twist to
associate as the cube. This 14-sphere cube is the minimum
structural cube which may be produced
by closest-packed spheres. Eight spheres will not close-pack
as a cube and are utterly unstable.
<LI>When two sets of two tangent balls are self-interprecessed
into closest packing, a half-circle inter-
rotation effect occurs. The resulting figure is the
tetrahedron.
<LI>The two-frequency (three-sphere-to-an-edge) square-centered
tetrahedron may also be formed
through one-quarter-circle precessional action.
