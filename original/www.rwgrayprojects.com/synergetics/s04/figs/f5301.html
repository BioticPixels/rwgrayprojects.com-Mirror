<TR><TD>Fig. 453.01 Great Circles of Vector Equilibrium Define
Lowest Common Multiple Triangle: 1/48th of a
Sphere: The shaded triangle is 1/48th of the entire
sphere and is the lowest common denominator (in 24
rights and 24 lefts) of the total spherical surface.
The 48 LCD triangles defined by the 25 great circles
of
the vector equilibrium are grouped together in whole
increments to define exactly the spherical surface
areas, edges, and vertexes of the spherical tetrahedron,
spherical cube, spherical octahedron, and
spherical rhombic dodecahedron. The heavy lines are
the edges of the four great circles of the vector
equilibrium. Included here is the spherical trigonometry
data for this lowest-common-denominator
triangle of 25-great-circle hierarchy of the vector
equilibrium.
