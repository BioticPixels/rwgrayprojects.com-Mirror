<TR><TD>Fig. 466.01 Reciprocal Motion of Nine Internal Spheres
Propagates Wave by Diagonal Elongation: (The
original version of this drawing was copyrighted by
R. Buckminster Fuller in 1944.) This is a planar
representation of the closest-packed spheres in the
outer layer as they skew-transform between the
icosahedral and the vector equilibrium phases.
<OL TYPE="A">
<LI>Apex sphere K surrounded by two 16-ball grids M and
N, and by short-axis diamond E and long-axis
diamond D.
<LI>The 90-degree alignment of the 16 balls of any one
of the six square faces of the vector equilibrium.
<LI>Plan view of the closest-packing aspects of any one
of the vector equilibrium's four pairs of nuclear
tetrahedra as they begin to torque in the jitterbug
process.
<LI>Short-axis diamond.
<LI>Long-axis diamond.
