<TR><TD>Fig. 413.01 Vector Equilibrium: Omnidirectional Closest
Packing Around a Nucleus: Triangles can be
subdivided into greater and greater numbers of similar
units. The number of modular subdivisions along
any edge can be referred to as the frequency of a given
triangle. In triangular grid each vertex may be
expanded to become a circle or sphere showing the inherent
relationship between closest packed spheres
and triangulation. The frequency of triangular arrays
of spheres in the plane is determined by counting
the number of intervals (A) rather than the number of
spheres on a given edge. In the case of concentric
packings or spheres around a nucleus the frequency of
a given system can either be the edge subdivision
or the number of concentric shells or layers. Concentric
packings in the plane give rise to hexagonal
arrays (B) and omnidirectional closest packing of equal
spheres around a nucleus (C) gives rise to the
vector equilibrium (D).
