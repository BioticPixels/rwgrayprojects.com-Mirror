<TR><TD>Fig. 465.10 The vector equilibrium with wheels showing
that when one wheel is immobilized (the lower
wheel in photos) and the system is rotated about the
axis shared by the fixed wheel and its opposite
wheel, the opposite wheel remains stationary but the
other six wheels rotate in concert. The polarity of
the system is thus demonstrated.
