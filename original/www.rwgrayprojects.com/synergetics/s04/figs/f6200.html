<TR><TD>Fig. 462.00 The triangle formed by connecting diagonals
of three adjacent faces of the cube is the face
of the tetrahedron within the cube. If the triangle
is rotated so that its vertexes move along the edges
of
the cube, its position changes from the positive to
the negative tetrahedron. Two equal tetrahedra
(positive and negative) joined at their common centers
define the cube. The total available energy of a
system is related to its surface area, involving the
second power (square) of the radius. E=Mc<SUP>2</SUP>: The
conjunction of any two similar systems results in a
synergetic relationship: the second power of
individual totals of cohesiveness of the systems.
