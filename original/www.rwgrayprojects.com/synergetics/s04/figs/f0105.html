<TR><TD>Fig. 401.05 The six compression members are the acceleration
vectors trying to escape from Universe at
either end by action and reaction, while the ends of
each would-be escapee are restrained by three tensors;
while the ball at the center is restrained from local
torque and twist by three triangulated tensors from
each of the four corners tangentially affixed.
