<TR><TD>Fig. 470.02C Transformation of Vector Equilibrium and
Octahedron as Space-Filling Jitterbug:
Because the vector equilibrium and the octahedron will
fill space, it is possible to envision a space-
filling "jitterbug" transformation. If we combine vector
equilibrium on their square faces in a space-
filling "jitterbug" arrangement, the triangular faces
form octahedral voids (1). As the vector equilibria
contract, just as in the single "jitterbug," they transform
through the icosahedron phase (3) and end at
the octahedron phase (5).
