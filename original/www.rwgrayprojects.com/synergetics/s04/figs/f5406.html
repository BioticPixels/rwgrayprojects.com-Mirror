<TR><TD>Fig. 454.06 Definition of Spherical Polyhedra in 25-Great-Circle
Vector Equilibrium System: The 25
great circles of the spherical vector equilibrium provide
all the spherical edges for four spherical
polyhedra in addition to the vector equilibrium whose
edges are shown here as heavy lines. The
shading indicates a typical face of each as follows:
<OL TYPE="A">
<LI>The edges of one of the spherical tetrahedron's four
spherical triangles consists of 12 VE basic
LCD triangles.
<LI>The edges of one of the spherical octahedron's eight
spherical triangles consists of six VE basic
LCD triangles.
<LI>The edges of one of the spherical cube's six spherical
squares consists of eight VE basic LCD
triangles.
<LI>The edges of one of the spherical rhombic dodecahedron's
12 spherical rhombic faces consists of
four VE basic LCD triangles.
<LI>The edges of one of the spherical octahedron's eight
spherical triangles consists of a total area
equal to six VE basic LCD triangles.
