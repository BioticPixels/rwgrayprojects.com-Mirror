<TR><TD>Fig. 458.12 Folding of Great Circles into the Icosahedron
System:
<OL TYPE="A">
<LI> The 15 great circles of the icosahedron folded into
"multi-bow-ties" consisting of four tetrahedrons
each. Four times 15 equals 60, which is 1/2 the number
of triangles on the sphere. Sixty
additional triangles inadvertently appear, revealing
the 120 identical (although right- and left-
handed) spherical triangles, which are the maximum number
of like units that may be used to
subdivide the sphere.
<LI>The six great-circle icosahedron system created from
six pentagonal "bow-ties."
