<TR><TD>Fig. 465.01 Four Axes of Vector Equilibrium with Rotating
Wheels or Triangular Cams:
<OL TYPE="A">
<LI> The four axes of the vector equilibrium suggesting
a four-dimensional system. In the contraction of
the "jitterbug" from vector equilibrium to the octahedron,
the triangles rotate about these axes.
<LI> Each triangle rotates in its own cube.
<LI> The four axes of the vector equilibrium shown with
wheels replacing the triangular faces. The wheels
are tangent to one another at the vertexes of the triangles,
and when one wheel is turned, the others
also rotate. If one wheel is immobilized and the system
is rotated on the axes of this wheel, the
opposite wheel remains stationary, demonstrating the
polarity of the system.
<LI> Each wheel can be visualized as rotating inwardly
on itself thereby causing all other wheels to
rotate in a similar fashion.
<LI> If each wheel is conceived as a triangular cam shape,
when they are rotated a continuous "pumping"
or reciprocating action is introduced.
