<TR><TD>Fig. 455.11 Folding of Great Circles into Spherical
Cube or Rhombic Dodecahedron and Vector
Equilibrium: Bow-Tie Units:
<OL TYPE="A">
<LI> This six-great-circle construction defines the positive-negative
spherical tetrahedrons within the
cube. This also reveals a spherical rhombic dodecahedron.
The circles are folded into "bow-tie"
units as shown. The shaded rectangles in the upper left
indicates the typical plane represented by the
six great circles.
<LI>The vector equilibrium is formed by four great circle
folded into "bow-ties." The sum of the areas of
the four great circles equals the surface area of the
sphere. (4<IMG SRC="../../figs/pi.gif"> r<SUP>2</SUP>).
