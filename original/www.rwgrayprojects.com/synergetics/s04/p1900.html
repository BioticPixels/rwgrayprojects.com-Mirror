 Those subsequently isolated chemical elements beyond
the 92 prime self-
regenerative chemical elements constitute super-atomics.
They are the non-self-
regenerative chemical elements of negative Universe.

 Negative Universe is the complementary but invisible
Universe. To
demonstrate negative Universe, we take one rubber glove
with an external green surface
and an internal red surace. On the green surface a series
of 92 numbers is patterned; and
on the red surface a continuance of 93, 94, through
to 184, with number 184 at the inside
end of the pinky<SUP>&#95;&#95;</SUP>each of the inner surface numbers being
the inner pole of the outer pole
point number positionings. The positions of the numbers
on the inside correspond to the
positions of the numbers on the outside. The numbering
starts with the position of the five
fingernails, then their successive first joints, and
then their successive second joints from
the tips: 5, 10, 15, and 20 numbers accommodated by
the digits. The other 62 members
are arranged in four rows of 12 each around the back
and front of the palm of the hand.
There is a final row of 14 at the terminal edge of the
glove opening<SUP>&#95;&#95;</SUP>this makes a total of
92. Now we can see why the 92 numbers on the outside
were discoverable in a random
manner requiring very little physical effort. It was
just a matter of which part of your
gloved hand you happened to be looking at. But if we
become curious about what may be
on the inside of the glove we discover that the glove
is powerfully resilient. It takes a great
deal of power to turn it up, to roll back the open edge<SUP>&#95;&#95;</SUP>and
it takes increasing amounts of
power to cope with the increasing thickness of the rubber
that rolls up as the glove opens.
The elements from 93 on are revealed progressively by
the numbers.

 The discovery of the first 92 self-regenerative chemical
elements was not by
the numbers starting with one, but in a completely random
sequence. In the super-atomics,
beyond Uranium, number 92, the split-second-lived chemical
elements have been
discovered in a succession that corresponds to their
atomic number<SUP>&#95;&#95;</SUP>for example, the
94th discovery had the atomic weight of 94; the 100th
discovery was atomic weight 100,
etc.

 This orderly revelation is in fundamental contrast
to the discoveries of the 92
self-regenerative elements and their naturally self-regeneratively
occurring isotopes. The
discovery of the post-uranium elements has involved
the employment of successively
greater magnitudes of energy concentration and focusing.
As each of the super-atomic
trans-uranium elements was isolatingly discovered, it
disintegrated within split seconds.
The orderliness of the succession of the discovery of
super-atomics corresponds to the
rate of increase of the magnitudes of energy necessary
to bring them into split-second
identifiability before they revert to their inside<SUP>&#95;&#95;</SUP>ergo,
invisible to outside<SUP>&#95;&#95;</SUP> position.

 Every layer of a finite system has both an interior,
concave, associability
potential and an exterior, convex, associability potential.
Hence the <I>outer</I> layer of a
vector-equilibrium-patterned atom system always has
an additional full number
"unemployed associability" count. In the example cited
above (Sec. <A HREF="p1600.html#418.03">418.03</A>),
an additional
92 was added to the 146 as the sum of the number of
spheres in the first three shells. The
total is 238, the number of nucleons in uranium, whose
atomic weight is 238. Four of the
nucleons on the surface of one of the square faces of
the vector equilibrium's
closest-packed aggregation of nucleons may be separated
out without impairing the
structural-stability integrity of the balance of the
aggregate. This leaves a residue of 236
nucleons, which is the fissionable state of uranium<SUP>&#95;&#95;</SUP>which
must go on chain-reacting due
to its asymmetry.

 When a new nucleus becomes completely surrounded by

three enclosure levels or more, the initial nucleus

 The omnidirectional closest packing of spheres in
all six symmetrical
conformations of the primitive hierarchy of polyhedra
probably provides models for all the
chemical elements in a hierarchy independent of size
in which the sum of the spheres in all
the layers and the nuclear sphere equals the most prominent
number of neutrons, and the
number in the outer layer alone equals the number of protons
of each atom. In the VE
symmetry of layer growth the sum of the spheres is one
and the outer layer is one: the
initial sphere represents the element hydrogen, with
the atomic number 1, having one
neutron and one proton. The second VE assembly layer,
magnesium, with the atomic
number 12, has 12 protons and 24 neutrons. The third
layer, molybdenum, with the atomic
number 42, has 42 protons and a majority of 54 neutrons.
The fourth layer, uranium, with
the atomic number 92, has 92 protons and an isotopal
majority of 146 neutrons. (Compare

 <B> Closest-sphere-packing Analogy to Atomic Structure:</B>
In 1978 Philip
Blackmarr, a student of synergetics from Pasadena, proposed
a novel analogy of closest-
sphere-packing geometry to electron-proton-neutron interrelationships
and atomic
structure. He took note of the following four facts;
<OL TYPE="1">
<LI>In the closest packing of unit radius spheres each
spheric and interspheric
space domain is equally and symmetrically embraced by
allspace-filling rhombic
dodecahedra.
(Sec. <A HREF="p2300.html#426.20">426.20</A>.)
<LI> The concentrically embracing shells of the vector
equilibrium have a successive
population growth rate of 10F<SUP>2</SUP> + 2, resulting in 12
spheres in the first layer,
in the second, 92 in the third, and 162 in the fourth.
(See Chart <A HREF="p1500.html#415.03">415.03</A>.)
<LI>In the concentric successive shells of closest-packed
spheres a new nucleus
does not appear until the fifth frequency<SUP>&#95;&#95;</SUP> the fifth
shell layer. (Secs. <A HREF="p1200.html#414.00">414</A> and
<A HREF="p1520.html#415.30">415.30</A>)
<LI>The ratio of the electron mass to the proton mass
is 1:1836. (Sec. <A HREF="p2700.html#433.02">433.02</A>.)
</OL>
Bearing those four facts in mind Blackmarr employed
a symmetrical fourshell aggregate of
308 rhombic dodecahedra to represent the total allspacefilling
domains of the 308 spheres
of the maximum limit nuclear domain. He then intuitively
divided the number 1836 by 6,
the latter being the volume of the rhombic dodecahedron
in respect to the volume of the
tetrahedron as one. The number 1836/6= 306 becomes significant
as it represents the total
number of neutron spheric domains in the vector equilibrium
concentric shell packingess
the number two of their integral number to serve as
poles of the axis of spin of the
symmetrical system. The spheres in the successive shell
layers<SUP>&#95;&#95;</SUP> 12, 42, 92, 162<SUP>&#95;&#95;</SUP>add up
to 308; 308 - 2 = 306.

 Blackmarr then hypothetically identified the electron
as the volume of the
unit-vector-edge tetrahedron as ratioed to the volume
of the four-frequency vector
equilibrium, representing a symmetrical and "solid"
agglomeration of 308 rhombic
dodecahedra (with two of the outer-layer rhombic dodecahedra
assigned to serve as the
symmetrically opposite poles of the system's axis of
spin), or of 308 unit-radius spheres
and their interspaces. This evidences that the space
filled by the 308 rhombic dodecahedra
is the maximum, cosmic-limit, unit-vector, symmetrical
polyhedral space occupiable by a
single nucleus.

 Here is an elegant realization that two spheres of
the outer-layer spheres (or

to serve as the polar axis of the
system spin. (See Secs.<A HREF="../s02/p2300.html#223.00">223</A>

 Thus by experimental evidence we may identify the
electron with the volume
of the regular, unit-vector-radius-edge tetrahedron,
the simplest symmetrical structural
system in Universe. We may further identify the <I>electron
tetrahedra</I> with the maximum
possible symmetrical aggregate of concentrically-packed,
unit-radius spheres
symmetrically surrounding a single nucleus<SUP>&#95;&#95;</SUP> there being
12 new potential nuclei appearing
in the three-frequency shell of 92 spheres, which three-frequency
shell, when
surroundingly embraced by the four-frequency shell of
162 spheres, buries the 12
candidate new nuclei only one shell deep, whereas qualifying
as full-fledged nuclei in their
own right requires two shells all around each, which
12, newborn nuclei event calls for the

 All of the foregoing is to say that the size of one
spinnable proton consisting
of 308 rhombic dodeca closest packed in the symmetrical
form of the four-frequency
vector equilibrium is 1836 times the size of one prime,
pre-time-size, prefrequency, unit-
vector-edge tetrahedron or of one electron. Multiplication
only by division means that the
time-size frequencies of the elements (other than hydrogen)
occur as various concentric-
shell symmetry phases of the single-nucleus-embracing,
symmetrically closest-packed,
single-nucleus aggregates in the multiconcentric-layered
forms of the vector equilibrium,
tetrahedron, octahedron, rhombic dodecahedron, rhombic
triacontahedron, and cube.

 Synergetics has long associated the electron with
the icosahedron.
Icosahedra cannot accommodate concentric shells; they
occur as single-layer shells of
closest-packed, unit-radius spheres. Since the <I>proton</I>
has only the outer shell count, it may
be identified with the icosa phase by having the total
volume of the rhombic-
dodecahedron-composed four-frequency vector equilibrium
transformed from the 306
(non-axial) <I>nucleon</I> rhombic dodecahedron into each of
the closest-packed, single-layer
icosahedra shells as an emitted wave entity. The rhombic
dodecahedron <I>neutrons</I> are
packed into concentric layers of the vector equilibria
to produce the various isotopes. For
example:
