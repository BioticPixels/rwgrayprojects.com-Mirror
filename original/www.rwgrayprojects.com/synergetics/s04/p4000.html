 Equilibrium between positive and negative is zero.
The vector equilibrium is
the true zero reference of the energetic mathematics.
Zero pulsation in the vector
equilibrium is the nearest approach we will ever know
to eternity and god: the zerophase
of conceptual integrity inherent in the positive and
negative asymmetries that propagate
the differentials of consciousness.

 The vector equilibrium is of the greatest importance
to all of us because all
the nuclear tendencies to implosion and explosion are
reversible and are always in exact
balance. The radials and the circumferentials are in
balance. But the important thing is that
the radials, which would tend to explode since they
are outwardly pushing, are always
frustrated by the tensile finiteness of the circumferential
vectors, which close together in
an orderly manner to cohere the disorderly asundering.
When the radial vectors are
tensilely contractive and separately implosive, they
are always prevented from doing so by
the finitely closing pushers or compressors of the circumferential
set of vectors. The
integrity of Universe is implicit in the external finiteness
of the circumferential set and its
surface-layer, close-packing, radius-contracting proclivity
which always encloses the
otherwise divisive internal radial set of omnidirectional
vectors.

 The vector equilibrium is the anywhere, anywhen, eternally
regenerative,
event inceptioning and evolutionary accommodation and
will never be seen by man in any
physical experience. Yet it is the frame of evolvement.
It is not in rotation. It is sizeless
and timeless. We have its mathematics, which deals discretely
with the chordal lengths.
The radial vectors and circumferential vectors are the
same size.

 The vector equilibrium is a condition in which nature
never allows herself to
tarry. The vector equilibrium itself is never found
exactly symmetrical in nature's
crystallography. Ever pulsive and impulsive, nature
never pauses her cycling at
equilibrium: she refuses to get caught irrecoverably
at the zero phase of energy. She
always closes her transformative cycles at the maximum
positive or negative asymmetry
stages. See the delicate crystal asymmetry in nature.
We have vector equilibriums mildly
distorted to asymmetry limits as nature pulsates positively
and negatively in respect to
equilibrium. Everything that we know as reality has
to be either a positive or a negative
aspect of the omnipulsative physical Universe. Therefore,
there will always be positive and
negative sets that are ever interchangeably intertransformative
with uniquely differentiable
characteristics.

 <B>Zerophase:</B> Being the zerophase of energy the vector
equilibrium is
inherently invisible and non-empirically-discoverable,
which accounts for its having been
for so long unrecognized as the spontaneous equilibrious
model. As specialists, scientists
seek only the somethings. The vector equilibrium is
the only model of nonbeing zero-
inflection at the nonmoment of omniintertransformabilities,
where anything can happen
and must happen single-atomically within and multiatomically
without. Specializing
science, seeking only somethings, inherently overlooked
the nonthing vector equilibrium.
Vector equilibria in isotropic vector matrixes produce
the discontinuity of particles, while
the vector-weaving around the VE nuclei produce the
continuity of wave phenomena.

like sound or light,
has a limit speed of apprehending. There is no instant
cerebral cognition. These
apprehension lags automatically impose off-center human
cognition, which occasions the
sense of time in a timeless eternity. The sense of time
occasions the conception of life and
serial experience. The inherently invisible vector equilibrium
self-starters life and ever

tetrahedra, i.e., 32
planes in all, are congruent in the four visible planes
passing through their common vector

the positive and the negative phase
of the tetrahedra are in congruence in the center. They

 Vector equilibrium accommodates all the intertransformings
of any one
tetrahedron by polar pumping, or turning itself inside
out. Each vector equilibrium has
four directions in which it could turn inside out. It
uses all four of them through the vector
equilibrium's common center and generates eight tetrahedra.
The vector equilibrium is a
tetrahedron exploding itself, turning itself inside
out in four possible directions. So we get
eight: inside and outside in four directions. The vector
equilibrium is all eight of the
potentials.

 <B>Zerovolume Tetrahedron:</B> The zerovolume phenomenon altogether
avoids
the operationally prohibited concept of a plurality
of lines going through the same point at
the same time. In the zerovolume tetrahedron each of
the four great circles is folded into a
"bow tie" pair of double-bonded tetra, each of which
is double-bonded to the three others.
The eight vertexes of the eight tetrahedra at each of
their four open corners only
seemingly pass through each other, whereas each converges
to the other and turns around
divergently outward at 60 degrees, thus producing a
nucleus with an energy potential of
eight but presenting the topologically visual aspect
and enumeration of only one. (See

 <B>Terminal Condition:</B> The formula for the number of
balls in any one of the
concentric layers of the vector equilibrium is always
10F<SUP>2</SUP> + 2. The center ball of a vector
equilibrium is the zero layer. The layer frequency is
zero just as in the first layer the
frequency is one. So zero times 10 is zero; to the second
power is zero; plus two is two.
So the center ball has a value of two. The significance
is that it has its concavity and its
convexity. It has both insideness and outsideness. Its
center is as far as you can go inward.
You turn yourself inside out and come out in the outside
direction. Its inbound shell and
its outbound shell are equally valid, and though you
see them as congruent and as one,
they are two. This central sphere center is a cosmic
terminal condition.

 Let us consider a tetrahedron, which also always has
an externality and an
internality. At its internal center is its terminal
turn-aroundand-come-outward-again
condition. This is exactly why in physics there is a
cosmic limit point at which systems turn
themselves inside out. They get to the outside and they
turn themselves inside out and
come the other way. This is why radiation does not go
off into a higher velocity. Radiation
gets to a maximum velocity unrestrained in vacuo and
then turns itself inward again<SUP>&#95;&#95;</SUP> it
becomes gravity. Then gravity comes to its maximum concentration
and turns itself
around and goes outward<SUP>&#95;&#95;</SUP>becomes radiation again.

 <B>Coordinate Symmetry:</B> In coordinate symmetry, as the
faces of the
tetrahedron move in toward the opposite vertex, the
volume gets less at anexponential
velocity of the third power, its surfaces diminish at
a secondpower rate of change, and its
lines shorten at a covariation rate of the first power.
When all four of the tetrahedral faces
come to congruence with the same common nucleus of the
vector equilibrium, all three of
these different rates of size change come synchronously
to common zero size. The
constant tetrahedral foumess of vertexes and faces,
sixness of edges, insideness and
outsideness, convexity and concavity<SUP>&#95;&#95;</SUP>these integrated
constants of conceptuality never
change.

 <B>Turbining:</B> In looking at a tetrahedron, we see that
there are around any
one vertex three faces and three edges in beautiful
synchronization; we say that it all looks
simple and logical. We find, however, that the inventory
of three faces around each vertex
comes out of a total inventory of four that are always
available in the tetrahedron. On the
other hand, the inventory of three edges around each
vertex comes out of a total inventory
of six that are available. So the sixness and the foumess
are from very different total
quantity inventories. Somehow, around any one vertex
of the same system nature has
arranged to synchronize them in a neat three-to-three
balance while using them all in a
total symmetry despite their being supplied from their
differing inventories.

 Consider the case of the cheese tetrahedron (see Sec.
623.20), where we
push one of the faces toward the opposite vertex. We
can move that face in until it is
congruent with the opposite vertex. There is now no
volume, but we have agreed that the
condition of symmetry is a constant of the abstractly
conceptual system, the tetrahedron:
the sixness and the foumess are still there, but they
are empty. With one face congruent
with the opposite vertex, we have all four planes of
the tetrahedron going through the
same exact point at the same time, or theoretically
as close as we can ever get to exactly.
We also have six edges of the tetrahedron going through
the same point at the same time.
We have agreed that this is a condition that can never
happen in reality, but in the vector
equilibrium, where there is no size, we have the only
possible time when this would seem
to occur.

edges going through the
same theoretical point at the same moment. We have said
that this is a vector equilibrium
and in a zero condition and it is nonreality. Nature
would not permit it. But a moment
later, those six edges <I>turbine</I> around that point one
way or another<SUP>&#95;&#95;</SUP>and we have seen
plenty of models of the lines turbining around<SUP>&#95;&#95;</SUP>but we

tetrahedron to being a negative
tetrahedron, and it had theoretically to pass through
that point.

 Very clearly, vector equilibrium is a zero-size tetrahedron.
We have already
had tetrahedron as an indestructible phenomenon independent
of size. And then we have it
getting into its own true zero vector equilibrium. It
is a condition that nature apparently
does not permit in our life, but what we call physical
reality is always a positive and
