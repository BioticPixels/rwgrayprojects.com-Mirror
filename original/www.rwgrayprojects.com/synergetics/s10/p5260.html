 This leads us to comprehension of the significance
of life on Earth. On this
cosmic-energies-importing planet we find life impounding
those energies, taking random
receipts of cosmic radiation from the stars<SUP>&#95;&#95;</SUP> more importantly
the Sun<SUP>&#95;&#95;</SUP>and through
photosynthesis converting it into organized molecular
structures. We find the biologicals
making ever more intricately orderly patterns: the little
seed becoming a big, superbly
organized structural process, a tree, rearranging all
its energy receipts from Universe in a
beautiful and orderly way. And among the living we find
humans and humans' minds
reviewing the many brain-recorded, special case experiences
and from time to time
discovering generalized relationships interexisting
between and coordinating the separate
special-case phenomena. In pure principle these generalized
principles<SUP>&#95;&#95;</SUP>such as gravity<SUP>&#95;&#95;</SUP>
are operative and hold true throughout all experiences.
The history of humanity revolves
around humans' discovering these principles. Humans
also in due course discover
principles that encompass a plurality of principles.
Humanity trends toward ever greater
understanding of the significance of principles, each
of which, in order to be principles,
must be inherently eternal. The discovery of principles
occurs only with patience. Patience
is long-wave tuning and is the antithesis of impatience,
which is exclusively short-wave
tuning. The discovery of great principles inherently
requires a periodicity of adequate
increments of time. Only through the thought stimulation
of discovered and periodically
repeated patterns of interrelatedness can mind's discovery
of generalized principles occur.

 Physical Universe expands, and as its observed components
and aggregates
of components are found to be larger and larger, their
relative operating velocities increase
to cope with their greater and greater orbital travel
distances. But there seems to be a
constant limit velocity of all disintegrative, entropic
energy as manifest by the speed of all
types of electromagnetic radiation when measured linearly
in a vacuum tube. All the
various types of radiation<SUP>&#95;&#95;</SUP>ultraviolet, radio wave,
and X-ray<SUP>&#95;&#95;</SUP>reach speeds of about
000 miles per second, which is also 700 million miles
per hour, which incidentally is a
million times the speed of sound. These measurements
inspired much of Einstein's
exploratory thought. But we note that since light and
all other radiation is entropic<SUP>&#95;&#95;</SUP>ergo,
concomitantly disintegrative<SUP>&#95;&#95;</SUP>there is a <I>constant limit</I>
of disorderliness. Here nature turns
about and becomes more orderly. There is also a constant
limit of orderliness; this
absolute turnaround condition is that of the primitive
hierarchy. We discuss this elsewhere
(Sec.
 <A HREF="../s04/p4000.html#440.00">440</A>)
as the limits of pattern aberration in respect
to the vector equilibrium, i.e., to
the absolute or zerophase of generalized nuclear systems'
orderliness. Whereas the
physical disintegrates entropically to a limit of velocity
and disorder, the metaphysically
operative mind displays a reverse pattern to that of
physical entropy, wherewith to define
lastingly the mind seeks the orderliness of the principles
that are discovered. As the human
definitions can never be perfect, the metaphysical mind
of humans can only amplify and
simplify the human statement of the comprehensive orderliness
discovered and periodically
reconfirmed by further experiences.

 From time to time humans learn a little more about
a principle, but greater
familiarity does not change the principles themselves.
As further observation becomes
more comprehensive and refined, the statement of the
principle becomes ever more
incisive and ever less frequently modified and improved.
Since the principle itself is
eternally changeless, the more accurately it is defined,
the more unchangeable is the
definition. The word <I>truth</I> is applicable to an earnestly
attempted statement of any
observed or recollected special case experience. Recollection
of a plurality of truths may
lead to discovery of a generalized principle intercoordinating
the special case experiences.
Recollection of truths leads toward discovery of generalized
principles. Thus we find the
metaphysical definitions of human minds tending to become
ever more enduring as human
mind trends toward the only absolute perfection, which
is the eternal integrity of the
omniinteraccommodation of all principles.

 Thus do words evolve and accumulate to fill the dictionaries
as humans
discover mutually shared conceptions regarding their
common experiences, each of which
requires unique and incisive means of identification
and communicability. That all humans,
always starting naked, helpless, and ignorant, have
through the ages so truthfully identified
over a hundred thousand experiences each of which is
so unique as to deserve<SUP>&#95;&#95;</SUP>indeed
require<SUP>&#95;&#95;</SUP>a uniquely identifying word, and that humans,
despite their propensity to
withhold agreement upon any mutual convention, have
agreed upon some hundred
thousand more or less common words and upon many more
hundreds of thousands of
scientific words, constitutes the greatest extant memorial
in testimony of the supra-ethnic
and transgeneration growth of the means of human communication,
common
understanding, and ultimate integration of all human
concern and ever more effectively
informed coordination of all human initiatives.

 Vitamin D from Sunlight is essential to humans
because calcium is
essential to the human bone structure. Humans synthesize
vitamin D through the
action of the Sun's ultraviolet rays on the skin. This
biochemical function is a
zoological counterpart of botanical photosynthesis.
But vitamin D is one of those
vitamins of which humans can have an overdose. In warmer
climes, where vitamin D
from the Sun is adequate or excessive, humans' subconsciously
functioning
organisms employ their chemical-process options to develop
Sunlight filters in the
skin consisting of darker and darker pigments that prevent
excessive absorption of
radiation and avoid the overdose of vitamin D. Where
there is not much Sunlight, as
in the far north, human organisms had to progressively
remove their pigment filters,
which left only light skin that permitted maximum synthesis
of vitamin D from the
Sun. But dark skin was the norm. The skin pigmentation
effect on human organisms
is a generalized phenomenon like that of diet, wherein
undernourishment alone can
account for mental dullness in otherwise healthy humans.
Physiognomic and
physiological differentiations in humans result solely
from generations of unplanned
inbreeding of those types that survive most successfully
under unique environmental
conditions within which tribes or nations dwelt for
protracted periods. Thus there is
scientific evidence that there is no organic class or
species differentiations of
humanity. This thesis is further elaborated in my essay
<I>No Race No Class.</I>
Communication is ultimately independent of culture or
race or class.)

 The metaphysical drive of humanity is toward total
comprehension and an
eternally changeless definition of all understanding.
Despite the limited conditions
governing our special-case human lives we can discern
the syntropic cosmic trending of
the metaphysical slowdown toward eternal changelessness
in inverse complementation of
the entropic physical trend to ever greater acceleration
toward terminal velocity,
frequency, and disorderliness at the speed of all radiation
in vacuo. The metaphysical
eternity is inherently absolute, whereas physical acceleration
is terminated only by
exhaustion. The physical limit is special case and suggestively
alterable. The metaphysical
limit is absolute and unalterable.

 The metaphysical is comprehensively generalizable.
The physical is always
realized only as special case experience. The metaphysical
reorders the disorderly-prone
physical. The metaphysical continually seeks to comprehend,
master, harness, and cohere
the physical. The metaphysical comprehends and reorders.
Humans oscillate between the
pushes of their physical incarnation and the tensing
of their metaphysical propensities. This
ubiquitous push-pulling propagates cosmic regenerativity.

 The regeneration may be that of a complete new baby
or the local
regeneration of cells in an ongoing organism. Rebirth
is continual. The overall growth and
refinement of information and comprehension by continuous
humanity transcends the
separate generations of life and steadies toward eternal
unalterability; the special case
physical experiences and the identification of their
significance in the overall scheme of
eternal cosmic regenerativity ever accelerate as the
information bits multiply exponentially;
wherefore the overall rate of gain of metaphysical comprehension
of the physical behavior
in general accelerates exponentially in respect to such
arithmetical periodicities as that of
the celestial cycles of the solar system.

 The physical Universe is an aggregate of frequencies.
Each chemical element
is uniquely identifiable in the electromagnetic spectrum
by its special set of unique
frequencies. These frequency sets interact to produce
more complexly unique cycle
frequencies, which are unheard by human ear but which
resonate just as do humanly
hearable musical chords or dissonances. Thus occurs
a great cosmic orchestration, ranging
from the microcosmic nuclear isotropicity<SUP>&#95;&#95;</SUP>directly undetectable
by the human senses<SUP>&#95;&#95;</SUP>
through the minuscule range detectable by humans, to
the very complex, macrocosmic,
supra-to-human-tunability symphonies of multiaggregates
of isotropically interpositioned
galaxies. (Compare Secs.

 Thus develops our human awareness of the special-case
physical experience
events that spontaneously trigger the metaphysical faculties
of humans into applying their
extraordinary sorting capabilities. The more metaphysically
sensitive and comprehendingly
effective humans become, the more truly do they fulfill
the unique cosmic function for
which they were designedly included in the scheme of
eternally regenerative Universe. If
we seek one word that most succinctly identifies the
experience we call life, it is
<I>awareness.</I> Since no weight is lost as individual life
terminates, and since all the chemical
ingredients are as yet present and all the sense organs
and their separate information-
integrating brains are also intact, we have to conclude
that the awareness of otherness,
which we identify as the prime characteristic of human
life, is indeed a weightless idea, or
thought concept, of an also weightless metaphysical
thinker. Life is not the corporeal
chemical complex. Life is only metaphysical.

 Humans are born into their physical-sensing and information-inventorying
organism not only to experience Universe but to cope
with local problem-solving in
support of the eternal regenerative integrity of ever
complexedly intertransforming
physical Universe, employing their metaphysical minds
to discover the metaphysical
slowdown toward the eternal generalized principles governing
Universe: and thereafter to
define the principles ever more adequately, incisively,
and inclusively until the frequency of
redefinability decreases toward zero. Thus the metaphysical
processing of humanity's
cognition of a generalized principle tends in time to
slow toward zero. It must be noted,
however, that the metaphysical mind's tools of communication
with other temporal

 We will think of two spheres inside a closed elastic
membrane so smoothly
intimate to each that, when the two spheres are tangent
to one another, they appear as two
clearly independent spheres momentarily in kissing tangency,
the membrane continuity
between the two being so intimately clinging as to be
observationally subvisible. But as the
two spheres are pulled apart, the elastic membrane is
locally stretch-pulled away evenly
from the surface of each sphere, and the membrane tube
running between the two
contracts to a progressively invisible, fine-line, spider-thread
tube stretched between the
two spheres. As the two spheres are pulled further apart,
the tube between the two remote
spheres will appear to be an invisible line-of-sight
perpendicular to each of the enclosed
spheres.

 As the spheres are next allowed to approach one another,
the everywhere
self-together-gathering proclivity of the elastic membrane
providing the elastic tube
between them will redistribute its perpendicular linear
multitude of atoms back in both
directions, yielding equally to the two stretched membranes
around each sphere in much
the same way as atoms in a thin stream of viscous maple
syrup impinging vertically on a
stack of pancakes will spread out in all directions
to envelop the pancakes. Thus the two-
way flowing stream of stretched-far-apart atoms of the
omnihugging elastic membrane
tightly embracing the two reapproaching-to-one-another
spheres flows outwardly at 90
degrees to their perpendicular impingement to reenvelop
thickly each of the two spheres.
This means that the linear length of the tautly stretched
tube reopens itself at the point of
tangency to enclose each of the tube's separate spheres.
The atoms previously invested in
the remote-from-one-another, stretched-out tube of tension
between the two spheres have
now returned to the two spheres and have rejoined their
nearest neighboring atoms around
the elastic-membrane spherical sheath of the two tangent
spheres.

 What had been a linear requirement becomes a surface
requirement for the
elastic membrane. Surfaces of omnisymmetrical geometrical
objects are always second
powers of the object's linear dimensions. If we were
to remove one of the spheres from
the omniclingingly embracing sheath, the elastic membrane
would snap-contract to enclose
only the remaining sphere, but the rate of atomic population
gain of the spherical, surface-
clinging membrane derived from the previous intersphere
linear tendon is of the second
power of the arithmetical rate of linear contraction
of the elastic tendon. Soon the
thickness of the membrane on each sphere would multiply
into a plurality of closest-
packed atomic layers, and the volume of the atoms will
thus increase at a third-power rate
in respect to an arithmetical rate of distance-halving
between any two spheres. This two-
sphere-embracing, few-atoms-thick, clinging elastic
membrane fed into, or spread out
from, an intersphere tension may be thought of as an
electromagnetic membrane acting
just like electric charges fed onto the convex surface
of a copper Van de Graaff sphere or
a copper wire (electric charges always inhabiting only
the convex surfaces).

 To understand the linear expansion rate think of making
soap bubbles:
Deeply layered molecules get stretched into a single
layer as the single atoms guarantee
the interattractiveness integrity of the area-stretching
thin-out of the atoms. We now come
to the balancing of the vectors of the vector equilibrium
and the arrangement of the 24
external vectors end-to-end, closing back upon themselves<SUP>&#95;&#95;</SUP>in
four great-circle planes,
constituting an "additional" vector force magnitude
of 24, embracing the outwardly and
separatingly exploding 24 internal vectors, which now
operate in increasing independence
of one another<SUP>&#95;&#95;</SUP>each thus producing a force of only one.
We have the surface net
drawing on a force resource of 24<SUP>&#95;&#95;</SUP>multiplied by radius
frequency to the second power<SUP>&#95;&#95;</SUP>
while the originally-24-force, radially explosive events
separate out from one another and
thus produce only separate first-power effectiveness.
Hence the gravitational force's
geometrical progression rate of gain<SUP>&#95;&#95;</SUP>i.e., its second-power,
surface-embracing finiteness
closure is always at a high-energy effectiveness advantage
over the disintegrative, linear,
first-power, or only arithmetical progression rate of
gain in force.
