may be symmetrical or superficially asymmetrical in
the form of crocodiles, alligators,
pears, or billiard balls, they constitute complexedly
bonded associations of prime structural
systems. Only the tetrahedral, octahedral, and icosahedral
domains are basic structural
systems without nuclei. All the Platonic polyhedra and
many other more complex,
multidimensional symmetries of sphere groupings can

octahedron, and icosahedron, can be
symmetrically produced by closest-packed spheres without
any interioral, i.e., nuclear,

 <B>Prime Enclosure:</B> Omnitopology describes prime volumes.
Prime volume
domains are described by Euler's minimum set of visually
unique topological aspects of
polyhedral systems. Systems divide Universe into all
Universe occurring outside the
system, all Universe occurring inside the system, and
the remainder of Universe
constituting the system itself. Any point or locus inherently
lacks insideness. Two event
points cannot provide enclosure. Two points have betweenness
but not insideness. Three
points cannot enclose. Three points describe a volumeless
plane. Three points have
betweenness but no insideness. A three-point array plus
a fourth point that is not in the
plane described by the first three points constitutes
<I>prime enclosure.</I> It requires a
minimum of four points to definitively differentiate
cosmic insideness and outsideness, i.e.,
to differentiate macrocosm from microcosm, and to differentiate
both of them from <I>here</I>
and <I>now.</I>

 Systems are domains of volumes. One difference between
a domain and a
volume is that a domain cannot have an interior point,
because if it did, it would be subject
to more economical subdivision. For instance, the vector
equilibrium is a system and has a
volume, but it consists of 20 domains. A vector equilibrium
is not a prime domain or a
prime volume, because it has a nucleus and consists
of a plurality of definitive volumetric
domains. The vector equilibrium is inherently subdivisible
as defined by most economical
triangulation of all its 12 vertexes into eight tetrahedra
and 12 quarter-octahedra,
constituting 20 identically volumed, minimum prime domains.

 <B>Hierarchy of Nuclear Aggregations:</B> The prime nuclear
aggregation of
spheres around one sphere is the vector equilibrium.
Vector equilibrium constitutes the
prime nuclear group because it consists of the least
number of spheres that can be closest
packed omnitangentially around one nuclear sphere. The
vector equilibrium provides the
most volumetrically economical pattern of aggregation
of 12 balls around a nuclear ball of
the same diameter as the 12 surrounding balls; the 13th
ball is the center. In other words,
is the lowest possible number connected with a structurally
stable triangulated nucleus,
being omnitriangularly interconnected both radially
and circumferentially.

 An octahedron is at minimum a prime system. Prime systems
are generalized.
To be realized experimentally in special-case time-space,
the octahedron must consist of a
high-frequency aggregate of octahedral and tetrahedral
components. An octahedral system
gains a nucleus with 19 balls, i.e., with 18 uniradius
balls around one, as against the
minimum nucleated (four-frequency) tetrahedral array
of 35 balls, i.e., with 34 balls
symmetrically around one. So the octahedron gains a
nucleus at a lower frequency than
does the tetrahedron.

 Whether at zero-frequency or multifrequency state,
the icosahedron cannot
have a tangentially contiguous, ergo statically structural,
nuclear sphere of the same radius
as those of its closest-packed, single, outer-layer
array. It can only have a dynamically
structured nucleus whose mass is great enough to impose
critical-proximity central
dominance over its orbitally icosahedrally arrayed,
remotely co-orbiting constellation of
concentrated energy events.

 The vector equilibrium has four hexagonally perimetered
planes intersecting
each other symmetrically at its center; while the octahedron
has only three square-
perimetered planes symmetrically intersecting one another
at its center. The hexagon has
room at its center for a uniradius circle tangent to
each of the six circles tangent to one
another around it; whereas the square does not have
room for such a uniradius circle.
Wherefore the minimal four-dimensional coordinate system
of the vector equilibrium is the
minimum inherently nucleated system. (This is why mathematical
physics employing three-
dimensional, XYZ coordination can only accommodate its
experimental evidence of the
atomic nucleus by amorphous mathematics.) Like the octahedron,
the vector equilibrium
also has eight triangular facets; while also explosively
extroverting the octahedron's three
square central planes, in two ways, to each of its six
square external facets, thus providing
seven unique planes, i.e. seven-dimensionality. And
while the octahedron develops a
nucleus at a lower number than does the tetrahedron<SUP>&#95;&#95;</SUP>or
more economically than a
tetrahedron<SUP>&#95;&#95;</SUP>it is indicated that the nuclear arrays
are symmetrical and play very great
parts in compound chemistry. (The cube develops a nucleus
only at a relatively high
frequency.) In each one of these, there may be hierarchies
that identify the difference
between organic and inorganic chemistries. Due to the
fact that there are nuclear
aggregations in symmetry to which all of our chemistries
relate, we may find an organic
and inorganic identification of the tetrahedral and
octahedral nucleations. The nonnuclear,
exclusively volumetric, single-layer, closest-packed,
icosahedral aggregate may be
identified with the electron "shells" of the compounding
atoms.

 Three <I>linear</I> events have two intervals, which is the

The circuit is closed and operative

than two. Equi-interval = "tuned." This is why wave-frequency

 Prime tetrahedra and octahedra do not have nuclei.
In contradistinction to
prime tetrahedra and prime octahedra, some complex tetrahedra,
complex octahedra, and
complex cubes do have a nucleus. They do not develop
structurally in strict conformity to
closest packing to contain an internal or nuclear ball
until additional closest-packed,
uniradius sphere layers are added. For instance, the
cubical array produced by nesting
eight uniradius spheres in the center of the eight triangulated
sphere arrays of the nuclear-
balled vector equilibrium produces eight tetrahedra
single-bondedly arrayed around a
nuclear ball. Additional, and symmetrically partial,
layers require identification as
frequency of reoccurrence of concentric shell embracement.
In contradistinction to the
other two prime system domains, however, the icosahedron
does not accommodate
additional closest-packed sphere layers and never develops
a static structural nucleus. The
icosahedron's closest-packing capability is that of
circumferential propagation of only one
omni-intertriangulated uniradius sphere and can increase
its frequency only as one shell
and not as a nucleus.

 If the icosahedron does develop a further outward shell,
it will have to
discard its internal shell because the central angles
of the icosahedron will not allow room
for unit-radius spheres of two or more closest-packed
omnitriangulated concentric shells
to be constructed. Only one closest-packed shell at
a time is permitted. Considered

uniradius, outer shell.

 Speaking externally, either "prime" or complex "frequency"
tetrahedra and
octahedra may interagglomerate with one another close-packingly
to fill allspace, while
icosahedron may never do so. The icosahedra may be face-associated
to constitute an
ultimately large octahedral structure. Icosahedra may
also symmetrically build
independent, closest-packed, tetrahedral arrays outwardly
on each of their multi-
frequenced, 20 triangular facets. Thus it is seen that
the icosahedral closest packing can
only grow inside-outedly, as does the vector equilibrium
grow internally, i.e. inside-
inwardly.

 While the regular icosahedron's radius is shorter in
length than its external
edge chords, the vector equilibrium has the same radius
as each of its edge chords; which

 <B>Congruence of Vectors:</B> All vector equilibria of any

always exactly and balancingly contain
their circumferentially integrated<SUP>&#95;&#95;</SUP>and therefore more
embracing than internally
disintegrating<SUP>&#95;&#95;</SUP>forces as manifest by their vectorial
edge chords. The vector equilibrium
consists of four symmetrically interacting hexagonal
planes. Each hexagon displays six
radially disintegrative, independently operative, therefore
uncompounded, central vectors
and their equal-magnitude six, always cooperatively
organized and compounded,
circumferential chord vectors. Sum-totally, the four
hexagons have 24 radial disintegrative
vectors and 24 chordally integrative vectors, with the
chordals occurring as four closed
sets of six vectors each and the radials as four open
sets of six vectors each. The planes of
any two hexagons of the set of four intersect one another
in such a manner that the radii of
any two intersecting planes are congruent, while the
chords are not. This paired
congruency of the 24 radial-disintegrative vectors of
the four hexagons reduces their
visible number to 12. The 24 chordally integrative vectors
remain separate and visible as
24 finitely closed in four embracing sets of six each.

 The phenomenon "congruence of vectors" occurs many
times in nature's
coordinate structuring, destructuring, and other intertransformings,
doubling again
sometimes with four vectors congruent, and even doubling
the latter once again to
produce eight congruent vectors in limit-transformation
cases, as when all eight tetrahedra
of the vector equilibrium become congruent with one
another. (See Sec.
 <A HREF="../s04/p6000.html#461.08">461.08</A>.) This
phenomenon often misleads the uninformed observer.

 <B>Instability of Vector Equilibrium:</B> If we remove the
12 internal,
congruently paired sets of 24 individual radii and leave
only the 24 external chords, there
will remain the eight corner-interlinked, externally
embracing triangles, each of which
(being a triangle) is a structure. Between the eight
triangular external facets of the vector
equilibrium, there also occur six squares, which are
not structures. The six square
untriangulated faces are the external facets of six
nonstructurally stabilized half-octahedra,
each of whose four central triangular faces had been
previously defined by the now
removed 24 radially paired vectors of the vector equilibrium.
A half-octahedron, to be
stable, has to be complementingly square-face-bonded
with its other half. The prime
vector equilibrium has only these six half-octahedra,
wherefore the circumferential
instability of its six square faces invites structural
instability. Thus deprived of its internal
triangular structuring by removal of all its radial
vectors, the vector equilibrium becomes
disequilibrious.

 The edge frequency of two intervals between three balls
of each of the
vector equilibrium's 24 outer edges identifies the edges
of the eight outer facet triangles of
the vector equilibrium's eight edge-bonded (i.e., double-bonded)
tetrahedra, whose
common internal vertex is congruent with the vector
equilibrium's nuclear sphere. In each
of the vector equilibrium's square faces, you will see
nine spheres in planar arrays, having
one ball at the center of the eight (see Illus.
 <A HREF="../s02/p2000.html#222.01">222.01</A>),
each of whose eight edge spheres
belong equally to the adjacent tetrahedra's outwardly
displayed triangular faces. This
single ball at the center of each of the six square
faces provides the sixth sphere to stabilize
each of the original six half-octahedra formed by the
nuclear ball of the vector equilibrium
common with the six half-octahedra's common central
vertex around the six four-ball
square groups showing on the prime vector equilibrium's
surface. This second layer of 42
spheres thus provides the sixth and outermost ball to
complete the six-ball group of a
prime octahedron, thus introducing structural stability
increasing at a fourth-power rate to
the vector equilibrium.

 With the 42-ball layer added to the vector equilibrium,
there is no ball
showing at the center of any of the triangular faces
of the vector equilibrium. The three-
ball edges of the 42-ball vector equilibrium provide
a frequency of two. Three spheres in a

area of the adjacent spheres constitute the vectorial
interconnections that provide the

has 92 balls; its
frequency is three, but there are four balls to any
one edge. The edges are all common to
the next facet, so we only have to credit the balls

 Though there is one ball in the center of each of the
eight triangular facets of
the F<SUP>3</SUP> vector equilibrium, those balls are exposed on
the outer surface of their respective
tetrahedra and are not omnidirectionally and omnitangentially
enclosed, as they would
have to be to constitute a fully developed regenerative-system
nucleus. Though outer-
facetly centered (i.e., planarly central), those eight
F<SUP>3</SUP>, triangularly centered balls are not
nuclei. To become nuclei, they must await further symmetrically
complete, concentric,
closest-packed, vector-equilibrium shell embracements
which bring about a condition
wherein each of the eight new potential nuclei are embraced
omnidirectionally and
omnitangentially in closest-packed triangulation by
a minimum of two shells exclusively
unique to themselves, i.e., not shared by any neighboring
nuclei. The F<SUP>3</SUP> vector
equilibrium's triangular facets' central surface-area
balls are, however, the initial
appearance in symmetrical, concentric, vector-equilibrium
shell frequency growth of such
potentially developing embryo nuclei. They are the first
potential nuclei to appear in the

 Any sphere is in itself a potential nucleus, but it

 In the 92-ball, F<SUP>3</SUP> third shell, eight potential nuclei
occur in the triangular
facets. "Four" and "square" do not constitute a structural
array. To be structural is to be
triangulated. Four balls also occur in each of the square
facets, whereas one ball had
occurred in the center of each of the six square facets
of the previous F<SUP>2</SUP>, 42-ball layer.
This means that at the F<SUP>3</SUP>, 92-ball layer, there are
five balls in each of the six square-face
centers. These five will be complemented by one or more,
thus to form six new,
detachable, nonnucleated, prime octahedra in the F<SUP>4</SUP>,
 162-ball layer by a square group of
nine balls in each of the six square facets of the vector
equilibrium. The center ball of these
nine will now join with the four balls of the F<SUP>3</SUP> layer
and the one ball of the F<SUP>2</SUP> layer to
form altogether a prime, closest-packed octahedron having
no nucleus of its own.

that each has as yet only the 12 balls around it of

 Let us take three balls arranged in a triangle. We
then take two other
uniradius tangent balls lying in the same plane and
address them symmetrically to any one
corner-ball of the first three so that we have two rows
of three balls crossing one another
with one ball centrally common to both three-ball lines;
so that we have two symmetrically
arrayed triangles with one common corner. Obviously
the center ball<SUP>&#95;&#95;</SUP>like a railway
switch<SUP>&#95;&#95;</SUP>has to serve alternately either one three-ball
track or the other, but never both at
the same time, which would cause a smash-up. If we do
the same thing four-dimensionally
for the eight tetrahedra of the vector equilibrium,
we find that the nuclear center ball is
accommodating any one or any pair of the eight tetrahedra
and is interconnecting them all.
Externally, the eight tetrahedra's 24 vertexes share
12 points; internally, their eight
vertexes share one point. The common center ball, being
two-in-one (unity two), can be
used for a pulse or a space; for an integer or a zero.

 Applying the Indig-Numerology to the multiplication
tables, this wave
phenomenon reappears dramatically, with each integer
having a unique operational effect
on other integers. For instance, you look at the total
multiplication patterns of the prime
numbers three and five and find that they make a regular
X. The foumess ( = + 4) and the
fiveness ( = - 4) are at the positive-negative oscillation
center; they decrease and then
increase on the other side where the two triangles come
together with a common center in
bow-tie form. You find that the sequences of octaves
are so arranged that the common
ball can be either number eight or it could be zero
or it could be one. That is, it makes it
possible for waves to run through waves without having
interference of waves. (See
drawings section.)

 The vector equilibrium as the prime convergence-divergence,
i.e., gravity-
radiation nucleus, provides the nuclear nothingness,
the zero point where waves can go
through waves without interfering with other waves.
The waves are accommodated by the
zeroness, by the octave of four positive and four negative
phasings, and by a nuclear
terminal inside-outing and a unique pattern-limit terminal
outside-inning. But there are two
kinds of positives and negatives: an inside-outing and
an arounding. These are the <I>additive
twoness</I> and the <I>multiplicative twoness.</I> The central
ball then is an inside-outness and has
its poles so it can accommodate either as a zeroness
a wave that might go around it or go
through it, without breaking up the fundamental resonance
of the octaves.

 <B>Pumping Model:</B> The center ball of a vector equilibrium
is zero. The
frequency is zero, just as in the first layer the frequency
is one. So zero times ten is zero;
to the second power is zero; plus two is two. So the
center ball has a value of two. The
significance is that it has its concave and its convex.
It has both insideness and outsideness
congruently. It is as far as you can go. You turn yourself
inside out and go in the other
direction again. This is a terminal condition.

 We have then a tetrahedron that has an external and
an internal: a terminal
condition. Gravity converts to radiation. This is exactly
why, in physics, Einstein's
supposition is correct regarding the conservation of
Universe: it turns around at both the
maximum of expansion and the minimum of contraction,
because there is clearly provided
a limit and its mathematical accommodation at which
it turns itself inside out.

 You get to the outside and you turn yourself outside-in;
you come to the
center and turn yourself inside-out. This is why radiation
does not go to higher velocity.
Radiation gets to a maximum and then turns itself inwardly
again<SUP>&#95;&#95;</SUP>it becomes gravity.
Then gravity goes to its maximum concentration and turns
itself and goes outwardly,
becomes radiation. The zero nineness-nucleus provides
the means.
