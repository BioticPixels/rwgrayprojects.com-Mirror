 The potential activation of tetravolume quantation
in the geometric hierarchy
is still subfrequency but accounts for the doubling
of volumetric space. The potential
activation of tetravolume accounting is plural; it provides
for nucleation. Primitive
tetravolume accounting is singular and subnuclear.

This annihilation of the three octahedra accommodates
both axial rotation
and its linear contraction of the eight regular tetrahedra
radiantly arrayed around the
nucleus of the vector equilibrium. These eight tetrahedra
may be considered as four<SUP>&#95;&#95;</SUP>also
alternately polarizable<SUP>&#95;&#95;</SUP>pairs. As the axis rotates and
shortens, the eight tetra pair into
four congruent (or quadrivalent) tetrahedral sets. This
omnisymmetrically accomplished
contraction from the VE's 20-ness to the quadrivalent
octahedron of tetravolume-4
represents a topologically unaccounted for<SUP>&#95;&#95;</SUP>but synergetically
conceptualized<SUP>&#95;&#95;</SUP>
annihilation of 16 tetravolumes, i.e., 16 energy quanta,
12 of which are synergetically
accounted for by the collapse of the three internal
octahedra (each of four quanta); the
other four-quanta loss is accounted for by the radial
contraction of each of the VE's eight
tetrahedra (eight quanta) into the form of Eighth-Octahedra

 The six new vector diagonals of the three pairs of
opposing half-octahedra
become available to provide for the precession of any
one of the equatorial quadrangular
vectors of the half-octahedra to demonstrate the intertransformability
of the octahedron as
a conservation and annihilation model. (See Sec.
 <A HREF="../s09/p3400.html#935.00">935</A>.)
In this transformation the
octahedron retains its apparent topological integrity
of 6V + 8F = 12E + 2, while
transforming from four tetravolumes to three tetravolumes.
This tetrahelical evolution
requires the precession of only one of the quadrangular
equatorial vector edges, that edge
nearest to the mass-interattractively precessing neighboring
mass passing the octahedron
(as matter) so closely as to bring about the precession
and its consequent entropic discard
of one quantum of energy<SUP>&#95;&#95;</SUP>which unbalanced its symmetry
and resulted in the three
remaining quanta of matter being transformed into three
quanta of energy as radiation.

 The vector equilibrium contraction from tetravolume
20 to the tetravolume 4
of the octahedron may be accomplished symmetrically
(as just described in Sec.
 <A HREF="p33180.html#1033.30">1033.30</A>)
by altogether collapsing the unstable six half-octahedra
and by symmetrical contraction of
the 12 radii. The angular collapsing of the 12 radii
is required by virtue of the collapsings
of the six half-octahedra, which altogether results
in the eight regular tetrahedra being
concurrently reduced in their internal radial dimension,
while retaining their eight external
equiangular triangles unaltered in their prime-vector-edge
lengths; wherefore, the eight
internal edges of the original tetrahedra are contractively
reduced to eight asymmetric
tetrahedra, each with one equiangular, triangular, external
face and with three right-angle-
apexed and prime-vector-base-edged internal isosceles-triangle
faces, each of whose
interior apexes occurs congruently at the center of
volume of the symmetrical
octahedron<SUP>&#95;&#95;</SUP>ergo, each of which eight regular-to-asymmetric-transformed
tetrahedra are
now seen to be our familiar Eighth-Octahedra, each of
which has a volume of l/2
tetravolume; and since there are eight of them (8 &#215;
1/2 = 4), the resulting octahedron
equals tetravolume-4.

 This transformation may also have been accomplished
in an alternate
manner. We recall how the jitterbug vector equilibrium
demonstrated the four-dimensional
freedom by means of which its axis never rotates while
its equator is revolving (see Sec.
<A HREF="../s04/p6000.html#460.02">460.02</A>).
Despite this axis and equator differentiation the whole
jitterbug is simultaneously
and omnisymmetrically contracting in volume as its 12
vertexes all approach their common
center at the same radial contraction rate, moving within
the symmetrically contracting
surface to pair into the six vertices of the octahedron<SUP>&#95;&#95;</SUP>after
having passed symmetrically
through that as-yet-12-vectored icosahedral stage of
symmetry. With that complex
concept in mind we realize that the nonrotating axis
was of necessity contracting in its
overall length; ergo, the two-vertex-to-two-vertex-bonded
"pair" of regular tetrahedra
whose most-remotely-opposite, equiangular triangular
faces' respective centers of area
represented the two poles of the nonrotated axis around
which the six vertices at the
equator angularly rotated<SUP>&#95;&#95;</SUP>three rotating slantwise "northeastward"
and three rotating
"southeastward," as the northeastward three spiraled
finally northward to congruence with
the three corner vertices of the nonrotating north pole
triangle, while concurrently the
three southeastward-slantwise rotating vertices originally
situated at the VE jitterbug
equator spiral into congruence with the three corner
vertices of the nonrotating south pole
triangle.

 As part of the comprehensively symmetrical contraction
of the whole
primitive VE system, we may consider the concurrent
north-to-south polar-axis
contraction (accomplished as the axis remained motionless
with respect to the equatorial
motions) to have caused the two original vertex-to-vertex
regular polar tetrahedra to
penetrate one another vertexially as their original
two congruent center-of-VE-volume
vertices each slid in opposite directions along their
common polar-axis line, with those
vertices moving toward the centers of area, respectively,
of the other polar tetrahedron's
polar triangle, traveling thus until those two penetrating
vertices came to rest at the center

 As we explore the interbonding (valencing) of the evolving

components, we soon discover that the universal interjointing
of systems<SUP>&#95;&#95;</SUP>and their

into congruence of vertexes (single
bonding), vectors (double bonding), faces (triple bonding),

or one face aspect. The Eulerean topological accounting
as presently practiced<SUP>&#95;&#95;</SUP>innocent

each of these

 Only by recognizing the deceptiveness of Eulerean topology
can synergetics
account for the primitive total inventories of all aspects
and thus conceptually demonstrate
and prove the validity of Boltzmann's concepts as well
as those of all quantum
phenomena. Synergetics' mathematical accounting conceptually
interlinks the operational
data of physics and chemistry and their complex associabilities
manifest in geology,
biology, and other disciplines.

 Defining frequency in terms of interval requires a
minimum of three intervals
between four similar system events. (See Sec.
 <A HREF="../s05/p2400.html#526.23">526.23</A>.)
Defining frequency in terms of
cycles requires a minimum of two cycles. Size requires
time. Time requires cycles. An
angle is a fraction of a cycle; angle is subcyclic.
Angle is independent of time. But angle is
conceptual; angle is angle independent of the length
of its edges. You can be conceptually
aware of angle independently of experiential time. Angular
conceptioning is metaphysical;
all physical phenomena occur only in time. Time and
size and special-case physical reality
begin with frequency. Pre-time-size conceptuality is
<I>primitive</I> conceptuality.
Unfrequenced angular topology is primitive. (See Sec.
