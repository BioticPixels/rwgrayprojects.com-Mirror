 In the 20-tetravolume vector equilibrium we have four
passive and four
active tetrahedra vertexially interconnected. The eight
tetrahedra have a total of 32
vertexes. In the 20-tetravolume vector equilibrium each
tetrahedron has three of its
vertexial somethings outwardly arrayed and one vertexial
something inwardly arrayed.
Their 24 externally arrayed vertexes are <I>congruently
paired</I> to form the 12 vertexes of the
vector equilibrium, and their eight interior vertexial
somethings are <I>nuclear congruent;</I>
ergo, four-forcedly-more-vector-interconstrained than
any of their externally paired
vertexial something sets: an untenable equilibrium compulsion
(UEC). (Compare Secs.

 1033.032  The untenable equilibrium compulsion (UEC) inherently
impels the nucleus
toward and through any of the nucleus's eight externally
subtended triangular windows,
the three corners of each of which are two-tensor-restrained
(six tensors per triangular
window) by the gravitationally embracing, circumferentially
closed tensors. This
empowers the nuclear eightfold-congruent somethings
to exit pulsatingly through the
windows to a distance one-half that of the altitude
of the regular tetrahedron, which is
describable to the eight divergent points by mounting
outwardly of the eight Eighth-
Octahedra on each of the eight triangular window frames
of the vector equilibrium, which
thereby describe the cube of 24 tetravolumes (i.e.,
eight of the primitive, Duo-Tet-
described cubes of three tetravolumes). These eight
external pulsative points are inherently
center-of-volume terminalled when nuclear systems are
closest packed with one another.
Thus we find the total nuclear domain of Universe to
have a tetravolume of 24. When the
vector equilibrium nucleus has no closest-packed-around-it,
nucleated vector equilibrium
systems, then the eightfold nuclear impelment works
successively to expel its energies
pulsatingly and radiantly through all eight of its windows.

we would have a static

 The isotropic-vector-matrix-field has an infinite
range of electromagnetic
tunings that are always multiplying frequency by division
of the a priori vector equilibrium
and its contained cosmic hierarchy of timeless-sizeless
primitive systems' unfrequenced
state. At maximum their primitive comprehensive domain
is that of the six-tetravolume,
24-A-and-B-quanta-moduled, unfrequenced rhombic dodecahedron,
the long axis of
whose 12 diamond faces is also the <I>prime vector</I> length
of the isotropic vector matrix. At
primitive minimum the unfrequenced state is that of
the six-A-and-B-quanta-moduled
Syte. Both the maximum and minimum, primitive, greatest
and least primitive common
divisors of Universe may be replicatively employed or
convergently composited to
produce the isotropic vector matrix field of selectable
frequency tunability, whose key
wavelength is that of the relative length of the uniform
vector of the isotropic vector
matrix as initially selected in respect to the diameter
of the nucleus of the atom.

 Every electromagnetic wave propagation generates its
own cosmic field.
This field is a four-dimensional isotropic vector matrix
that can be readily conceptualized
as an aggregation of multilayered, closest-packed, unit-radius
spheres. (See Fig.
<A HREF="p33030.html#1033.111">1033.111A</A>.)
 Unit-radius spheres pack tangentially together most
closely in 60-degree
intertriangulations. Atoms close-pack in this manner.
The continuum of inherent
outsideness of all systems enters every external opening
of all closest-packed, unit-radius
sphere aggregates, permeating and omnisurrounding every
closest-packed sphere within
the total aggregate. Between the closest-packed, unit-radius
spheres the intervening voids
constitute a uniform series of unique, symmetrical,
curvilinear, geometrical shapes, and the
successive centers of volumes of those uniform phase
voids are uniformly interspaced<SUP>&#95;&#95;</SUP>
the distance between them being always the same as the
uniform distances between
adjacent closest-packed spheres.

 Each of the closest-packed, unit-radius spheres is
itself a geodesic sphere, a
spherical sieve with triangular openings: a tetra-,
octa-, or icosasphere of some frequency
of modular subdivision. (Compare the fallacy of the
Greek sphere as described at Secs.
 <A HREF="../s09/p7120.html#981.19">981.19</A>,
 <A HREF="p2000.html#1022.11">1022.11-13</A>,

each of the closest-packed
spheres is permeable by higher-frequency, shorter-wavelength,
electromagnetic
propagations; ergo, appropriately frequenced fields
may pass through the isotropic vector
matrix's electromagnetic field of any given wavelengths
without interference. Not only
does each closest-packed sphere consist of a plurality
of varifrequenced vertices
interconnected by chords that define the triangular
sieve, but also these vertexial
somethings are mass-interattractively positioned and
have their own boundary layer
(trampoline) cushions; ergo, they are never in absolute
tangency.

 The isotropic vector matrix grid illustrates that
frequency multiplication may
be accomplished only by division. The unit-radius spheres
of the isotropic vector matrix
electromagnetic fields close-pack in four planes of
symmetry, permitting four-dimensional
electromagnetic wavebands. The three-way, spherical,
electromagnetic, basketry
interweaving is illustrated at Fig.
 <A HREF="p33030.html#1033.111">1033.111B</A>.
There
are six great-circle equators of the six
axes formed by the 12 vertices of the spherical icosahedron.
The centers of area of the
spherical triangles thus formed describe the terminals
of the electromagnetic waveband
widths. The widths of the bands of frequency tunability
are determined by the
truncatability of the spherical icosahedron's six bands
as they run between the centers of
area of the adjacent triangles.

 In synergetic geometry we witness the transformation
of all spheres into
their local complementary inter-void domains as the
local inter-void domains transform
into closest-packed, unit-radius spheres. (See Fig.
<A HREF="p3230.html#1032.31">1032.31</A>.)
The multifrequenced
tetrahedral, octahedral, and icosahedral geodesic subdivisioning
of spherical projections of
the primitive polyhedral systems describes how the complex
interbonding of substances
occurs; it is further described by the varying radii
of the closest-packed spheres and the
complex of isotropic vector matrixes required to accommodate
the varying radii as well as
their ultra- and infrapermeating: this elucidates the
resonance of substances as well as the
unique electromagnetic frequencies of chemical elements.
Here is the grand synergetic
nexus integrating electromagnetics, chemistry, and topology.

 Synergetics arouses human awareness of the always-and-only-co-occurring,
non-tuned-in cosmic complementations of our only-from-moment-to-moment
systematically tuned-in conceptionings. Synergetics'
always symmetrical, complementarily
expanding and contracting intertransformings disclose
a succession of "local way
stations." Progressive arrival at these convergent-divergent
"way station" states discloses
a succession of immediately neighboring, larger-to-smaller,
symmetrical polyhedra of
diminishingly numbered topological characteristics,
which all together constitute a cosmic
hierarchy of symmetrical, rationally volumed, most primitive,
pattern-stabilization states.
Superficially the states are recognizable as the family

 As the originally omnisymmetrical, 20-tetravolume
vector equilibrium of 12
vertices, 14 faces, and 24 vector edges shrinks its
vertex-described spherical domain, it
may receive one quantum of energy released entropically
by some elsewhere-in-Universe
entropic radiation, as most frequently occurring when
octahedra of matter are precessed
and the octahedron's tetravolume 4 is reduced to tetravolume
3 (see Octahedron as
Conservation and Annihilation Model, Sec.
 <A HREF="../s09/p3400.html#935.00">935</A>), the
tetrahedron thus annihilated being
one quantum lost entropically without any alteration
of the Eulerean topological
characteristics as an octahedron. Since each quantum
consists of six vector edges that can
now be entropically dispersed, they may be syntropically
harvested by the 20-tetravolume
vector equilibrium, and, constituting one quantum of
energy, they will structurally stabilize
the shrinking 20-tetravolume vector equilibrium

the intermediate symmetrical form of the icosahedron.
As the icosahedron of 12 vertices,
20 faces, and 30 edges (24 + 6) shrinks its spherical
domain, it can do so only by
compressing the one energy quantum of six syntropically
captured vector edges into the
six vertical somethings of the octahedron, thereby allowing
12 faces to unite as six<SUP>&#95;&#95;</SUP>all

Simultaneously each of the paired vertices and edges<SUP>&#95;&#95;</SUP>as
