 Spherical Reference: Operationally speaking, the word
<I>omnidirectional</I>
involves a speaker who is observing from some viewing
point. He says, "People and things
are going every which way around me." It seems chaotic
to him at first, but on further
consideration he finds the opposite to be true, that
only inherent order is being manifest.
First, we observe that we do not and cannot live and
experience in either a one-
dimensional linear world nor in a two-dimensional infinitely
extended planar world.

 Omnidirectional means that a center of a movable sphere
of observation has
been established a priori by Universe for each individual
life's inescapably mobile
viewpoint; like shadows, these move everywhere silently
with people. These physical-
existence-environment surrounds of life events spontaneously
resolve into two classes:
<OL TYPE="1">
<LI> those events that are to pass <I>tangentially</I> by the
observer; and
<LI> those event entities other than self that are moving
<I>radially</I> either toward or
away from the observer.

 The tangentially passing energy events are always and
only moving in lines
that are at nearest moment perpendicular to the radii
of the observer, which means that the
multiplicity of his real events does not produce chaos:
it produces discretely
apprehendable experience increments, all of which can
be chartingly identified by angle
and frequency data therewith to permit predictable reinterpositioning
events and
environmental transformations .

 The observer's unfamiliarity with the phenomena he
is observing, the
multiplicity of items of interaction and their velocity
of transformations, and their
omniengulfing occurrences tend to dismay the observer's
hope of immediate or reasonable
comprehension. Therefore, observers are often induced
to discontinue their attempts at
technical comprehension of their experience, in a surrender
of the drive to comprehend.
This fills the potential comprehension void of the observer
with a sense of chaos, which
sensation he then subconsciously converts into a false
rationale by explaining to himself
that the environment is inherently chaotic, ergo, inherently
incomprehensible. Thus he
satisfies himself that he is being super-reasonably
"realistic" and that Universe is just
annoyingly disorderly<SUP>&#95;&#95;</SUP>ergo, frequently dismissible<SUP>&#95;&#95;</SUP>which
seemingly warrants his
invention of whatever kind of make-believe Universe
seems momentarily most satisfying
to him.

 The more humanity probes and verifies experimentally
by reducing its
theories to demonstrable practice in order to learn
whether or not the theories are valid,
the more clearly does Universe reveal itself as being
generated and regenerated only upon
a complex of entirely orderly relationships. The inherent
spherical center viewpoint with
which each individual is endowed generates its own orderly
radii of observation in a closed
finite system of event observations that are subject
to orderly angular subdividing,
recording, and interrelating in spherical trigonometric
computational relationship to the
observer's inherently orderly sphere of reference.

 The expression "frame" of reference is not only "square"
as imputed by the
two-dimensional language of youth, but also by its exclusive
three-dimensional axes of
reference. Such XYZ coordinates impose inept, exclusively
rectilinear definings, which are
uncharacteristic of the omniwavilinear orbiting Universe
reality. Science has not found any
continuous surfaces, solids, straight lines, or infinitely
extensible, nonclosed-system planes.
The only infinity humanity has discovered experimentally
is that of the whole-fraction
subdivisibility of wholes into parts, as for instance
by the progressive halvings that divide
the finitely closed circle into ever smaller, central-angle-expressed,
arc increments. The
spherical dimensions of tangent and angle frequencied
intervals can always be
searchlighted "right on" all actual event tracery.

 Because spherical trigonometry sounded so formidable,
it was omitted from
primary education. Humans preferred to rationalize their
observed experience exclusively
in terms of nonexistent straight lines and planes, and
thus they evolved illogical linear and
square models of Universe such as the four corners of
the wide, wide world with its
nonexistent fixed <I>up</I> and <I>down</I> coordinates. Employment
of the "square" XYZ coordinate
frame of mensural reference in all present scientific
exploration is similar to going to
Washington from Boston only via Chicago because that
pattern conformed to the
scientists' only right-angled-expressibility of relationships.
Of course, if you know
calculus, you could evolve a curve plotted on the XYZ
gridding which may shorten your
course; but if you don't know calculus, you have to
go via Chicago.

 Since the myriads of eccentricities of cyclic periodicities

Universe inherently
defy any "fixed" overall frame of cosmic motion referencing;

gravity means that no so-called

 Within the total cosmic complexity the directions taken
by each and all of the
moving bodies are always the paths of least resistance.
Because the paths are those of least
resistance, all events of all transforming and traveling
entities require the least energy to
accomplish their complex action programmed passages<SUP>&#95;&#95;</SUP>ergo,
their accomplished
curvilinear courses are always the most economical lines
of travel. These most economical
routes of travel are known as geodesic lines. Geodesics
are not only nature's most
economical lines of interrelationship travel, but ipso
facto they are also nature's shortest-
time-of-travel lines.

 When using string to secure the cover on a cubical
box whose edges are two
feet long, people spontaneously surround the box in
a direction perpendicular to the
cube's edges and, having run the string completely around
the cubical box in one
direction, they do so again in a plane at right angle
to the first wind-around. This takes 16
feet of string and a pair of mid-top and mid-bottoms
knots to securely bind-in all six faces
of the cube. However, all six faces can be surrounded
and the cover held secure almost
twice as economically by using only one string eight-and-one-half-feet
long and following
the geodesic line that winds around the corners of the
cube from midedge to adjacent mid-
edge to produce an equiedged hexagon whose length of
line-of-string-reach-around is the
shortest distance around all six faces of a cube, wherefore
the string cannot slide off the
cube. To make this most economical path dynamically
evident, hold a cube between the
index fingers of your left and right hands with the
left index finger pressed against one top
corner of the cube and your right index finger pressed
against the corner of the bottom of
the cube most diagonally opposite the first corner pressed.
Now, holding the box firmly
between the two index fingers and stretching your arms
in front of you with your fingers
at the same level above the floor, ask someone to spin
the box around the axis between
your two fingers; as they do so, you will see the top
and bottom profile of the spinning
box and its six free corners rotating in two pairs of
three each to produce two hills in the
top and bottom profiles of the revolving box with a
valley between them running around
the box's equator of spinning. Along the bottom-most
valley runs the hexagonally wound
eight-and-one-half-feet-long string in its geodesic
valley of least distance around all six
faces.

where he thinks the
bird will be by the time the bullet can travel that

 The misconception of a "straight" line and its popular

humanity's education system as constituting the "shortest

 Such self-deceiving misinterpretations of experiences
have been introduced
by education into human sensing and traditional reasoning
only because of humanity's
microstature and microlongevity in respect to the terrestrial
environment and geological
time. Individual humans have also been overwhelmed by
the momentum of tradition, the
persuasions of "common sense," and a general fear of
questioning long-established and
ultimately power-backed authority and tradition. Thus
has innocent humanity been
misinformed or underinformed by the spoken-word-relayed
inventory of only popularly
explained, naked-eye impressions of local environment
experiences as they have occurred
throughout millions of years prior to humanity's discovery
and development of
instrumentally accommodated, macroscoped and microscoped
exploration of our
comprehensive environment. The experientially obtained,
macro-micro, instrumentally
measured data found no evidence of the existence of
dimensionless "points," "lines," and
"planes," nor of dimensioned "solids," nor of any "thing,"
nor of any noun-designatable,
thing-substantiated, static entities. The experiments
of human scientists have disclosed
only verb-describable events<SUP>&#95;&#95;</SUP>four-dimensionally coordinate
behaviors of complexedly
and ceaselessly intertransforming events, wavilinear
event trajectories, interferences, and
resonant event fields.

 Omnidirectional invokes a nucleus. Omnidirectional
consideration as
generalized conceptual pattern integrity requires an
inherently regenerative nucleus of
conceptual observation reference. Because of omni-closest-packing
of 12 spheres
triangularly surrounding one, inwardly-outwardly precessed
pulsations cannot distribute
energy further inwardly than the nuclear sphere's prime
volume, ergo nucleus-free, and
only geometrically approximatable center of volume;

 Precession has been thought of only as an angularly
reoriented, single-plane
resultant of orbiting forces, as expounded, for instance,
in the author's 1940 article on the
gyroscope (see footnote at Sec.
 <A HREF="p0810.html#1009.60">1009.60</A>
). Sun's planets
are precessed to orbit in a plane
generated at 90 degrees to the axis of its poles. In
synergetics, we discover
omnidirectional precession as in tensegrity geodesic
spheres. When we push inwardly on
any two diametrically opposite points of a tensegrity
geodesic sphere, the whole sphere
contracts symmetrically; when we pull outwardly from
one another on any two
diametrically opposite and islanded compression members
of a geodesic tensegrity sphere,
the whole sphere is precessionally and symmetrically
expanded. Precession is not an
exclusively single-plane, 90-degree reorientation, for
it also operates omnidirectionally, as
do all electromagnetic wave phenomena, which can, however,
be reflectively concentrated
and unidirectionally beamed. The fact that waves can
be reflectively and refractively
focused does not alter the fact that they are inherently
omnidirectional.

 Pushing on one individual pole of a tensegrity geodesic
sphere is the same as
pushing on two poles, because you only have to push
at one point for the inertia of the
system to react against your pushing. This point produces
a spherical wave set that if
uninterfered with, will travel encirclingly around the
sphere from any one starting point to
its 180-degree antipodes. It is like dropping a pebble
into the water: the crest is the
expanded phase of Universe, and the trough is the contracted
phase of Universe. Looking
at the ripples, we see that they are the locally initiated
expanding-contracting of whole
Universe as a consequence of local energy-event inputs.
This is why tensegrity and
pneumatic balls bounce. Contracting as they contact,
their equally violent expansion
impels them away from the<SUP>&#95;&#95;</SUP>relative to them<SUP>&#95;&#95;</SUP>inert body
of contact.

 <B>Volume and Area Progressions:</B> Omnidirectional precession
involves both
volumetric progressions and areal progressions that
are interaccommodative as radial
(volumetric) precessions and circumferential (surface)
precessions resulting per given unit
of energy input into the system. The ratios of these
concentric progressions are illustrated
at Figs. <A HREF="p0000.html#1005.15">1005.15A-D</A>.
