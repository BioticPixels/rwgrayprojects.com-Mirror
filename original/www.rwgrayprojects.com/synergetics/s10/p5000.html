 <B>Synergy of Synergies:</B> We have the concept of synergy
of synergies.
Precession is not predicted by mass attraction. Chemical
compounds are not prophesied by
the atoms. Biological protoplasm is not predicted by
the chemical compounds. The design
of the elephant or the tree and their unwitting essential
respiratory-gas conversion
interexchanging is not predicted by the protoplasm.
There is nothing about an elephant
that predicts islanded star galaxies. As we get into
larger and larger systems, the total
system is never predicted by its lesser system's components.

dictates both a species and within it an individual

either an elephant, pine tree, or

 DNA-RNA angle- and frequency-modulated designs are
composed
exclusively of four unique chemical constituents that
operate as guanine and cytosine; and
as thymine and adenine: inseparable but reversible tandem
pairs. The first pair occur as GC
or CG. The second pair occur as TA or AT. The DNA-RNA
codes may be read in any
sequence of those constituents, for instance, as CG
- CG - CG - GC - TA - AT - GC - TA -
TA - TA - AT CG - CG - GC, etc. (See Sec.

 We know the codes, but we do not know the "how come"
of their producing
an elephant. The complementarity of the holisticness
of these special-case individuals
balances out. An elephant does walk. Elephants are successful
designs. We have no
evidence of biological species that are inherently incomplete
designs. In the hierarchy of
hierarchies of synergies, Universe is the unpredicted
behavior of any of its sublevel
synergetics. We must start our synergetic analysis at
the level of Universe and thereafter
with [he known behavior of the greatest whole and the
known behavior of some of its
parts, then proceed as permitted mathematically to discover
its unknown parts. We have
the Greek triangle with its known 180 degrees of angle;
which together with the
knowledge of the magnitude of any two sides and their
included angle, or of any two
angles and their included side, etc., permit us to discover
the magnitude of the balance of
the triangle's six parts. Or, using trigonometry, if
we know the magnitude of any two
parts, we can ferret out the others.

 <B>Trigonometry:</B> The way we were taught in school about
fractions leads to
inconsistency. We were taught that fractions can be
multiplied, divided, added, and
subtracted only when the fractions consisted of identical
entities. We could not divide
three elephants by four oranges. However, trigonometry
introduced functions<SUP>&#95;&#95;</SUP>which are
fractions or ratios, e.g., the sine, cosine, tangent,
cotangent, and so forth. Contradicting
our earlier lessons about fractions, these trigonometric
fractions do mix together angles
and edges of spherical triangles. This inconsistency
could have been avoided by starting
our geometry with spherical trigonometry. We would recognize
that what we call a great
circle arc or "edge" is indeed a central angle of the
sphere. We would learn that we have
central and external angles. We would spontaneously
see that plane geometry derived
from solid geometry and is an oversimplification of
localized and superficial aspects of
systems. This brings us back to angle and frequency
modulation, i.e., outward, inward,
and circumferentially around, complementary angle and
frequency oscillations and
pulsations and the congruence of the linear and angular
frequency modulations. By
teaching children plane geometry before teaching them
spherical trigonometry, society
became harnessed with a mathematical contradiction wherein
trigonometry deliberately
ratioed edge <I>lines</I> with <I>angles</I><SUP>&#95;&#95;</SUP>which clearly seemed
to be forbidden by arithmetical
fractions' law. Single lines are seemingly very different
from angles, because angles
involve <I>two</I> (convergent) <I>lines.</I> If, however, instead
of starting elementary education with
unrealistic, linear, one-dimensional arithmetic; and
then going on to two-dimensional plane
geometry; and thence to three-dimensional cubes; and
thence to spherical trigonometry ...
if we instead start synergetically with whole systems
such as spherical trigonometry, we
altogether avoid the concept of an edge and instead
learn that the arc-defined edges of
spherical triangles are the central angles of the sphere;
wherefore both the arc edges and
corners are angles, ergo ratioable. Now, having both
surface <I>angles</I> and central <I>angles,</I> we
discover that spherical trigonometry is always dealing
with whole tetrahedra whose
interior apexes are always at the center of the spherical
system; and three of whose
triangular faces are the great-circle plane triangles
hidden within the spheric system; and
whose fourth triangular face is always the arc-chord
surface triangle of the sphere. These
central- and surface-angle understandings are fundamental
to transformational thinking,
which deals with the falling-inward and precessing-outward
proclivities.

The V is visual.
The V is a specifically visible angle. The angle is
an angle independent of the length of the
fingers<SUP>&#95;&#95;</SUP>that is, independent of the length of the sides

tetrahedra are conceptual pattern integrities independent

Likewise, triangles are always and

of 720 degrees) of angles
surrounding all the external vertexes describing those

it is necessary to know<SUP>&#95;&#95;</SUP>in addition to

values <I>of any other two</I> of
the to-be-solved triangle's five other parts: A, B,

 <B>Central and External Angles of Systems:</B> The tetrahedral
integrity of
internal (central) angles and external (surface) angles
of systems permits the integration of
the topological and quantum hierarchies. It is exciting
that the three internal radii give us
three edges of the tetrahedron's six edges; while the
arc chords give us the three other of
the tetrahedron's six relationships; and the center
of the spheric system and the surface
triangle's three corner-vertexes give us the four-vertex-events
having the inherent six
system relationships; which six are our coincidentally
six-positive, six-negative,
equieconomical vectorial freedoms (see Sec.
 <A HREF="../s05/p3700.html#537.10">537.10</A>).
The central angles gives us what we
call the chords of the central-angle arcs. Thus all-system-embracing
geodesic lines are
expressible in angular fractions of whole circles or
cycles.

 <B>Angular Functionings of Radiation and Gravity:</B> The
differences
between the central angles' and surface angles' functionings
are identifiable with
radiational and gravitational functionings. Radiation
identifies with central angles.
Radiation is outwardly divergent. Gravity identifies
with the three surface angles'
convergent closure into the surface triangle's finite
perimeter. Gravity is omniembracing
and is not focusable. Gravity is Universe-conservingly
effective in its circumferential
coherence.

 <B>Leverage:</B> The principle of leverage is employed in
shears, nutcrackers, and
pliers. The longer the lever arms, the more powerful
the pressure applied between the
internal central angles of the nutcracker's lever arms.
We can make an illuminating model
of our planet Earth if we think of it as a spherical
bundle of nutcrackers with all their
fulcrums at the center of the sphere and all the radii
of the sphere acting as the lever arms
of the pincers. The whole bunch of pincers have a common
universal fulcrum at the
common center. The farther out we go on the radial lever
arms, the less effort is required
to squeeze the ends together to exert nutcracking pressure
at the center. If we go around
the sphere-embracing circumference progressively tying
up the ends of the levers together,
we find that it takes very little, local, surface effort
tensively between any two surface
points to build up excruciatingly powerful, central-compression
conditions. The bigger the
model, the easier it is to tie it up; ever more delicate
an exterior web will hold it together.

 Identifying the surface-angle chordings with gravity,
we comprehend why it
is that as we get deeper and deeper within our Earth,
with the pressure continually
increasing as we get deeper, we see that the increasing
gravitational-compression effect is
due to the circumferential containment. The external
containment web is always getting
hold of the outermost ends of the centrally pinching
levers. With this leverage effect, the
farther out you go, the more advantage you have and
the more powerful work you can do
with that lever. Leverage effectiveness increases toward
the center, ergo the increasing
pressure that we identify with gravity. But it has this
circumferential aspect.

 There is a tendency to misinterpret the increasing
pressures occurring
inwardly of Earth as "deadweight," i.e., only as a radiationally-inward
force, but it must be
realized that the "weight" is omnidirectional compression.
The gravitational intermass-
attraction is progressively augmented, as we go radially
outward, by the circumferential
mass-interattraction of the relative abundance of elemental
atoms, which increases at the
second-power rate of the radial-distance outwardly from
the Earth's center; and as the
pressures bring about ever closer presence of the atoms
to one another, there is also an
additional second-power exponential gain which results
in r<SUP>2</SUP> varying as <I>proximity</I><SUP>2</SUP> = P<SUP>4</SUP>,
where P = relative compressive force. The surface chordal-angle
magnitudes multiplied by
radius to the second power produce the relative magnitude
of network leverage-advantage
resulting in the relative increase in pressure as you
go inward toward Earth's center. This
is exciting because we now comprehend that gravity is
a circumferentially operative force
and not a radial force, with precession bringing about
the 90-degreeness.

 Remembering Newton's law of gravity, wherein the relative
interattractions
are directly proportional to the product of the masses
increased by the second power of
the distances between the respective mass centers, we
realize that doubling the size of a
sphere brings about an eightfold multiplication of the
circumferential mass-interattraction.
In effect, we have a network of chordal cables tensively
intertriangulating the
progressively outmost ends of the spherical nutcracker
bundle with circumferential
turnbuckles continually tightening the surface-triangulated
tensional embracement
network. This means that the pressures being exerted
internally are proportional to the
fourth power of the relative radial depth inward of
Earth's surface.

 <B>Second-Power Congruence of Gravitational and Radiational
Constants:</B>
The relative mass-energy content magnitude of a polyhedral
system is arrived at by
multiplying the primitive, frequency-zero, a-priori-state
volume (relative to the
tetrahedron-equals-one) of the geometric, concentric,
structural system's hierarchy, by the
second power of the (both minimum and maximum) limit
linear velocity of all classes of
radiation when unfettered in a vacuum; i.e., multiplying
initial volume by the terminal rate
at which a spherical wave's outermost, unique-event-distinguishability
progressively and
omniexpansively occurs, as expressed in terms of the
second power of relative frequency
of modular subdivision of its initially-occurring, polyhedral
system's radius; ergo as
manifest in Einstein's equation E = Mc<SUP>2</SUP>. Energy equals
a given mass with its relative
mass-energy compactedness tighteningly modified by the
velocity of energy-as-radiation
intertransformability potential (not just linearly,
but omnidirectionally); ergo as a
potentially ever-expansively enlarging spherical wave's
outermost-event, one-radial-
wavelength-deep surface; ergo second power of system
frequency (because wave surfaces
grow omni-outwardly as of the second power of the radial,
linear frequency) rate of gain.

 <B>Spherical Field:</B> As already discovered (see Sec.

physics' discovery of
universally-multifrequenced, periodic-event-discontinuity
<I>outness</I> (in complementation to
equally frequenced, event-occurrence <I>in-ness</I>) is inherent
in the always-experientially-
verifiable, wave-duration frequency, photon-quantum
phenomena; wherefore synergetics
had to redefine both volumes and surfaces in terms of
<I>dense</I> (high-frequency) aggregates
of only pointally-positionable, energy events' geometrical
formulations, with spherical
"surfaces" being in operational reality a dense, outermost,
single-photon-thick, "cloud"
layer, everywhere approximately equidistant in all directions
from one approximately-
locatable event center. For this reason the second-power
exponential rate of area gain is
not to be identified with a continuum, i.e., with a
continuous system, but only with the
high-frequency outermost layer population aggregate
of energy-event points. With
numbers of photons and wave frequency per primitive
volume, the relative concentration
of given masses are determinable.

 Isaac Newton discovered the celestial gravitation interrelationship
and
expressed it in terms of the second power of the relative
distance between the different
masses as determined by reference to the radius of one
of the interattracted masses. The
gravitational relationship is also synergetically statable
in terms of the second power of
relative frequency of volumetric quanta concentrations
of the respectively interattracted
masses. Newton's gravitational constant is a radially
(frequency) measured rate of
spherical surface contraction, while Einstein's radiational
constant is a radial (frequency)
rate of spherical expansion. (See Secs.

to pondering, in surprise, over the
fact that the vector equilibrium, which identifies the
gravitational behaviors, discloses 25
great circles for the vector equilibrium in respect
to its 24 external vector edges, and the
icosahedron, which identifies the electron behaviors
of electromagnetics, discloses 31
great circles in respect to its 30 external vector edges.

 In each case, there is an excess of one great circle
over the edge vectors.
Recalling that the vector edges of the vector equilibrium
exactly equal the radial explosive
forces, while the icosahedron's 30 external edges are
longer and more powerful than its 30
radial vectors, yet each has an excess of one great
circle, which great circles must have
two polar axes of spin, we encounter once more the <I>excess
two</I> polar vertexes

the excess of embracingly cohering
forces in contradistinction to the explosively disintegrative

 <B>Possibility of Rational Prime Numbers in High-energy

physicists, notably at the European

bonding and radioactive effects of the atomic nucleus
(see Sec.

definition of a Unified Field Theory becomes tantalizingly
nearer at hand. The results and
findings of the physicists' experiments should be examined
in the light of synergetics'
models, especially the vector equilibrium, and the comprehensive
isotropicity which
derives from closest-sphere-packing and provides omnirational
accounting for radial and
circumferential coordination. This kind of examination
might account for some of the
energetic behaviors of the newly described mass particles<SUP>&#95;&#95;</SUP>leptons
and hadrons, quarks

 <B>Vector Equilibrium and Icosahedron: Ratio of Gravitational
and
Electromagnetic Constants:</B> The vector equilibrium and
the icosahedron are the same
initial twentyness. But the icosahedron is always in
either a positive limit or a negative
limit phase of its, only-pulsatingly attained, first-degree
structural self-stabilization in the
asymmetric transformation of the vector equilibrium,
which alternating pulsations are
propagated by the eternally opposed, radiant-attractive,
always dualistic, inter-self-
transformable potential of ideally conceptual unity
of Universe.

 The icosahedral phase of self-structuring is identifiable
uniquely with the
electron, whose mass relationship to the proton is as
1:18.51, whereas the icosahedron's
volume is to the vector equilibrium's volume as 20:18.51.
In this connection it is
significant that the vector equilibrium's plural unity
is 20, ergo we may say the relationship
is as unity: 18.51.

 Reminiscent of electron proclivities, the icosahedron
displays the same
surface number of spherically conformed, energy-event
packages and its only-one-
wavelength-deep, single, outer sphere layer array is
omnitriangulated, while the vector
equilibrium's surface is arrayed two-fifths in triangulation
and three-fifths in open,
unstable, square tangency. As spherical agglomerates
decrease in radius<SUP>&#95;&#95;</SUP>as do the vector
equilibria's contract to the icosahedral phase<SUP>&#95;&#95;</SUP>their
sphere centers approach one another,
and Newton's mass-interattraction law, which shows a
second-power gain as the
interproximities are halved, imposes an intercoherence
condition whereby as their overall
system radius decreases, their circumferential mass-interattractions
increase exponentially
as r<SUP>2</SUP>, where r = radius of the system. (See Sec.

 <B>Meshing and Nonmeshing:</B> We know from the scientifically
proven
knowledge derived from physical experiments that local
physical systems are continually
losing energy, though they may be concurrently importing
or inhibiting energies. This
constant energy loss is the dominant characteristic
of entropy. Due to each of the local
Universe system's unique complex of chemical-element
periodicities the energies that are
given off in an orderly manner appear to be disorderly
harmonics in respect to the unique
harmonic complexes released by other systems. The timings
between different energies
leaving different systems, like any two different-sized
mechanical gears, may not
necessarily mesh or synchronize with the timings of
energies leaving other systems that
they encounter, which encountered energy events also
may be separately orderly in
themselves.

 The special-case regenerative system itself may attain
maximum orderliness
while being acted upon by externally distributive forces.
Often the reason that systems do
not synchronize is that they derive from different complexes
of chemical elements. Since
every one of the interorbiting cosmic system's elements
has its unique frequencies, the
wave frequencies of the orbiting systems are like the
peaks and valleys of gear teeth whose
peak-and-valley perimeters have latch-key-like irregularities.
We have gears that rarely
interlock and must consequently remain only superficially
tangent to one another. Hence
they take up more room than they would if they had meshed.
The centers of the two
meshing gears are nearer to one another than are the
centers of the same two gears when
their teethed perimeters are not meshed. When meshed,
they are more powerfully
intermass-attracted than when nonmeshed. (See Secs.

 Gears of equal weight and of the same material might
have very many little
teeth or relatively few big teeth in each of their great-circle
cycles. The frequencies being
given off entropically do not expand in planes or lines;
they expand omnidirectionally as a
complex of differently timed radial spirals. As the
omnispheric gears fail to mesh, they
employ ever more space, and therefore we realize a physically
entropic Universe that is
everywhere locally broadcasting its disorderly information
to our sensorial receptors. Thus
it seems<SUP>&#95;&#95;</SUP>to short-term, local observation<SUP>&#95;&#95;</SUP>that the aggregate
discards of entropically
released energies of the various localities of the physical
Universe are expanding and even
further expending energies in an increasingly disorderly
manner. The syntropic births and
growths escape our attention, for they inherently withhold
or withdraw information
regarding their ultimately syntropic cosmic resolution
of apparent disorders<SUP>&#95;&#95;</SUP>a resolution
withheld from Earthian observers who are preoccupied
with hindsight and dismayed by the
obvious only-initially-entropic disorders. But fundamental
complementarity requires that
there be other localities and phases of Universe wherein
the Universe is reconvening,
collecting, and condensively contracting in an increasingly
orderly manner as
complementary regenerative conservation phases of Universe
thus manifesting
comprehensive transitions from disorder to order, from
entropy to syntropy.

 Entropy is decadent, putrid, repulsive, disassociative,
explosive, dispersive,
maximally disordering, and ultimately expansive. Syntropy
is impulsive, associative,
implosive, collective, maximally ordering, and ultimately
compactive. Entropy and
syntropy intertransform pulsively like the single rubber
glove (see Sec.
 <A HREF="../s05/p0600.html#507.00">507</A>). There is an
entropic, self-negating, momentary self: there is also
the no-time, nondimensionable
eternity of mind. Dimensioning is apprehensible only
within temporal relativity. Time is
experienced in our relative duration lags and gestation
rates as well as in the unique
frequency interrelatedness of the electromagnetic spectrum
events and novents. Every time
we experience the novent disconnects of momentary annihilation
into eternity, naught is
lost. Mind deals only with eternity<SUP>&#95;&#95;</SUP>with eternal principles.
What is gained to offset any
loss is the residual, observational lags in accuracy
inherent and operative as cognition and
the relativity of awareness that we call life. (See
Secs.

interplayed with the absolute "if-this-then-that" integrity

 <B>Pattern Sorting and Observing:</B> When we are able to
observe for long
enough periods of time, however, we find all the gears
of Universe eventually meshing,
though not simultaneously. The next periodic meshing
of any two of the gears might take
a thousand years<SUP>&#95;&#95;</SUP>or 28 l/2 years<SUP>&#95;&#95;</SUP>or 17 seconds. The
important phenomenon to note is
that there are great varieties of periods of nonmeshing
which altogether make the
physically observed totality appear to take up ever
more room, and anywhere within this
expansiveness the locally predominant events occurring
within short spans of time appear
to be omnidisorderly. When we compound that realization
with the now-known
millionfold greater span of electromagnetic reality
and the lesser span of direct-sense
ranging of the human organism, we begin to comprehend
how readily humanity falls into
the trap of dismay, fear, and negativism in general.
Impatience engenders further
myopically disorderly incrementation of information
receipts. Those who are impatient for
the receipt of the next news broadcasts are only beguiled
by negative information. That is
what myopia looks for. Chronic shortsightedness spontaneously
seeks and tunes in only
the broadcast entropy. Syntropy incasts, in contradistinction
to entropic broadcast.
Syntropy can be apprehended only through <I>overall</I> or
comprehensive review of the totally
recalled information of long-term experience.

 Man has no experimental data to suggest that energy
is ever created or
destroyed. Though our own overall experience leads us
to the discovery of cyclic events
that return upon themselves, the local, momentary, physical
events seem to be giving off
energy and taking up more room despite our own syntropic
attempts to reestablish local
order. Entropy is defined as the law of increase of
the random element. But our experience
in physical exploration also reveals to us that every
pattern phenomenon has its
complementary which is rarely a mirror-image and is
most frequently invisible. As the
complementary has the effect of cosmic integrity balancing,
we realize there must be
unseen syntropic events of Universe that are always
reordering the environment. Syntropy
is the law of elsewhere-importing and always-orderly
regrouping of the entropic
exportings of all dying systems. Aging and death here
engender birth and growth
elsewhere. (See Sec.
