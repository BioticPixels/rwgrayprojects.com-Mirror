 In the closest packing of omnitriangulated geodesic
spheres, the closest the
spheres can come to each other is as triangular face-bonding,
which is of course triple-
bonded, or trivalent. In such cohering tangency, the
closest-packed geodesic "spherical"
polyhedra would constitute crystalline arrangements
and would take up the least amount
of space, because the midfaces are radially closer to
the center of the sphere than are the
midedges (midchords) of the omnifaceted "spheric" polyhedra,
while the vertexes are at
greatest radius.

 Taking up a little more room would be closest packing
of geodesic spheres
by edge-bonding, which is double-bonded, or bivalent.
Bivalently tangential spherical

 <B>Interference: You Really Can't Get There from Here:</B>
Omnitopology
recognizes the experimentally demonstrable fact that
two energy-event traceries (lines)
cannot pass through the same point at the same time.
It follows that no event vectors of
Universe ever pass through any of the same points at
the same time. Wherefore, it is also
operationally evidenced that the conceptual-system geometries
of omnitopology are
defined only by the system withinness and withoutness
differentiating a plurality of loci
occurring approximately midway between the most intimate
proximity moments of the
respectively convergent-divergent wavilinear vectors,
orbits, and spin equators of the
system. (See Sec.
 <A HREF="../s05/p1500.html#517.00">517</A>,
 "Interference.") The best you
can do is to get almost there; this is
evidenced by physical discontinuity. Zeno's paradox
thus loses its paradoxical aspects.

 <B>Magnitude of Independent Orbiting:</B> Most impressively
illustrative of
what this means is evidenced by the mass-attractively
occasioned falling in toward Earth
of all relatively small objects traveling around Sun
at the same rate as Earth, Earth itself
being only an aggregate of all the atoms that are cotravelers
around Sun at the same
velocity, while each atom's nucleus is only one-ten-thousandth
the diameter of its outer
electron shell. There is as much space between the atom's
nucleus and its electron-orbit-
produced shell as proportionately exists between Sun
and its planet Pluto.

 The tendency to fall in to Earth or any other celestial
body will be reduced as
a cotraveling object increases its distance away from
Earth or any other relatively large
body as a consequence of its being given acceleration
into orbital speed greater than
Earth's Sun-orbiting speed. In 99.9999999999 percent
of Universe no body tends to fall in
to any other; 99.999999 &#215; 10<SUP>30</SUP> of all known Universe

 <B>Symmetrical Conformation of Flying-Star Teams:</B> We have
terms such as
"boundary layer" that have to be recognized in hard
technology where we find that despite
the accurate machining to fine tolerance of such things
as steel bearings, there is always a
dimensional aberration that is unaccounted for in man's
eyes but, when measured
instrumentally in nuclear-diameter magnitudes, is as
relatively great as that between the
stars of the Milky Way. Men think superficially only
of lubricants and mechanically-fitting-
bearings tolerances whereas<SUP>&#95;&#95;</SUP>focused at the proper magnitude
of conceptuality<SUP>&#95;&#95;</SUP>what
goes on in the affairs of lubricants and bearings discloses
discrete geometrical relationships
where no event ever makes absolute contact with another.
There are simply orbital
interferences, where the mass attractions will always
be just a little more powerful than the
fundamental disintegrative tendencies.

 The relative frequency timing of orbits is such that
as one complex energy
event (a body) approaches critical proximity between
any two other equal mass bodies to
that of the intruder, the group mass interattraction
fourfolds. We get to a condition where
the approaching body is suspended between two others
like landing on an invisible
trampoline. Similarly, in manmade machinery as the teeth
of gears enter into the matching
gears' valleys, the mass-attraction forces finally provide
an invisible suspension field
whereby none of the atoms ever touches another. (See

 When metallic alloys are produced, we have such conditions,
for instance, as
four symmetrically orbiting stars producing a tetrahedral
flying formation, each trying to
orbit away from the other but inter-mass-attractively
cohered. When this flying team of
four stars in tetrahedral conformation joins together
with a second team of four stars in
tetrahedral conformation, they take position symmetrically
with each member star of the
two sets of four becoming congruent with the eight corners
of a cube.

 Now each of the stars in the flying teams has nearer
neighbors than it had
before, and this mass interattractiveness is multiplied
as the second power of relative
proximity. Their initial acceleration of 186,000 miles
per second keeps their orbits always
intact. Each of the flying formations is made up of
other flying teams of atoms with a
central commander nucleus and a fleet of electrons buzzing
around it at 186,000 miles per
second; being interfrequenced, the four nucleated team
members synchronously interact as
the orbits of their electrons in closest proximity are
intervally geared in second-power
accelerations of intertenuousness, producing an omnicoordinate
condition akin to the mid-
gear-tooth trampoline (an invisible muscular field).

 Next, a six-member flying team (octahedron) heaves
into critical proximity
with the original two teams now flying a group formation
in the form of the eight comer
positions of the cube. The acceleration stability of
each of the flying teams is such that
they join with the new six-star team taking symmetrical
positions in the middle of the six
square faces of the eight-star-team cube. The mass interattraction
of the 14 now becomes
vastly greater, and the electron-orbit-gear-trampolines
of each of the 14 nuclear-flow
spherical ships are now in very much greater second-power
increase of interattractiveness.

 This cubical flying team of 14 ships now sights another
flying team of 12
ships, and the team of 14 and the team of 12 are flown
into group formation with the 12
ships taking station at the midpoints of the 12 edges
of the 14-star-team cube. Thus the
mass attraction is ever more vastly increased, yet the
integrity of their interpositioning and
their non-falling-into-one-anotherness is guaranteed
by the centrifugal forces of the
orbiting superbly balanced by the second-power increase
of the gravitational buildup
already noted.

 Thus are planets cohered, and thus are metallic alloys
on planets even more
powerfully cohered<SUP>&#95;&#95;</SUP>all within the rules of never-quite-touching;
all within the rules of
interval; all within the rules of no actual particulate
"solids." They may fly wavilinear
patterns, but the atoms are found to be as discontinuous
as the wavilinear sky trails of the
jet airplane. While physics is as yet formally puzzling
over the paradox of the wave and the
particle, the apparent contradiction is occasioned only
by the superficial misconception of
a particle where none exists. We deal only with events
in pure principle. The sense of
physical, textural reality, of awareness itself, which
uniquely identifies life and time (in
contradistinction to eternal, weightless metaphysics),
is inherent to the plurality of
frequencies and degrees of freedom that in pure principle
theoretically provide different
interpositionings within given amounts of time. The
plurality of principles, which
themselves are interaccommodative, inherently generates
awareness differentiability. The
exquisite perfection of the total interaccommodation
and the limited local set of the
tunabilities of the terrestrial living organisms, such
as the human instrument vehicle, are all
permitted in the general complexity and permit local-focus,
limited awareness as
individual-seeming perceptivity. (See Sec.

 <B>Models and Divinity:</B> Because of indeterminism, the
exclusive tenuous
nature of integrity<SUP>&#95;&#95;</SUP>discontinuity<SUP>&#95;&#95;</SUP>means that no exact
hard particulate models may ever
be fashioned by man. The conscientious and competent
modelmaker undertaking to make
a beautiful tetrahedron suddenly becomes aware that
it is impossible to make a perfect
corner at a point. There is always both a terminal and
a radius and an askew convergence-
divergence at noncontacting critical proximity. When
he magnifies the edges which look
sharp to the naked eye, he sees they are never sharp.
The more powerful the magnification
he brings to bear on his work, the more he becomes aware
of the lumpy radii of the
micropatterning of the stuff with which he works. Finally,
the electron microscope tells
him that the point of a needle is a pile of oranges
and that the blade of the razor is a
randomly dumped breakwater of spherical rubble. When
further meticulously studied and
magnified, this superficial seeming randomness proves
to be our flying squadrons, earlier
described, enjoying a vast number of intricately orderly
team maneuvers but with never a
pilot in sight. The whole is flown by remote control
with fantastic feedback and local
automation, all governed by an eternally complex integrity
of complementary,
interaccommodative principles.

 Little man on little planet Earth evoking words to
describe his experiences,
intuiting ever and anon the greater integrity, struggles
to form a word to manifest his
awareness of the greater integrity. His lips can express,
his throat and lungs can produce,
in the limited atmosphere of planet Earth, he may make
a sound like g o d . . . which is
obviously inadequate to identify his inherent attunement
to eternal complex integrity. The
little humans on little Earth, overwhelmed these millions
of years with the power of the
bigger over the lesser (muscles), have spontaneously
identified the cosmic integrity with
the local terrestrial experience. The conditioned-reflex
feedbacks have introduced
enormous confusion of approximate identification, fusing
the local physical muscular
authority with the eternal complex integrity, whose
absolute generalizability can never be
locked into or described as a special case.

 The angular accelerations, however, manifest a vast
variety of radii. The
differentiation of physics into linear and angular occurred
when the humans involved failed
to realize that the diameter of the little circle is
always a small arc of a vastly greater circle
passing through it. The greater the radius, the slower
the total cyclic realization. There are
no straight lines or "linear infinities." Realization
of this is what Einstein spoke of as

 <B>Hammer-Thrower:</B> The effect of bodies in acceleration
upon other bodies
in acceleration is always precessional, and the resultant
is always at an angle other than 180
degrees. Even today, the physicists consider precession
to be only mathematically
treatable by quantum mechanics because they have failed
to realize that the complex
intereffects are conceptually comprehendible.<SUP>1</SUP>

 The model of the man fastening a weight to a string
and swinging it around
his head is the familiar one of the hammer-thrower.
With each accelerating cycle the object
swung around his head accumulates in its velocity the
progressive energy imports
metabolically exported through the action of the human's
muscles. (See Sec.
 <A HREF="../s08/p2600.html#826.03">826.03</A>
 for
description of the metabolic energy accumulation of
the hammer-thrower. ) Men have not
accurately interpreted their instinctively articulated
performance of slinging, hammer-
throwing, baseball pitching, and other angularly accelerated
hurlings. When a human picks
up a stone and throws it, he thinks of it as a different
kind of a sport from the hammer-
thrower's activity. But the only difference is that
with throwing the stone, his arm is the
rod of the hammer and instead of accumulating velocity
by many cycles of acceleration, he
operates through only one-third of a circle in which
he can accumulate a certain amount of
metabolic muscle energy to transform into acceleration.
Substituting the athlete's
"hammer" for the stone or baseball, the hammer-thrower
is able to build much more of his
metabolically generated energy into muscular acceleration,
which accumulates to produce
very great force. The baseball-throw and the hammer-throw
utilize the same principle,
except that the rate of accumulation is one-third cycle
for the former while it is a plurality
of cycles for the latter, thus permitting the introduction
of larger amounts of time-of-effort
application.

 A man with a weight on a string swings it above his
head and lets go of it,
but the man is in such close proximity to Earth that
the attraction of Earth takes over and
pulls the weight in toward Earth. This tends to misinform
the observer, who may lose sight
of the fact that the man and Earth and the weight on
the string are all going together
around Sun at 60,000 mph.

 Despite the overwhelming power of the attraction of
Earth, we must
continue to keep in mind the critical-proximity concept.
For instance, let us consider two
steel magnets lying on a table and apparently not attracting
one another simply because
Earth-pull against the table and the friction of the
table prevent them from indicating their
pull for one another. But as they are given a series
of pushes toward one another there
comes a point when Earth's gravity-induced friction
is overcome by the local magnetic
interattraction which increases as the second power
of the relative interdistance increase;
and there comes a moment when friction is overcome and
the two magnets start moving
toward one another and accelerate to a fast, final-snap
closure. It is when such other
forces are overcome that the two magnets articulate
their interattraction independent of all
other forces: this is the point we call critical proximity.

 The astronaut can go out space-walking because he and
his space vehicle are
in the same Universe orbit at the same rate, as would
be any other object the space-walker
had in his hand. Here is an opportunity for the mutual
mass attractions to articulate
themselves, except that in this situation, the prime
force is the acceleration itself. What the
physicists have failed to elucidate to society, and
possibly to themselves, as well, is that
<I>linear acceleration is also orbital</I> but constitutes
release from co-orbiting (or critical-
proximity orbiting) into the generalized orbiting of

 Comet: A comet is a celestial itinerant, a cosmic skyways
vacuum cleaner
trying to accommodate an aggregation of stardust as
it travels successively through the
orbital neighborhoods of planets, stars, and other comets.
The radiation pressures from the
nearest stars, however, tend to blow the vacuum cleaner's
stardust gleanings out into a
bagless "dustbag," causing what we erroneously speak
of as the comet's tail. These "tail"
displays should be spoken of as Sun-radiation blowout
trajectories. As comets come into
critical proximity of syntropically importing planets,
the stardust aggregates of their
inverted "tails" are gravitationally depleted by the
planets they pass, as much of that
stardust is attracted into the planets or moons to become
part of those import centers'
syntropic buildup in a multibillions-of-years syntropic
preparation of their stored-energy
aggregates to be converted into the state of an entropically
exporting star.

 As each human being discovers self and others and employs
more principles
more and more consciously to the advantage of others,
the more effectively does the
individual retain the integrity of his own unique orbiting
in Universe, local though it may
seem aboard our planet. His unique orbiting brings him
into a vast variety of critical-
proximity fall-ins. Man has progressively acquired enough
knowledge to raise his vision
from the horizontal to the vertical, to stay first atop
the watery ocean and next atop the
airocean heights, and most recently to orbit beyond
the biosphere with ever greater
independence, with ever greater competence, and with
ever greater familiarity with the

 Little individuals in orbit around little berry patches,
fruit trees, nut piles, and
fishing holes are instinctively programmed to pick up
rocks and pile up walls around the
patches, orchards, and gathering places. Some men floating
on the waters and blown by
the wind were challenged to respond to the accelerating
frequence of stress and high-
energy impacts, and they went into vastly longer orbital
voyages. Others went into lesser
and slower orbits on camels and horses, or even slower
orbits on their own legs. The
effect of human beings on other human beings is always
precessional. All of us orbit
around one another in ever greater acceleration, finally
going into greater orbits. The local
critical-proximity fall-in and its 99.9999 percent designed-in
programming becomes no
longer in critical-proximity evidence, while all the
time the apprehending and
comprehending of the generalized principles elucidates
their eternal integrity in contrast to
the complex inscrutability of the local critical-proximity
aberrations permitted and effected
in pure principle whenever the frictional effect on
the two stones lying before us
overcomes their tendency to fall in to one another<SUP>&#95;&#95;</SUP>with
naught else in Universe but two
stones<SUP>&#95;&#95;</SUP>which statement in itself discloses our proclivity
for forgetting all the billions of
atoms involved in the two stones, and their great electron
orbits around their nuclei,
guaranteeing the omniacceleration, yet synergetically
and totally cohered by the mass-
interattractiveness, which is always more effective
(because of its finite closures) than any
of the centrifugal disintegrative effects of the acceleration.
All the interaberrations
imposed on all the orbits bring about all the wave-frequency
phenomena of our Universe.
The unique wave frequencies of the unique 92 chemical
elements are unique to the local
critical-proximity event frequency of the elemental
event patternings locally and
precessionally regenerated. Finally, we must recall
that what man has been calling "linear"
is simply <I>big orbit arc</I> seemingly attained by escaping
at 90 degrees from local orbit.
There are only two kinds of acceleration, greater and
lesser, with the lesser being like the
radius of the nucleus of an atom in respect to the diameter
of its electron shell.

 Humanity at this present moment is breaking the critical-proximity
barrier
that has programmed him to operate almost entirely as
a part of the ecological organisms
growing within the planet Earth's biosphere. His visit
to Moon is only symptomatic of his
total, local, social breakout from a land-possessing,
fearful barnacle into a world-around-
swimming salmon. Some have reached deep-water fish state,
some have become world-
around-migrating birds, and some have gone out beyond
the biosphere. Long ago, man's
mind went into orbit to understand a little about the
stars. And little man on little Earth
has now accumulated in the light emanating from all
the stars a cosmic inventory of the
relative abundance of each of the 92 regenerative chemical
elements present in our thus-
far-discovered billion galaxies of approximately a hundred
billion stars each,
omnidirectionally observed around us at a radius of
11 billion light years. Man can always
go into infinitely great, eternal orbit. Mind always
has and always will.

 When we see the pea-shooter blowing peas out in a trajectory,
we see that if
it is blown harder, the impelled peas may attain a longer
trajectory before they curve down
and toward Earth as they yield to gravity. Assuming
no wind, the gradual curvature from
approximately horizontal to vertical of the peas' trajectory
all occurs in the same single
vertical plane. When you insert your finger into the
blown pea's trajectory, you interfere
with the pea and deflect it angularly. This means deflecting
the plane with which the pea's
horizontal course is translated toward the vertical
from below, or sideways, or from any
direction. This trajectory altering is a phenomenon
described by the physicists as angular
deflection.

When we come back to the spinning Olympic hammer-thrower
this time rotating vertically
between head-and-foot-clamped ball-bearing turntables
which in turn are mounted in
gimbaled rings, to whose belt is hooked a complete,
360-degree, ball-to-ball, "grass-skirt-
like" ring of horizontally revolving steel balls on
the outer ends of steel rods, on the inner
ends of which are pairs of triangular steel handles
now hooked to the hammer-thrower's
belt after his successive angular acceleration of each
hammer into the horizontal spinning
ring of his "grass skirt." His separately accelerated
and horizontally traveling balls are each
similar to each of the peas as first blown horizontally
out of the pea-shooter tube. Both the
peas and the steel balls are being affected by two forces:
the peas by gravity pulling upon
them and by the force with which they were originally
propelled in horizontal trajectory;
the spinning steel balls have their original horizontal
acceleration, which was so great as to
overcome gravity's Earthward-pulling effect, plus their
second restraint, that of the steel
rods successfully restraining and countering the centrifugal
force that seeks to release the
balls into <I>tangential,</I> not radial trajectory.

heavy from the light<SUP>&#95;&#95;</SUP>such as milk centrifuges out of

thought of the expelling as radial rather than tangential.

horizontal plane at a point on the spun circle directly
in the line running between your eyes
and the target direction in which you wish the hammer
to travel, that is leading
perpendicularly outward from the circle in the direction
in which the released pellet
travels. The fact is that if it were released at that
point, it would travel at a direction 90
degrees, or sidewise from your desired trajectory, from
that actually realized. Studying the
action of an Olympic hammer-thrower, you will find that
the spherical hammer and its rod
are released at a point facing away 90 degrees from
the direction in which the released
hammer travels: i.e., the hammer always goes off tangentially
from the circle of
acceleration. This contradicts the popular conception

 We had learned earlier about fixed or progressive-horizontal
reangling of the
plane of the peas' coincidentally yielding to gravity
(Sec.
 <A HREF="p0810.html#1009.83">1009.83</A>), as we tried discrete
deflecting of the successive peas shot from the pea-shooter.
By experimenting, moving our
finger progressively deeper, in deliberately distanced
stages, into the peas' profile-
described "tubular" space-path of travel, we found that
the nearer our finger came to the
center line of travel within that "tubular" space-path,
the wider the resulting angle of
deflection of the peas' trajectory. When finally our
finger crossed the tube's center line,
the angular deflection ceased and direct 180-degree
opposition to the line of pea travel
occurred, whereat all the horizontal force originally
imparted to the peas by the pea-
shooter's pneumatic pressure-blowing is almost absorbed
by impact with the finger. The
pea bounces back horizontally for a usually imperceptibly
meager distance before yielding
entirely to gravity and traveling Earthward at 90 degrees
to its original horizontal
trajectory.

 What we also learned observationally before and after
deflecting the peas
experimentally was that gravity went to work on the
peas as soon as they left the tube, and
that as the peas were decelerated by air resistance
below the rate of acceleration that
rendered them approximately immune to the pull of gravity,
that latter force became ever
more effective as the air resistance took its toll of
energy from the peas, and the peas were
deflected progressively Earthward. We also observed
that no wind was blowing, and when
we did not deflect the peas with our finger, they all
followed a progressively descending
path in exactly the same plane until they hit the ground.
Next we learned that if we
intruded our finger horizontally a discrete distance
into the tubular space-path of the peas,
they were deflected at some discrete angle (less than
90 degrees, diametrically away from
the point of entry of our finger into the peas' tubular
space-path), and that if we did not
move our finger further into the tubular space-path,
each traveling pea thus interfered with
deflected the same angular amount horizontally away
from our intruding finger and held
that newly angled direction, yielding further only to
air resistance and gravity, with the
result that each successive pea thus discretely deflected
proceeded in a progressively
curved trajectory, but always within the same vertical
plane. In other words, successively
separate and discretely distanced progressive intrusions
of our finger into the tubular
space-path of travel deflected the vertical plane of
the trajectory of the peas into a new but
again sustained vertical plane of travel, that new vertical
plane occurring each time at a
more abrupt angle from the original nonintruded vertical
plane of the stream of traveling
peas. Thus we learned that we could deliberately aim
the peas to hit targets within the
range of such traveling. (We have all succeeded in deflecting
the trajectory of a pressured
stream of water in just such a manner, but we cannot
see the individual molecules of water
thus deflected and think of it as a continuous stream.)
The discretely modified behavior of
our pea-shooter's individual peas and the individual
steel-ball "hammers" of the Olympic
hammer-thrower altogether permit our comprehension of
the parts played by individual,
but invisible-to-human-eyes energy quanta in bringing
about only superficially witnessed
motion phenomena that most often appear deceivingly
as motionless solids or as swiftly
rotating solid flywheels such as those of gyroscopes.

 Thus we now can understand that our touching the rim
of a flywheel of an
XYZ-axialed and gimbaled gyroscope causes each of the
successively and discretely top-
touched quanta to be deflected downward into a new plane
of travel, accompanied always
by the coincident tilting of the axle of the flywheel,
which always maintains its
perpendicularity to the plane of spin of the flywheel.
The tilting of the plane of spin of the
flywheel, caused by our finger touching the rim of the
spinning wheel, tilts that wheel
around an axis of tilt, which axis is the line diametrically
crossing the circular plane of spin
from the rim point that you touched. This diametric
line is the tilting-hinge line. It runs
directly away from you across the wheel. This means
that as the wheel's extended axle
perpendicular to the flywheel plane tilts with the wheel,
as permitted by the three-axial
degrees of freedom of the gimbaled gyroscope, then the
axle tilts in a plane at right angles
to the tilting-hinge line in the flywheel. Because the
steel wheel and its axle are integral, it
would be in exactly the same plane of force in which
you applied your touch to the
flywheel's rim, if, instead, you took hold of the top
bearing housing the flywheel's top axle
extremity and pulled that gimbal-freed bearing toward
the rim point at which your finger
had applied its initial touch, the bearing housing and
the axle of the flywheel will rotate
exactly sidewise from the direction in which you are
pulling on it because that force makes
the flywheel tilt hingingly around the line running
diametrically across the wheel from your
rim-touching point.

 Thus we learn that pulling the axle bearing atop the
gyroscope toward the
rim-touching point, which is also incidentally pulling
the top axle bearing in the gimbaled
system toward yourself, results in the wheel plane tilting
around the described hinging line,
and the axle and its bearing are thus forced to move
coincidentally in a plane perpendicular
to that hinge line and in the direction which is tangential
to the wheel spinning at the initial
touching point. This means that pulling on top of the
gyroscope does not result in its
yielding toward you, as you might have expected from
its three-axial degrees of gimbaled
freedom, as it would have done had the wheel not been
spinning. Instead, it seemingly
travels rotatingly in a plane at 90 degrees to your
effort and continues to do so so long as
you apply the force, and does so ever more speedily
if you increase the force. This yielding
at a plane angled at 90 degrees to your (or anyone's)
applied effort is <I>precession,</I> which is
the effect of a body in motion on any other body in
motion; the resulting angles of
precession are never in a plane congruent with the precessionally
actuating force.

 Since all Universe is in motion, all the intereffects
of its energy
concentrations as "matter" are always intereffecting
one another precessionally. The pull
of Sun on Earth results in Earth orbiting around Sun
at 90 degrees to the line of Sun's
mass attraction of Earth. Bodies "fall" toward Earth
only when their relatively small size
and the critical proximity of their respectively mutual
orbiting of Sun at 60,000 mph
allows their progressive orbital convergence; the lesser
body is only negligibly affected by
the precessional forces of other astro bodies because
of the second-power rate of
diminution of intermass-attraction occurring as the
intervening distances are increased.

 All the foregoing illustrates the integration of (1)
Newton's mass-attraction
law, (2) precession, and (3) synergy. They are all coming
together here: Kepler, Galileo,
and Newton. The earliest sling-thrower revolving the
sling around his head (angular
acceleration, as it is called by the physicists) demonstrates
the added energy of the sling-
thrower extending the trajectory. The pea-shooter does
the same thing in linear
acceleration. It can extend its trajectories with greater
energy, but its pellets, too, yield to
the gravity of Earth. Earth is very powerful, but the
pea-shooter or the sling-thrower
discover that the harder they swing or blow<SUP>&#95;&#95;</SUP>i.e., the
more energy they put into
accelerating their pellets<SUP>&#95;&#95;</SUP>the farther the pellets go
horizontally before gravity deflects
them at 90 degrees.

 But there is an integration of the horizontal and vertical
planes of applied
forces, between the horizontal plane of your varying
effort and the vertical plane of the
constant Earth's pull. Realization of this integration
may be what inspired Newton. Galileo
used the phrase "accelerating-acceleration," which means
that the velocity is continually
increasing. But the sling-thrower's force was discontinued,
and the air resistance
decelerated its missile until gravity's force at 90
degrees became greater. If the sling-
thrower propelled his missile outside the atmosphere
of Earth and beyond the critical-
proximity limits within which falling in occurs, his
missile would keep on traveling ad
infinitum in an astro-wandering orbit.

 The logic of sensorially satisfactory experience acquired
in the foregoing
elucidation of precession<SUP>&#95;&#95;</SUP>and the discovery of our self-deceivingly-conditioned
reflex in
respect to assuming 180 degrees to be the normal angular
direction of spin-off instead of
reality's 90-degreeness<SUP>&#95;&#95;</SUP>not only renders precession
comprehendible, but can make its
90-degree spin-off and other effects understandably
normal and can explain much that has
heretofore seemed inexplicable and abnormal. The two
angular-acceleration planes
become very important devices of comprehension. In our
generalization of generalizations,
we find that synergy, as "the behavior of whole systems
unpredicted by any of the
systems' parts taken separately," embraces both the
generalized mass attraction and the
precessional laws. Apparently, synergy embraces our
definition of Universe and is
therefore probably the most generalized definition of
Universe.

 The generalizations are of the mind and are omniembracing
and
omnipermeative. Like the rays of Sun, radiations are
radii and are focusable. Gravity
cannot be focused; it is circumferentially embracing.
Radiation has shadows; gravity has
none. Radiation produces the phenomenon known to Einstein
as the bending of space, the
gravitational field.

 Gravitation is omniembracing. In the barrel hoops (see
Sec.
 <A HREF="../s07/p0000.html#705.00">705</A>), gravity
operates only in single and parallel, separate planes.
Omnitriangulated geodesic spheres
consisting exclusively of three-way interacting great
circles are realizations of
gravitational-field patterns. Events are forced to bounce
in spherically contained circles
because they seek the largest possible interior circumference
patterns. All great circles
cross each other twice. Three or more noncongruent great
circles are automatically inter-
self-triangulating in their repetitive searching for
the "most comfortable" interactions,
which always resolve their three-way-great-circle patterning
into regular spherical
icosahedra, octahedra, or tetrahedra. The gravitational
field will ultimately be disclosed as
ultra-high-frequency tensegrity geodesic spheres. Nothing
else.
