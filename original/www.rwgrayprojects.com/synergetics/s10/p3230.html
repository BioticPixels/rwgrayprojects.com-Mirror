The closest packing of concave octahedra, concave vector
equilibria, and spherical vector
equilibria corresponds exactly to the allspace filling
of planar octahedra and planar vector
equilibria (see Sec.
 <A HREF="../s04/p7000.html#470.00">470</A>). Approximately half of the
planar vector equilibria become
concave, and the other half become spherical. All of
the planar octahedra become concave
(see Illus.

 Concave octahedra and concave vector equilibria close-pack
together to
define the voids of an array of closest-packed spheres
which, in conjunction with the
spherical vector equilibria, fill allspace. This array
suggests how energy trajectories may be
routed over great-circle geodesic arcs from one sphere
to another, always passing only
through the vertexes of the array<SUP>&#95;&#95;</SUP>which are the 12 external
vertexes of the vector

 Commencing with the experimentally demonstrated proof
that the
tetrahedron is the minimum structural system of Universe
(i.e., the vectorially and
angularly self-stabilizing minimum polyhedron consisting
of four minimum polygons in
omnisymmetrical array), we then discover that each of
the four vertices of the tetrahedron
is subtended by four "faces," or empty triangular windows.
The four vertices have proven
to be only whole-range tunable and point-to-able noise
or "darkness" centers<SUP>&#95;&#95;</SUP>which are
primitive (i.e., as yet frequency-blurred), systemic
somethings (see Secs.
 <A HREF="../s05/p0400.html#505.65">505.65</A>,
 <A HREF="../s05/p2700.html#527.711">527.711</A>,
and
 <A HREF="p1230.html#1012.33">1012.33</A>) having six unique angularly intersightable
lines of interrelationship whose
both-ends-interconnected six lines produce four triangular
windows, out through which
each of the four system-defining somethings gains four
separate views of the same
omninothingness of as-yet-untuned-in Universe. As subtunable
systems, points are
substances, somethings ergo, we have in the tetrahedron
four somethings symmetrically
arrayed against four nothingnesses. (Four INS versus
four OUTS.)

 The four somethingnesses are mass-interattractively
interrelated by six
interrelationship tensors<SUP>&#95;&#95;</SUP>each tensor having two other
interconnected tensor restraints
preventing one another and their four respective vertexial
somethings from leaving the
system. Like a three-rubber-banded slingshot, each of
the four sets of three restraining, but
in fact vertexially convergent, tensors not only restrains
but also constrains their respective
four <I>somethings</I> to plunge aimedly into-through-and-out
their respectively subtended
triangular windows, into the unresisting nothingness,
and penetrating that nothingness
until the stretchable limit of the three tensors is
reached, whereat they will be strained into
reversing the direction of impelment of their vertexial
somethings. Thus we discovered the
tetrahedron's inherent proclivity to repeatedly turn
itself inside out, and then outside-out,
and reverse. Thus the tetrahedron has the means to convert
its tuned-in-ness to its turned-
out-and-tuned-outness, which inherently produces the
frequencies of the particular
discontinuities of electromagnetic Universe.

 Because there are four symmetrically arrayed sets
of nothingnesses
subtending four somethings, there are four ways in which
every minimum structural
system in Universe may be turned inside out. Ergo, every
tetrahedron is inherently eight
tetrahedra, four outside-out and four inside-out: the
octave system.

 Since the somethings are the INS and the nothingness
is OUT, outside-out
and inside-out are experientially meaningful. There
are inherently a plurality of different
nothingness OUTS consisting of all the potential macro-

other "spherical" somethings with the otherness observer's
spherical something (Secs.
<A HREF="../s04/p1000.html#411.01">411.01-08</A>)
and their four-dimensional symmetry's systemic
intermotion blocking and
resultant system's interlockage, which locking and blocking
imposes total system integrity
and permits whole-system-integrated rotation, orbiting,
and interlinkage with other system
integrities.

 Since we learned by experimental proof that our four-dimensional
symmetry
accommodates three axial freedoms of rotation motion
(see the Triangular-cammed, In-
out-and-around, Jitterbug Model, Sec.
 <A HREF="../s04/p6500.html#465.00">465</A>), while also
permitting us to restrain<SUP>3</SUP> one of
the four axes of perpendicularity to the four planes,
i.e., of the INS most economically<SUP>&#95;&#95;</SUP>
or perpendicularly<SUP>&#95;&#95;</SUP>approaching the tensor relationship's
angularly planed and framed
views through to the nothingness, we find that we may
make a realistic model of the
omniinvolvement field of all eight phases of the tetrahedron's
self-intertransformability.

(Footnote 3: "Restrain" does not mean motionless or
"cosmically at rest."  Restrain does mean "with the axis locked
into congruent motion of another system."  Compare a system holding
in relative restraint one axis of a four-axis wheel model.)

 The involvement field also manifests the exclusively
unique and inviolable
fourfold symmetry of the tetrahedron (see Cheese Tetrahedron,
Sec.
 <A HREF="../s06/p2200.html#623.00">623</A>), which permits
us always to move symmetrically and convergently each<SUP>&#95;&#95;</SUP>and
inadvertently any or all<SUP>&#95;&#95;</SUP>of
the four triangular window frames perpendicularly toward
their four subtending
somethingness-converging-point-to-able IN foci, until
all four planes pass through the
same threshold between INness and OUTness, producing
one congruent, zerovolume
tetrahedron. The four inherent planes of the four tensegrity
triangles of Anthony Pugh's
model<SUP>4</SUP>* demonstrate the nothingness of their four planes,
permitting their timeless<SUP>&#95;&#95;</SUP>i.e.,
untuned<SUP>&#95;&#95;</SUP>nothingness congruence. (See Fig.
 <A HREF="p3230.html#1033.019">1033.019</A>.)
The tuned-in, somethingness
lines of the mathematician, with their inherent self-interferences,
would never permit a
plurality of such lines to pass through the same somethingness
points at the same time (see
Sec.
 <A HREF="../s05/p1500.html#517.00">517</A>).

 <B>Four-triangular-circuits Tensegrity:</B> The four-triangular-circuits
tensegrity
relates to the four great circles of the vector equilibrium.
The four great circles of the

vector equilibrium's eight triangular
faces. Each of the four interlocking triangles is inscribed
within a hexagonal circuit of
vectors<SUP>&#95;&#95;</SUP>of four intersecting hexagonal planes of the
