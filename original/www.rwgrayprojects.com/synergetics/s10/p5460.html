 <B>Orbit as Normal:</B> Ninety-nine point nine-nine plus percent
of the bodies in
motion in physical Universe are operating orbitally;
therefore interyielding normally; i.e., at

 The rare special case of critical proximity, where
bodies converge due to the
extreme disparity of relative mass magnitude, happens
also to be the rare special case in
Universe wherein humans happen to exist, being thereby
conditioned to think of the
special-case exceptional as "normal," thus to misapprehend
the normal general behavior.
The misapprehension regards the 99.99 percent normal
orbital as being strangely perverse.
There is much evidence within the critical-proximity
environment that demonstrates the
normal 90-degree, precessional resultants<SUP>&#95;&#95;</SUP>as, for instance,
when a rope is tensed and
reacting at 90 degrees to the direction of the tensing
and thus becoming tauter.

 <B>Time as Frequency:</B> The Babylonians tried unsuccessfully
to reconcile and
coordinate time and space with circular-arc degrees,
minutes, and seconds. The XYZ,

Time was not a unique dimension. It

 Synergetics is the first to introduce the time dimension
integrally as the
frequency of systems, which initially are metaphysically
independent of time and size but,
when physically realized, have both time and size, which
are identified in synergetics as the
frequency of the system: the modular subdividing of
the primitive, metaphysical, timeless
system.

 You cannot have time without growthability, which implicitly
has a nucleus
from which to grow. We would not have discovered the
frequency or time dimensions had
we not explored the expansiveness-contractiveness and

 <B>Return to the Shell of Homogenized Contents of an Egg:</B>
There are 20
amino acids, and they can all be made in the laboratory.
They always reorganize
themselves in geodesic tensegrity patterns. That's why
you can pull all of the liquid out of
an egg through a tiny needlelike hole, homogenize the
contents, and then put it back in the
shell, and the embryo will reorganize itself<SUP>&#95;&#95;</SUP>even after
the embryo chick is a week old and
has started to form. The amino acids themselves do this.

 In connection with the 20-amino-acid system's indestructibility,
we
intuitively sense the necessity to consider the possible
interrelations of all of the 20 amino
acids' indestructible pattern integrities with other
twentyfoldnesses. The number 20 is
particularly significant in a plurality of nature's
most elementary aspects.

 <B>Icosahedral Twentyness:</B> There is, for instance, the
minimum
twentyfoldness of the icosahedron's 20 equiangular,
triangular (ergo, structural) facets,
which constitute the highest common unit-angle, unit-edge,
and unit-vertex structural
denominator of universal structural systems. The icosahedron
encloses the most volume
with the least energy investment as matter or work.
Universal limits of eternal abstract
principles are indestructible. The discontinuous-compression,
continuous-tension,
multifrequency geodesic, icosahedral structures are
approximately indestructible pattern
integrities. They are employed as the protein shells
of almost all the viruses. In principle,
they are probably involved in the 20 amino acids.

the minimum structural system of Universe: the tetrahedron,

is relevant in this
exploratory speculating to consider that since enzymes
are molecular event integrities and
involve electron-binding proclivities, this introduces
further identification with the fact that
the icosahedron's non-closest-packability tends mathematically
to be identifiable
exclusively with the migrating, trading independence
of the electron and its volumetric
relationship to the vector equilibrium, i.e., 18.51:20,
which is akin to the fractional-number
relationship of the electron's mass to the proton's
mass.

 <B>Twenty-Sphere Models of DNA-RNA Compounds:</B> Furthermore,
the 20-
sphere (atom), closest-packed, non-nucleused tetrahedron
consists of five basic (because
minimum limit) four-ball tetrahedra that, unlike their
planar-faceted polyhedral counterpart
tetrahedra, can be closest-packingly assembled without
octahedral complementation
because the octahedra are internal to the four-ball
basic tetrahedra. It is further relevant to
these considerations that the DNA-RNA code consists
always and only of the four
chemical compounds<SUP>&#95;&#95;</SUP>guanine, cytosine, adenine, and thymine<SUP>&#95;&#95;</SUP>and
that the helix that
they generate consists entirely of tetrahedra whose
four constituents in all vast variety of
combinations will always be the same tetrahelixes.

 That there is an a priori unknown is proven by the
ever unscheduled,
unexpected succession of revelations of additional,
theretofore unknown, unconceived-of,
generalized principles all of which are discovered and
experientially reverifiable as implicit
in Universe. It is also retrospectively manifest that
this progressively amplifying
knowledge, discovered by intuition and mind as constituting
eternally operative cosmic
relationships, was revealed only because of intuitively
pursued, frequent reconsiderations
of information complexes redrawn from the ever-recallable
special-case experience
inventory stored in the humans' brain neuron bank. All
that is known emanated exclusively
from the previously unknown. (See Sec.

 1060.01 The great compressibility of gases is occasioned by
the fact that all the
tetrahedra are interlinked to one another only by single
corners. This is a single bond: it
requires the minimum mass-attraction energy of joining.
You can fill a very great deal of
space with single-bonded tetrahedra; and they are not
only highly compressible or
infoldable but, being universal-jointed, are most flexible,
as are all gases.

 We will now examine two-bonded associations of tetrahedra.
Double-
bonding means two mass-attractions. Double-bonds are
twice as powerfully cohered and
take twice as much energy to disturb their interpatterning.
Double-bonding makes a hinge
between the tetrahedra. They are, therefore, flexibly
interlinked. Forces being applied
telegraph throughout the whole system. Both gases and
liquids have this property of
distributing forces. But whereas single-bonded gases
are highly compactible or
compressible, double-bonded liquids are noncompressible.
If you assemble tetrahedra edge
to edge, you cannot compress them any more even though
they are flexibly hinged. The
coherence of the liquid's viscosity is inherently twice
that of the gases.

 We get even closer inter-mass positioning when there
are three-corner bonds
(i.e., triangular faces congruent with faces). This
produces crystalline rigidity. Crystalline
or triple-bonded structuring does not distribute loads
as do gases and liquids. Nature
designed the triple-bonding to produce the high cohesiveness
in tension of crystalline
structures. Due to its triple-bonding, the most difficult
structure to pull apart is the
crystalline.

 In the structuring of a tree or plant, the crystalline
tensions of liquid cell sacs
are hydraulically filled in order to distribute the
compression and tension loads throughout
the whole structure. The hydraulically filled cells
of the tree are noncompressible. Thus is
the tree capable of holding a five-ton branch out horizontally,
due first to the
noncompressibility of the liquid content of the cell
sacs, and second to the tension being
provided at greatest effectiveness by the triple-bond
crystalline sac skins. Gases are
inserted between the molecules of liquid of the tree's
cell sacs. The gases' compressibility
provides the compressibility or flexibility of the tree's
branches to wave in the wind. If you
have ever tried to hold a 25-pound suitcase out horizontally
at arm's length, you can
appreciate how great a structural task is being performed
when a tree's five-ton branches
wave yieldingly in the storm without breaking off. You
can understand that in an ice
storm, the hydraulic content of the tree's cells freezes
and can no longer distribute the
stresses, and as a consequence during such conditions,
many tree branches break off and
fall to the ground.

 We use these combined single-, double-, and triple-bond
principles in making
the transport airplane's landing gear operate. The pneumatics
are in the airplane's rubber
tires, and the hydraulics operate as nonfreezing liquids
forced through long passageways
of the airplane's undercarriage.

 Nature operates only convergently and divergently,
never in parallel. She
uses equispaced, concentric convergence and divergence.
Trees grow annually by
successively and concentrically producing enveloping,
live, cambium-layer cones divergent
from the green nuclear apex budding and of greater diameter
at the tree's wide and deeply
rooted base.

 Nature's approximately equispaced, concentrically conical,
spherical and
polyhedral convergences and divergences are all asymmetrically
aberrated in respect to
their symmetrical geometries of reference<SUP>&#95;&#95;</SUP>in respect
to which they are progressively

affected by the ever-changing

 As with the misassumptions of "straight" lines, "flat"
planes, and "absolute"
solids, the misassumption of an all-embracing, rectilinearly
associative and disassociative
cosmic system of parallelisms has been occasioned by
too-close, too-short-term, and too-
limited consideration and accounting of humanity's observational
experiences. Splitting a
tree discloses an apparently rough parallelism of grain
running vertically between the
concentric cones, but it proves to be not parallel,
as the concentric spacing gradually
converges toward the conic apexes and diverges toward
the conic tree base.

 Nature's omnidirectional growths and contractions are
accomplished only
convergently and divergently, even when directionally
focused by combined reflective
interference and refractive shunting through lenses.
Even focused radiant energy does not
operate in parallels but in pulsively alternating, convergent-divergent
contractions and
expansions of either the wirelessly beamed or wired-beam
transmissions, both of which
occur in concentric cones. Cones are simply rotated
tetrahedra linked together first base-
to-base and then apex-to-apex, repeat and repeat, with
the number of concentric circles of
any cross section of either the most closely or most
openly spaced concentricity
constituting the cyclic frequency of the special case
transmitting.

 Radiation is omnidirectional entropic divergence from
a nucleus; gravity is
omnidirectional syntropic convergence toward all nuclei.
Cross sections of gravitational
convergence and radiational divergence appear as the
successive concentric cambium
layerings of the cross section of a tree trunk.
