 <B>Biospherical Patterns:</B> Here we see the interplay of
all the biological
systems wherein all the "life"-accommodating organisms
of Earth's biosphere are
exclusively regenerated by energy sent to Earth by radio
from the energy-broadcasting
stars, but most importantly from the star Sun, by which
design-science system the
terrestrial vegetation and algae are the only energy
radio-receiving sets.

 You and I and all the other mammals cannot by sunbathing
convert Sun's
energy to direct life support. In the initial energy
impoundment of the powerful Sun-
energy radiation's exposure of its leaves and photosynthesis,
the vegetation would be
swiftly dehydrated were it not watercooled. This is
accomplished by the vegetation putting
its roots into the ground and drawing the water by osmosis
from the ground and
throughout its whole system, finally to atomize it and
send it into the atmosphere again to
rain down upon the land and become available once more
at the roots.

 Because the rooted vegetation cannot get from one place
to another to
procreate, all the insects, birds, and other creatures
are given drives to cross-circulate
amongst the vegetation; for instance, as the bee goes
after honey, it inadvertently cross-
pollinates and interfertilizes the vegetation. And all
the mammals take on all the gases
given off by the vegetation and convert them back to
the gases essential for the vegetation.
All this complex recirculatory system combined with,
and utterly dependent upon, all the
waters, rocks, soils, air, winds, Sun's radiation, and
Earth's gravitational pull are what we
have come to call <I>ecology.</I>

 As specialists, we have thought of all these design
programmings only
separately as "species" and as independent linear drives,
some pleasing and to be
cultivated, and some displeasing and to be disposed
of by humans. But the results are
multiorbitally regenerative and embrace the whole planet,
as the wind blows the seeds and
insects completely around Earth.

 Seen in their sky-returning functioning as recirculators
of water, the
ecological patterning of the trees is very much like
a slow-motion tornado: an evoluting-
involuting pattern fountaining into the sky, while the
roots reverse-fountain reaching
outwardly, downwardly, and inwardly into the Earth again
once more to recirculate and
once more again<SUP>&#95;&#95;</SUP>like the pattern of atomic bombs or
electromagnetic lines of force. The
magnetic fields relate to this polarization as visually
witnessed in the Aurora Borealis.

 The intereffect of Sun and planets is precessional.
The intereffect of the atom
and the electrons is precessional. They can both be
complex and elliptical because of the
variability in the masses of the satellites or within
the nuclear mass. Planar ellipses have
two foci, but "to comprehend what goes on in general"
we have to amplify the twofold
planar elliptical restraints' behavior of precession
into the more generalized four-
dimensional functions of radiation and gravitation.

 <B>Genetic Intercomplexity:</B> DNA-RNA genetics programming
is
precessionally helical with only a net axial linear
resultant. The atoms and molecules are all
always polarized, and their total interprecessional
effects often produce overall linear
resultants such as the stem of a plant. All the genetic
drives of all the creatures on our
Earth all interact through chemistry, which, as with
DNA-RNA, is linearly programmable
as a code, all of which is characterized by sequence
and intervals that altogether are
realized at various morphologically symmetrical and
closely intercomplementary levels of
close proximity intercomplexity. On the scale of complexity
of ecology, for instance, we
observe spherically orbiting relay systems of local
discontinuities as one takes the pattern
of regenerativity from the other to produce an omniembracing,
symmetrically
interfunctioning, synergetic order. The basic nuclear
symmetries and intertransformabilities
of synergetics omniaccommodates the omnidirectional,
omnifrequencied, precessional
integrity.

 Truth is cosmically total: synergetic. Verities are
generalized principles
stated in semimetaphorical terms. Verities are differentiable.
But love is omniembracing,
omnicoherent, and omni-inclusive, <I>with no exceptions.</I>
Love, like synergetics, is
nondifferentiable, i.e., is integral. Differential means
locally-discontinuously linear.
Integration means omnispherical. And the intereffects
are precessional.

 It is notable that the hard sciences and mathematics
have discovered ever-
experimentally-reverifiable generalizations. But the
social scientists and the behaviorists
have not yet discovered any anywhere-and-everywhere,
experimentally-reverifiable
generalizations. Only economics can be regarded as other
than special-case: that of the
utterly uninhibited viewpoint of the individual. Nature's
own simplest instructional trick in
its economic programming is to give us something we
call "hunger" so that we will eat,
take in regenerative energy. Arbitrarily contrived "scarcity"
is the only kind of behavioral
valving that the economists understand. There is no
other way the economists know how
to cope. Selfishness is a drive so that we'll be sure
to regenerate. It has nothing to do with
morals. These are organic chemical compounds at work.
Stones do not have hunger.

 <B>Metabolic Generalizations:</B> Within economics we may
be able to
demonstrate the existence of a metabolic process generalization
which is akin to, if not
indeed implicitly inherent in, a composite of Boltzman's,
Einstein's, and others' concept of
a cosmically regenerative omniintercomplementation of
a diversity of energetic export-
import centers whose local cosmic episodes nonsimultaneously
ebb and flow to
accommodate the entropically and syntropically, omnidiversally,
omniregenerative
intertransformings of the nonsimultaneous intercomplementations
of nonunitarily
conceptual but finite Scenario Universe. How can economics
demonstrate a generalization
from the utterly uninhibited viewpoint of the individual
human? It is said that stones do
not have hunger. But stones are hygroscopic and do successively
import and export both
water and energy as heat or radiation. New stones progressively
aggregate and
disintegrate. We may say stones have both syntropically
importing "appetites" and self-
scavenging or self-purging entropic export proclivities.

 When a person dies, all the chemistry remains, and
we see that the human
organism's same aggregate quantity of the same chemistries
persists from the "live" to the
"dead" state. This aggregate of chemistries has no metaphysical
interpreter to
communicate to self or to others the aggregate of chemical
rates of interacting associative
or disassociative proclivities, the integrated effects
of which humans speak of as "hunger"
or as the need to "go to the toilet." Though the associative
intake "hunger" is unspoken
metaphysically after death, the disassociative discard
proclivities speak for themselves as
these chemical-proclivity discard behaviors continue
and reach self-balancing rates of
progressive disassociation. What happens physically
at death is that the importing ceases
while exporting persists, which produces a locally unbalanced<SUP>&#95;&#95;</SUP>thereafter
exclusively
exporting<SUP>&#95;&#95;</SUP>system. (See Sec.

 The political, religious, and judicial controversies
prevailing in the late 1970s
with regard to abortion and "the right to life" will
all ultimately be resolved by the
multiplying elucidation for popular comprehension of
science's discovery at the virological
level that the physical and chemical organism of humans
consists entirely of inanimate
atoms. From this virological discovery it follows that
the <I>individual life</I> does not exist
until the umbilical cord is cut and the child starts
its own metabolic regeneration; prior to
that the life in the womb is merely composed of the
mother organism, as is the case with
any one individual egg in her ovary. Life begins with
individually self-startered and
sustained energy importing and dies when that independent
importing ceases.

 Omnitopology is accessory to the conceptual aspects
of Euler's superficial
topology in that it extends its concerns to the angular
relationships as well as to the
topological domains of nonnuclear, closest-packed spherical
arrays and to the domains of
the nonnuclear-containing polyhedra thus formed. Omnitopology
is concerned, for
instance, with the individually unself-identifying concave
octahedra and concave vector-
equilibria volumetric space domains betweeningly defined
within the closest-packed sphere
complexes, as well as with the individually self-identifying
convex octahedra and convex
vector equilibria, which latter are spontaneously singled
out by the observer's optical

of the locally and individual-

Systems are individually conceptual polyhedral
integrities. Human
awareness's concession of "space" acknowledges a nonconceptually
defined experience.
The omniorderly integrity of omnidirectionally and infinitely
extensible, fundamentally
coordinating, closest packing of uniradius spheres and
their ever coordinately uniform
radial expandibility accommodates seemingly remote spherical
nucleations that expand
radially into omniintertangency. Omni-intertangency
evidences closest sphere packing and
its inherent isotropic vector matrix, which clearly
and finitely defines the omnirational
volumetric ratios of the only concave octahedra and
concave vector equilibria discretely
domaining all the in-betweenness of closest-packed-sphere
interspace. The closest-packed-
sphere interspace had been inscrutable a priori to the
limit phase of omni-intertangencies;
this limit phase is, was, and always will be omnipotential
of experimental verification of
the orderly integrity of omni-intercomplementarity of
the space-time, special-case, local
conceptualizing and the momentarily unconsidered, seeming
nothingness of all otherness.

 We learn from the complex jitterbugging of the VE and
octahedra that as
each sphere of closest-packed spheres becomes a space
and each space becomes a sphere,
each intertransformative component requires a tetravolume-12
"cubical" space, while both
require 24 tetravolumes. The total internal-external
closest-packed-spheres-and-their-
interstitial-spaces involvement domains of the unfrequenced
20-tetravolume VE is
tetravolume-24. This equals either eight of the nuclear
cube's (unstable) tetravolume-3 or
two of the rhombic dodecahedron's (stable) tetravolume-6.
The two tetravolume-12 cubes
or four tetravolume-6 dodecahedra are intertransformable
aspects of the nuclear VE's
local-involvement domain.

 While Euler discovered and developed topology and went
on to develop the
structural analysis now employed by engineers, he did
not integrate in full potential his
structural concepts with his topological concepts. This
is not surprising as his
contributions were as multitudinous as they were magnificent,
and each human's work
must terminate. As we find more of Euler's fields staked
out but as yet unworked, we are
ever increasingly inspired by his genius.

 In the topological past, we have been considering domains
only as surface
areas and not as uniquely contained volumes. Speaking
in strict concern for always
omnidirectionally conformed experience, however, we
come upon the primacy of
topological domains of systems. Apparently, this significance
was not considered by Euler.
Euler treated with the surface aspects of forms rather
than with their structural integrities,
which would have required his triangular subdividing
of all polygonal facets other than
triangles in order to qualify the polyhedra for generalized
consideration as structurally
eternal. Euler would have eventually discovered this
had he brought to bear upon
topology the same structural prescience with which he
apprehended and isolated the
generalized principles governing structural analysis
of all symmetric and asymmetric
structural components.

 Euler did not treat with the inherent and noninherent
nuclear system concept,
nor did he treat with total-system angle inventory equating,
either on the surfaces or
internally, which latter have provided powerful insights
for further scientific exploration by
synergetical analysis. These are some of the differences
between synergetics and Euler's
generalizations.

 Euler did formulate the precepts of structural analysis
for engineering and
the concept of neutral axes and their relation to axial
rotation. He failed, however, to
identify the structural axes of his engineering formulations
with the "excess twoness" of
his generalized identification of the inventory of visual
aspects of all experience as the
polyhedral vertex, face, and line equating: V + F =
L + 2. Synergetics identifies the
twoness of the poles of the axis of rotation of all
systems and differentiates between polar
and nonpolar vertexes. Euler's work, however, provided
many of the clues to synergetics'
exploration and discovery.

 While the counting logic of topology has provided mathematicians
with great
historical expansion, it has altogether failed to elucidate
the findings of physics in a
conceptual manner. Many mathematicians were content
to let topology descend to the
level of a fascinating game<SUP>&#95;&#95;</SUP>dealing with such Moebius-strip
nonsense as pretending that
strips of paper have no edges. The constancy of topological
interrelationships<SUP>&#95;&#95;</SUP>the
formula of relative interabundance of vertexes, edges,
and faces<SUP>&#95;&#95;</SUP>was reliable and had a
great potential for a conceptual mathematical strategy,
but it was not identified
operationally with the intertransformabilities and gaseous,
liquid, and solid interbondings
of chemistry and physics as described in Gibbs' phase
rule. Now, with the advent of
vectorial geometry, the congruence of synergetic accounting
and vectorial accounting may
be brought into elegant agreement.

 In topology, then, we have a unique aspect that we
call a line, not a straight
line but an event tracery. When two traceries cross
one another, we get a fix, which is not
to be confused in any way with a noncrossing. Fixes
give geographical locations in respect
to the system upon which the topological aspects appear.
When we have a tracery or a
plurality of traceries crossing back upon one another
to close a circuit, we surroundingly
frame a limited view of the omnidirectional novents.
Traceries coming back upon
themselves produce windowed views or areas of novents.
The areas, the traces, and the
fixes of crossings are never to be confused with one
another: all visual experiences are
resolved into these three conceptual aspects.

 Look at any picture, point your finger at any part
of the picture, and ask
yourself: Which aspect is that, and that, and that?
That's an area; or it's a line; or it's a
crossing (a fix, a point). Crossings are loci. You may
say, "That is too big to be a point"; if
so, you make it into an area by truncating the corner
that the point had represented. You
will now have two more vertexes but one more area and
three more lines than before.
Euler's equation will remain unviolated.

 Operationally speaking, a plane exists only as a facet
of a polyhedral system.
Because I am experiential I must say that a line is
a consequence of energy: an event, a
tracery upon what system? A polyhedron is an event system
separated out of Universe.
Systems have an inside and an outside. A picture in
a frame has also the sides and the back
of the frame, which is in the form of an asymmetrical
polyhedron.

 In polyhedra the number of V's (crossings) plus the
number of F's, areas
(novents-faces) is always equal to the number of L's
lines (continuities) plus the number 2.
If you put a hole through the system<SUP>&#95;&#95;</SUP>as one cores an
apple making a doughnut-shaped
polyhedron<SUP>&#95;&#95;</SUP>you find that V + F = L. Euler apparently
did not realize that in putting the
hole through it, he had removed the axis and its two
poles. Having removed two axial
terminal (or polar) points from the inventory of "fixes"
(loci-vertexes) of the system, the V
+ F = L + 2 equation now reads V + F = L, because two
V's have been deducted from the
inventory on the left side of the equation.

 Another very powerful mathematician was Brouwer. His
theorem
demonstrates that if a number of points on a plane are
stirred around, it will be found after
all the stirring that one of the points did not move
relative to all the others. One point is
always the center of the total movement of all the points.
But the mathematicians
oversimplified the planar concept. In synergetics the
plane has to be the surface of a
system that not only has insideness and outsideness
but also has an obverse and re-
exterior. Therefore, in view of Brouwer, there must
also always be another point on the
opposite side of the system stirring that also does
not move. Every fluidly bestirred system
has two opposed polar points that do not move. These
two polar points identify the
system's neutral axis. (See Sec.
 <A HREF="../s07/p0000.html#703.12">703.12</A>.)

 Every system has a neutral axis with two polar points
(vertexes-fixes). In
synergetics topology these two polar points of every
system become constants of
topological inventorying. Every system has two polar
vertexes that function as the spin
axis of the system. In synergetics the two polar vertexes
terminating the axis identify
conceptually the abstract<SUP>&#95;&#95;</SUP>supposedly nonconceptual<SUP>&#95;&#95;</SUP>function
of nuclear physics' "spin"
in quantum theory. The neutral axis of the equatorially
rotating jitterbug VE proves
Brouwer's theorem polyhedrally.

 When you look at a tetrahedron from above, one of its
vertexes looks like
this: (See Fig. 1007.30)
<BR><BR>
You see only three triangles, but there is a fourth
underneath that is implicit as the base of
the tetrahedron, with the Central vertex D being the
apex of the tetrahedron. The crossing
point (vertex-fix) in the middle only superficially
appears to be in the same plane as ABC.
The outer edges of the three triangles you see, ACD,
CDB, ADB, are congruent with the
hidden base triangle, ABC. Euler assumed the three triangles
ACD, CDB, ADB to be
absolutely congruent with triangle ABC. Looking at it
from the bird's-eye view,
unoperationally, Euler misassumed that there could be
a nonexperienceable, no-thickness
plane, though no such phenomenon can be experientially
demonstrated. Putting three
points on a piece of paper, interconnecting them, and
saying that this "proves" that a no-
thickness, nonexperiential planar triangle exists is
operationally false. The paper has
thickness; the points have thickness; the lines are
atoms of lead strewn in linear piles upon
the paper.

 You cannot have a something-nothingness, or a plane
with no thickness. Any
experimental event must have an insideness and an outsideness.
Euler did not count on the
fourth triangle: he thought he was dealing with a plane,
and this is why he said that on a
plane we have V + F = L + 1 . When Euler deals with
polyhedra, he says "plus 2." In
dealing with the false plane he says "plus 1." He left
out "1" from the right-hand side of
the polyhedral equation because he could only see three
faces. Three points define a
minimum polyhedral facet. The point where the triangles
meet in the center is a polyhedral
vertex; no matter how minimal the altitude of its apex
may be, it can never be in the base
plane. Planes as nondemonstrably defined by academic
mathematicians have no insideness
in which to get: ABCD is inherently a tetrahedron. Operationally
the fourth point, D, is
identified or fixed subsequent to the fixing of A, B,
and C. The "laterness" of D involves a
time lag within which the constant motion of all Universe
will have so disturbed the atoms
of paper on which A, B, and C had been fixed that no
exquisite degree of measuring
technique could demonstrate that A, B, C, and D are
all in an exact, so-called flat-plane
alignment demonstrating ABCD to be a zero-altitude,
no-thickness-edged tetrahedron.
