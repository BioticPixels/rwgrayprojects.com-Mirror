 <B>Indestructibility of Tetrahedron:</B> We have here a pumping
model of the
vector equilibrium. It consists only of the vector lines
of the system formed by 12
uniradius spheres closest packed around one sphere of
the same radius. The
interconnecting lines between those 13 spheres produce
the pumping vector equilibrium
model's skeleton frame. We have also removed the vector
equilibrium's 12 internal double
radii to permit the vector equilibrium system to contract;
thus we have for the moment
removed its nuclear sphere. Every vector equilibrium
has eight tetrahedra with 12 common
edges, a common central vertex, and 12 common exterior
vertexes. Each tetrahedron of
the eight has four planes that are parallel to the corresponding
four planes of the other
seven. Each of the vector equilibrium's eight tetrahedra
has an external face perpendicular
at its center to a radius developed outwardly from the
nucleus. Each of the eight external
triangular faces is interconnected flexibly at each
of its three comers to one other of the
eight triangles. It is found that the whole vector equilibrium
external-vector framework
can contract symmetrically, with the four pairs of the
eight external triangles moving
nontorquingly toward one another's opposite triangle,
which also means toward their
common nucleus. As they do so, each of the four pairs
of exterior triangles approaches its
opposite. When the eight separate but synchronously
contracting tetrahedra diminish in
size to no size at all, then all eight planes of the
eight triangles pass congruently through
the same nuclear center at the same time to form the
four planes of the vector equilibrium.

 Because each of the eight triangles had converged toward
one another as
four opposite pairs that became congruent in pairs,
we seemingly see only four planes
going through the center in the model. There are, however,
really eight planes passing
through the same vector-equilibrium nuclear point at
the same time, i.e., through the
empty, sizeless nucleus.

 As the eight tetrahedra diminished in size synchronously,
their edges became
uniformly smaller at a velocity of the first power;
their areas became smaller at a velocity
of the second power; and their volumes became smaller
at a velocity of the third power<SUP>&#95;&#95;</SUP>
which are three very different velocities. Finally,
they all reached zero velocity and size at
the same time. As they became smaller, however, there
was no change in their respective
foumess of faces; sixness of edges; foumess of vertexes;
nor equilateralness; nor
equiangularity. These are changeless constants. So what
you see in the model is eight
sizeless tetrahedra that became one empty, sizeless,
congruent set, with all their
mathematically constant tetrahedral characteristics
unaltered, ergo, conceptually manifest
as eternity.

 What we speak of as a point is always eight tetrahedra
converged to no size
at all. The eight tetrahedra have been brought to zero
size and are abstracted from time
and special case. They are generalized. Though the empty
vector-equilibrium model is
now sizeless, we as yet have the planes converging to
intercept centrally, indicating the
locus of their vanishment. This locus of vanishment
is the nearest to what we mean by a
point. The point is the macro-micro switchabout between
convergence and divergence.

 We also have learned that a plurality of lines cannot
go through the same
point at the same time. Therefore, the eight perpendiculars
to the centers of area of the
triangle faces and the 12 lines that led to their 12
common outer vertexes, like the
tetrahedra's volumes and areas, have come to common
zero time-space size and can no
longer interfere with one another. We find operationally,
however, that there never was
any paradoxical problem, such as Zeno's "never completable
approach" concept, for we
have learned of the fundamental torque or twist always
present in all experientially
explored system realization, and we find that as each
team of opposite triangles
apprehended the other just upon their nearing the center,
each is whirled 180 degrees, or is
"half spun" about, with its three corners never completely
converging. Whereafter they
diverge.

 Take three round rods of the same diameter and nest
them together in
parallel triangulation. They are now closest-possibly-packed
together. Now slip a
triangular-shaped ring tightly around them and glide
it to their midlength point. Now twist
the ends of the three in opposite directions; the ends
will open outwardly from one another
as triangles. Stand the group on one three-point tripod
end with wires between those
opposite ends to limit their spreading. But they could
also have twisted clockwise for the
half-spin. They could half-spin alternatively to produce
whole-cycle coverage. We find
that three lines converge to critical proximity, then
twist, and spin around one another.
This happens also with all six of the diameters (or
all 12 of the radii) of the vector
equilibrium. (An articulating model of this can be made
with four sets of three stiff brass
wires each, laying the four sets in parallel, closest-packed
bunches and soldering together
the three wire ends at one end of each of the four bunches;
it will be found that their total
of 12 free ends may be lead through one another's mid-girth
in a symmetrically
progressive manner, after which these led-through, four
sets of ends may be respectively
sprung together in sets of three and soldered together;
which model then provides a
number of very exciting intertransformabilities elucidating
the vector equilibrium's
significance.) In the vector equilibrium, the "whole
cycles" are accomplished in four planes
corresponding symmetrically to one another as represented
by the great-circle planes of
the empty-state vector equilibrium or of its eight empty-state
tetrahedra.

 Because the nuclear center of the vector equilibrium
is also the generalized
volumetric center of the spheres in the closest-packed
condition, as well as of the spaces
between the spheres, all of which correspond to all
the vertexes (or all possible system
convergences) of the isotropic vector matrix, we learn
that all three vectorial lines of
Universe can twist by one another producing half-spin,
half-quantum, wave bulgings as
they do without frustrating any form of intertransformative
event development in
Universe, and while also disclosing an absolute compatibility
to, and elucidation of, wave-
quanta behavior in generalized conceptuality.

 Reviewing the same phenomenon once again, we make further
discovery of
the utter interrelatedness of synergetic accommodation,
as we find the half-spin "tepee"
twist also turning the tetrahedron inside out. (See
Sec.
 <A HREF="../s06/p2000.html#621.20">621.20</A>.) Here we find that the
vector equilibrium, or the vector equilibrium's eight
tetrahedra's external vertexes, all
converged toward one another only to suddenly describe
four half-great-circle spins as
they each turned themselves inside out just before the
convergence: thus accomplishing
sizeless invisibility without ever coming into contact.
Eternal interval is conserved. Thus
the paradox of particle discontinuity and wave continuity
is conceptually reconciled. (See
Sec.
 <A HREF="../s09/p7120.html#973.30">973.30</A>.)

 The minialtitude tetrahedron seen as a flattened triangle
has a synergetic
surprise behavior akin to precession. We can flip one
simple white triangle over and find
that the other side is black. One triangle must thus
be considered as two triangles: the
obverse and reverse, always and only coexisting almost
congruent polar end triangles of
the almost zerolong prism.

 Physics tends to think of complementarity and parity
as being the
interrelationship characteristics of two separate phenomena.
Complementarity was
discovered half a century ago, while parity was first
recognized only 20 years ago. In fact
the non-mirror-imaged complementations are two aspects
of the same phenomenon. The
always-and-only-coexisting non-mirror-image complementations
also coexist as
inseparable plural unity.

 We can interconnect the three mid-edged points of an
almost-zero-altitude
tetrahedron, a thin-material triangle, thus subdividing
a big triangle into four smaller
similar triangles. We recall that the big triangle must
be considered as two triangles; the
obverse may be white and the reverse may be black. We
can fold the three corner triangles
around the three lines separating them from the central
triangle, thereby producing two
different tetrahedra. Folding the corner triangles under
or over produces either a white
tetrahedron with a black inside or a black tetrahedron
with a white inside. Since the
outside of the tetrahedron is convex and the inside
is concave, there are two very real and
separate tetrahedra in evidence. Eight faces (four black,
four white) have been evolved
from only four externally viewable triangles, and these
four were in turn evolved from one
(unity-is-plural) triangle<SUP>&#95;&#95;</SUP>an almost-zero-altitude tetrahedral
system or an almost-zero-
altitude prismatic system.

 When the four planes of each of the eight tetrahedra
move toward their four
opposite vertexes, the momentum carries them through
zerovolume nothingness of the
vector equilibrium phase. All their volumes decrease
at a third-power rate of their linear
rate of approach. As the four tetrahedral planes coincide,
the four great-circle planes of
the vector equilibrium all go through the same nothingness
local at the same time. Thus
we find the vector equilibrium to be the inherent zero-nineness
of fundamental number
behavior. (See color plate 31.)

rotating one of them in a 60-degree turn, which precesses
it axially at 60 degrees, thus
pointing its triangular petals toward the other's 60-degree
openings. If we bring them
together edge to edge, we will produce an octahedron.

 The octahedron thus produced has a volume of four tetrahedra.
Each of the
separate tetrahedra had one energy quantum unit. We
now see how one quantum and one
quantum may be geometrically joined to produce four
quanta. Another quantum jump is
demonstrated.

 Each of the two tetrahedra combining to make the octahedron
can consist of
the eight unique combinations of the black and the white
triangular faces and their four
red, green, yellow, and blue center dots. This means
that we have an octahedron of eight
black triangles, one of eight white, and one of four
white plus four black, and that the
alternation of the four different color dots into all
the possible combinations of eight
produces four times
26<SUP>&#95;&#95;</SUP>which is the 104 possible combinations.

 Where N = 8 and there are four sets of 8, the formula
for the number of
combinations is:

This result has a startling proximity to the 92 unique
regenerative chemical elements plus
their additional non-self-regenerative posturanium atoms.
