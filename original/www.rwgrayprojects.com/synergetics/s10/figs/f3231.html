<TR><TD>Fig. 1032.31 Concave Octahedra and Concave Vector Equilibria
Define Spherical Voids and Energy
Trajectories: "Concave octahedra" and "concave vector
equilibria" pack together to define the voids of an
array of close-packed spheres which in conjunction with
the convex spherical vector equilibria fill
allspace. This array suggests how energy trajectories
may be distributed through great-circle geodesic
arcs from one sphere to another always passing through
the vertexes of the array, which are the vertexes
of the vector equilibria and the points where the spheres
touch each other.
