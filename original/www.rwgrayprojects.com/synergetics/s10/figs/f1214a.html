<TR><TD>Fig 1012.14A  Indig Octave System of Four Positive,
Four Negative and Zero-Nine Wave Pattern of Experiential Number: This basic
discontinuous wave disclosure is intimately related to inherent octavization
through tension-chord halving discovered by the Pythagoreans, and the
major-minor-mode "fifthing" obtained by tension-chord thirding of length.
These inherent additive-subtractive, alternate pulsing effects
of number produce positive waves, but <I>not continuously</I>
as had been misassumed.  Zero-or "No-tet, None, Nine" intrudes.
Waves are discontinuous and confirm unit quantation, one tetrahedron
inherently constituting the basic structural system of Universe.
The star Sun's combining of four hydrogen atoms into helium atoms
generates quanta radiation.
