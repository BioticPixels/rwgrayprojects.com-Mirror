Equilibrium Involvement Domain: The Duo-Tet
star polyhedron that first appears in Fig.
 <A HREF="../../s09/p87230.html#987.242">987.242A</A>
is shown here within a vector equilibrium net. The
complex also illustrates the eight Eighth-Octa that
must be added to the eight triangular faces of the
vector equilibrium to form the nucleated cube<SUP>&#95;&#95;</SUP>the total
complex of which functions as the vector
equilibrium nuclear involvement domain. A closest-sphere-packing
evolution of this same transformation
(adding eight Eighth-Octa to the VE's six triangular
faces) appears at Fig.
