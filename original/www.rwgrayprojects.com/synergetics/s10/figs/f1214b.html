<TR><TD>Fig 1012.14B  Wave, Quanta, Indigs, Unity-Is-Plural Bow Ties:
This works for any pair of the ten pairs of tetrahedra in the
vector equilibrium, of which only four pairs are active at any
one time.  The bow-tie waves illustrate the importance of
zero.  They come into phase with one another and with physics
and chemistry.  (Note the "Wave Disconnect" or next-nucleus nothingness.)
