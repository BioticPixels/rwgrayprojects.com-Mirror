<BR> THIS WORK IS DEDICATED TO

<BR> H. S. M. COXETER
<BR> PROFESSOR OF MATHEMATICS
<BR> UNIVERSITY OF TORONTO



<BR> To me no experience of childhood so reinforced self-
<BR> confidence in one's own exploratory faculties
<BR> as did geometry. Its inspiring effectiveness in
<BR> winnowing out and evaluating a plurality
<BR> of previously unknowns from a few given
<BR> knowns, and its elegance of proof
<BR> lead to the further discovery and comprehension of a
<BR> grand strategy for all
<BR> problem solving.
<BR> By virtue of his extraordinary life's work in mathematics,
<BR> Dr. Coxeter is the geometer of our bestirring
<BR> twentieth century, the spontaneously acclaimed
<BR> terrestrial curator of the historical
<BR> inventory of the science of
<BR> pattern analysis.
<BR> I dedicate this work with particular esteem for him
<BR> and in thanks to all the geometers of all time
<BR> whose importance to humanity
<BR> he epitomizes.
