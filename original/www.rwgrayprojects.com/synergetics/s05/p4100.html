 Radiation distributes energy systems outwardly in
omnidiametric directions.
Radiation fractionates whole systems into multidiametrically
dispatched separate packages
of the whole. The packaging of spherical unity is accomplished
by radii-defined, central-
angle partitioning of the spherical whole into a plurality
of frequency-determined, simplest
central divisioning, thus producing a plurality of three-sided
cornucopias formed inherently
at minimum limit of volumetric accommodation by any
three immediate adjacent central
angles of any sphere or of any omnitriangulated polyhedron.
The threefold central-angle
vertex surroundment constitutes the inner vertex definition
of a radially amplified
tetrahedral packet of energy, while the three inner
faces of the energy package are defined
by the interior radial planes of the sphere of omnidiametric
distribution. (There is a great-
circle plane common to any two radii.) The fourth, or
outermost face of the energy
package is the spherical surface triangle of the tetrahedron
which always occurs at the
radial distance outwardly traveled from the original
source at the speed of radiation,
symbolized as lower-case c. (See color plate 10.)

 Radiation is pushive, ergo tends to increase in curvature.
Gravity is tensive,
ergo tends to decrease its overall curvature. The ultimate
reduction of curvature is no
curvature. Radiation tends to increase its overall curvature
(as in the "bent space" of
Einstein). The pushive tends to arcs of ever lesser
radius (microwaves are the very essence
of this); the tensive tends to arcs of ever greater
radius. (See Sec. <A HREF="../s10/p0810.html#1009.56">1009.56</A>.)

 The excess effectiveness of gravity over radiation
equals the excess of
cosmic integrative forces over cosmic disintegrative
forces. This gain of syntropy over
entropy is invested in the constant intertransformations
and transpositionings of eternally
regenerative Scenario Universe.

 The vector equilibrium provides a vector model of
these functions: the 24
circumferential vectors of the vector equilibrium close
back upon themselves and are
united in the interconnection of their ends, providing
integrative effectiveness of the
circumferential vectors vs the individually acting,
disintegrative abandonment of the total
associative effectiveness of the 24 radial vectors of
the vector equilibrium. These
represent, respectively, the total gravitational forces
of Universe and the total radiational
forces of Universe, rendering the total integrative
forces of Universe to be inherently more
efficient than the total disintegrative forces of Universe.
The excess efficiency of the
integrative over the disintegrative provides an energy
bonus that is cosmically reinvested
in local intertransformings of nonsimultaneous, nonunitarily
conceptual, almost-totally-
invisible-to-humans Scenario Universe.

 Thus gravity uses energy more efficiently than radiation,
which accounts for
the eternal dominance of syntropy over entropy. The
energy conserved is invested in the
constant transformative transpositioning of the eternal
regeneration of Universe. The
dominance of syntropy over entropy is the dominance
of the metaphysical over the
physical and guarantees an eternal resolution of all
conflicts between the physical and the
metaphysical in favor of the metaphysical. Mind will
always win over energy.
Omniconsiderate love will always win out over ruthless
selfishness, but the score is only
cosmically accounted and the meager, momentarily-visible-and-tunable
considerations
cannot so inform the inherently limited comprehension
of the local players. The players
may easily be deluded into misassuming that momentary
victories won by treachery or
physical force are of lasting importance. The invisible
design provides for the only-slowly-
gestating self-education of humanity from naked, helpless
ignorance at birth, through
individual trial-and-error coping with necessities,
to omnigraduation into functioning with
omnireliable., omniloving, intellectual-integrity-governing
individuals of an omnifaithfully
operative and truthful society. The cosmic design often
employs precession to guide the
ignorant players into inadvertently producing the evolutionarily
necessary regenerative
integrity functions, while the ignorant are consciously
preoccupied only in vain and
selfishly expedient ends.

 The cosmic excess of integrative effectiveness and
constancy is manifest in
the successively repeatable, self-intertransformative
"jitterbug" articulation of the vector
equilibrium as it contracts rotationally, symmetrically,
and precessionally, thereby
successively to transform from the 20-quanta-volume
vector equilibrium to the 4-volume
octahedron to the volume-of-1 positive tetrahedron to
the volume-of-l negative
tetrahedron.
(See Illus. <A HREF="../s04/p6000.html#460.08">460.08</A>
and <A HREF="../s04/p6000.html#461.08">461.08</A>.)
The jitterbug
articulation turns around at the
negative tetrahedron to reexpand therefrom, returning
through all of those volumetric
stages to its original 20-volume integrity, to be alternately
recontracted through all the 20-
to-1 and 1-tetravolume-to-20 without any break ever
occurring in the circuitry integrity of
the vector-chord closures and intertriangulation in
the four planes of the four-dimensional
symmetry. The syntropic integrity capability of the
vector-equilibrium jitterbug articulation
also discloses the means by which nature can effect
as much as a 20-to-1 symmetrical and
locally volumetric disappearance from visibility.

 Polygonally all spherical surface systems are maximally
reducible to
omnitriangulation, there being no polygon of lesser
edges. And each of the surface
triangles of spheres is the outer surface of a tetrahedron
where the other three faces are
always congruent with the interior faces of the three
adjacent tetrahedra. Ergo, you have a
four-face system in which it is clear that any four
colors could take care of all possible
adjacent conditions in such a manner as never to have
the same colors occurring between
two surface triangles, because each of the three inner
surfaces of any tetrahedron integral
four-color differentiation must be congruent with the
same-colored interior faces of the
three and only adjacent tetrahedra; ergo, the fourth
color of each surface adjacent triangle
must always be the one and only remaining different
color of the four-color set systems.

 Radiation is special case, systematically centered,
and discontinuously
islanded. Gravity is continuous tension omni-inter-between
all systems. Because
gravitational, intertensional intensivity varies as
the second power of the arithmetical
interdistancing variations, whose unique variations
are locally periodic, it manifests
periodic intensities of tidal pulls, but the overall
tensional integrity is constant independent
of local variabilities in intensity.

 Electromagnetic radiation is distributive and entropic;
its frequency
magnitudes represent multiplication by division. Gravity
is nondivisive and syntropic; its
conservation is accomplished by holistic embracement
of variable intensities. Gravity is
integral. Holistic gravity has no frequency.

 Earth's biospheric inventory of water is radially
dispersed outwardly by
vaporization and omnilocally condensed as inwardly "falling"
drops of rain, which are
gravitationally and convergently collected as ocean.
