 Weightless, abstract human mind reviews and from time
to time discovers
mathematically reliable and abstractly statable interrelationships
existing between and
amongst, but not "in" or "of," any of the special-case
experience components of the
relationship. When a long-term record of testing proves
the relationship to persist without
exception, it is rated as a scientifically generalized
principle. Whenever human mind
discovers a generalized principle to exist amongst the
special-case experience sets, the
<I>discovery event</I> itself becomes a <I>new</I> special-case experience
to be stored in the brain bank
and recalled when appropriate. Amongst a plurality of
brain-stored, <I>newly understood
experiences,</I> mind has, from time to time, discovered
greater and more significant
understandings, which in their turn as discoveries,
which are "experiences," constitute
further <I>very</I> special-case experiences to be stored in
the recallable and reconsiderable brain
bank's wealth of special-case experiences.

 We may say that thinking about the truth alters truth,
but only to the extent
of defining it. We may always clarify and redefine the
truth by making it more
comprehensively considerate and more incisively exquisite.
Truth alters truth only by
refining the definition. The substance of the sensing
and instrumental control of the
physical means of communication is always refinable
and tends toward the
ephemeralization of doing ever more with ever less,
but you can never get to the exact,
most economical statement of the truth, for the very
communication will have
ephemeralized to pure metaphysics. Truths are like generalized
principles:
interaccommodative and nonintercontradictory. Truths
are special case realizations of the
generalized principles; by these very aspects are they
discovered to be truths.

 Truth is special case. Truths tend to articulate generalized
principles. All the

 As humans are physically situate halfway between the
largest and smallest
known bio-organisms, they are also halfway between the
astro-largest and nuclear-smallest
physical phenomena; humans thus find themselves between
an absolute, omnidirectional,
equilibrious, dimensionless, metaphysical core contained
within a spheric twilight zone of
macro-almost-true and themselves containing a spheric
twilight zone of micro-almost-true.
As humans are in the middle of the cosmic scheme metaphysically,
truth itself is an
unreachable, omnidirectional, cosmic center. The truth
is zero eternal.
Temporality=tempo-reality=time-reality. In temporality
you cannot reach the truth. You
cannot be exact because truth is zero. Absolute truth
is an omnizerophase condition. The
metaphysical comprehension passes through, expandingly
and contractively, but fails ever
to remain at the zero core of equilibrious truth.

 As we reduce the tolerance for error, we begin to
get near the eternal, which
is what we call the truth. But we will never quite get
there. The inexhaustibly attractive
and truthfully inspired thoughts of human minds ever
approach an evolutionary refinement
while constantly intertransforming as a precessional
consequence of progressively
experienced complexes of omniinteraccommodative, intercomplementary
transactional
events; the process results in ever-closer proximity
to perfect equilibrium of all
intertransformative forces, but it never attains such
equilibrium.

 Truth may be dealt with only as relative relationships
of interactions of
dynamic principles. Degrees of accuracy are refinements
that in no way affect the
fundamental reliability of the directional or angular
sense toward centralized truths. Truth
is a relationship; it is a direction rather than an
attainment. The search for truth is a
yielding to the integrity of the intellect, revealing
information and nuances that are ever
more impressive, more delicate, and more exciting.

 Truth is the progressive diminution of residual error.
The generalizations are
eternal. The more accurately we state the truth, the
less frequently it becomes necessary to
modify our statement of it. We have to change what we
say less and less. Eventually it
works back to the eternality of No Change.

 Euler said that we are dealing in pattern. Mathematics
is pattern, and there
are irreducible aspects of pattern. That is, the patterns
represent events. A line is a unique
kind of pattern. If I have two lines, where the two
lines cross is distinctly different from
where the two lines do not cross. Euler called this
the vertex, the convergence. He saw
this as absolute pattern uniqueness.

 Euler showed that all optical experiences that we

composed exclusively of three patterning elements: lines,
vertexes, and areas<SUP>&#95;&#95;</SUP>or
<I>trajectories, crossings,</I> and <I>openings,</I> as they are known

incontrovertible minimum aspects of pattern are all
that is necessary to analyze and
inventory all parts of all optically apprehended patterns
as well as of all whole patterns.
And Euler disclosed three algebraic formulae characterizing
the constant relative-
abundance relationships of these three fundamental topological
elements in all patterns.

 Each of the chemical elements is a uniquely complex
pattern of energy event
interrelatednesses which interact inter-interferingly
to continually relocalize the involved
quantity of energy. These self-interference patterns
of atomic element components are in
many ways similar to the family of knots that are tied
with rope by sailors to produce
various local behaviors, all of which, however, result
in further contraction of the knot as
the two ends of the rope immediately outside the knot
are pulled away from one another
by forces external to the knot<SUP>&#95;&#95;</SUP>and thus all the attractive
forces of Universe operating
upon the atoms may result precessionally in keeping
the atomic knots pulled together.

 When we drop a stone into water, we see a wave emanate
outwardly in a
plane. We agree that it is not water but that we are
seeing a wave in pure principle. It is
not simultaneous: therefore to conceptualize we are
using our memory and afterimage. We
can never have static waves; they have nothing to do
with statics. We see a wave
operative in time and in pure principle. If we initiate
wave-propagating energy action at
one point, a complete omnidirectional wave develops.

 When a stone is dropped into a tank of water, the
stone does not penetrate
the water molecules. The molecules are jostled; they
"accommodate" the stone and in the
process jostle their neighboring molecules, which, in
turn, jostle their own outwardly
surrounding water molecule neighbors. Thus waves of
relayed jostling are propagated.
Each relayed wave, although a composite of locally forwarded
actions, provides a
synergetic continuity scenario of those actions. The
consequence is a pattern of events that
has an integrity of its own, independent of the local
displacement accommodations (which
are innocent with respect to the overall synergetic
pattern).

 The same stone dropped successively in pools of water,
milk, or gasoline
will generate the same wave patterns. Yet the waves
are essences neither of milk nor of
water nor of gasoline. The waves are distinct and measurable
pattern integrities in their
own right, visibly growing and traveling outwardly as
each locally involved molecule of
the liquids develops a narrow vertical ellipse circuitry
returning to where it started, unless
a powerful wind operating parallel to and above the
liquid blows the top molecules free as
bubbles to tumble down the wave side like water on a
hillside. (See Sec. <A HREF="../s10/p0000.html#1005.14">1005.14</A>.)

 Individuals regenerate their own sound and air displacement
waves and
ripples in the physical environment just as stones create
waves and ripples in the different
liquids into which they are thrown. They also propagate
metaphysical wave patterns that
develop local pattern displacements in the human affairs
cosmos. They also propagate
both conscious and unconscious electromagnetic waves.
The wave is as abstract as the

 The room we sit in is permeated by thousands of weightless
waves, each of
unique character. You can tune in hundreds of wide-frequency-range
radios within your
room, and each can bring in a different program from
a different part of the world because
the individual, weightless waves flow through trees
and house walls. That extraordinary

mathematical laws, not by the opinions

 One of the things we have to make clear for society
is the intellectual
dilemma of the Max Planck-descended scientists: the
way they do their problems, they can
have either a wave or a particle but not both simultaneously.
Heisenberg has the same
dilemma. They make the error of thinking of a wave as
a physical continuity rather than as
a metaphysical, weightless pattern integrity, experimentally
detectable only by virtue of the
medium of the locally displaced, frequency tuned, physical
phenomenon<SUP>&#95;&#95;</SUP>a principle
operating utterly independent of any physical medium.

 The science of pattern is mathematical. As the fundamental
communications
system of all the sciences mathematics is both the most
comprehensive and the most
abstract of the sciences. Experimentally discovered
mathematical relationships permit
generalized statements of such laws as are found to
be governing all science, and all
sciences must use mathematics. Nonexperimentally disclosed
mathematical relationships
can be imaginatively evolved, however, but they may
or may not have identity with
physical Universe behavior. It is for instance mathematically
feasible to explore a
hypothetical Universe theoretically devoid of any one
of the family of mathematical
operations, such as, for instance, a Universe in which
there is only multiplication and no
division, or an exclusively two-dimensional Universe.

 Employing only mathematics in the analysis of physically

 Synergetics conceptualizes in generalized principles,
in contradistinction to
special-case empirics. We may logically hypothesize
either (a) that mathematics is entirely
physical, or (b) that the physical is in reality pure
abstract principle. You can play the game
either way: both are valid, but not simultaneously.
There are certainly not two absolutely
separate and independently operating Universes: the
abstract Universe of the
mathematician and the energetic Universe of the physiochemist.

 You cannot have a line that is less than a line, or

or a virgin that is less than a virgin. Nature comes
to minimum-limit case with all her
points in order to feel very comfortable. But the resolution
is not linear or planar: it is

 You grow or decrease. You get better or worse. In
parallelism things do not
converge. Science is not getting the right answers because
scientists do not think
divergently and convergently. If you are in parallel,
you can never get to any conclusion
whatsoever. Waves require hierarchies.

 An area is a nothingness. A plurality of areas are
views of nothingness
through separate frames. A point is a somethingness.
A line is a relationship between two
somethingnesses. An enlarged, apparently single somethingness
may prove to be
resolvable into a plurality of somethingnesses between
which the lines of interrelationship
fence off the nothingness into a plurality of separately
viewable nothingnesses. Points are
unresolvable, untunable somethingnesses occurring in
the twilight zone between visible
and supravisible experience.

 <I>Awareness</I> seems to be the one minimal word best expressing
the experience
of life. Awareness is inherently plural, for it consists
of the individual system that becomes
aware and the first minimum otherness of which it is
aware: such otherness may be
integrally internal or externally separate of the observing
system. We say, "No otherness:
no awareness"
(Sec. <A HREF="../s09/p0500.html#905.02">905.02</A>).
A philosopher may question
that statement, saying, "No,
you are wrong because awareness can be exclusively of
self." But we reply by
recapitulating the inherent minimum topology of awareness:
<SUP>&#95;&#95;</SUP> minimum self and minimum otherness are both systems,
each having both
insideness and outsideness;

 Ergo, the minimum cognition employs the information-sensing,
remembering, and recognizing circuitry of the organic
substance's minimum self-sensing
awareness, which could only be at a minimum <I>one</I> as a
system of four minimum-event
components, being aware of its own integral system's
otherness-defining components.
Ergo, experientially, no otherness: no awareness. Q.E.D.

 All minimum otherness or all minimum-observer <I>self</I>
are both plural unity
with mutual interawareness. Interawareness means one
system aware of another system or
the outsideness of a system aware of its system's insideness.

 The observer and the observed constitute two points
differentiated against an
area of nothingness with an inherent interrelationship
line of awareness running between
the two points.
(See Sec. <A HREF="../s02/p5000.html#264.01">264.01</A>.)
Thus there is a minimum
set of four awareness aspects
of life:
<OL TYPE="1">
<LI> the observer;
<LI> the observed;
<LI> the line of interrelationship; and
<LI> the background nothingness against which the somethingness
is observed.

 When we draw a spherical triangle on the Earth's surface
(Fig. <A HREF="../s08/p0000.html#812.03">812.03</A>), it
demonstrates an aspect of geometry apparently not recognized
by Euler. The spherical
triangle also demonstrates self and otherness. The spherical
triangle is the first awareness:
there is an inherent twoness in the triangle's insideness
and outsideness; and the axis of the
two poles constitutes the two points of self and otherness.
The <I>background nothingness</I> of
these two points represents an area not contained by
a line. Euler apparently did not
realize that there could be an area not contained by
a line.

 From Euler we know that the number of locally identified
minimum entities
called <I>points</I> plus the number of separate <I>areas</I> equals
the number of <I>lines</I> plus the number
two. In minimum awareness we have two identified entities
which, being local points,
must have directional fixedness against a background
of nothingness. Ergo, in minimum
awareness two points plus one area of nothingness have
one inherent line of most
economical interrelationship between the two points.
These two points plus one area equal
the number of lines-in this case "one" plus Euler's
abstractly accommodative two. (The
line of interrelationship is another aspect of the prime
vector. See Sec. <A HREF="p3900.html#540.10">540.10</A>.)
