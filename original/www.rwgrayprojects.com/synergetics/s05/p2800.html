 Conceptuality operates independent of size. Whether
referring to the size of
an object in respect to other objects or the sizes of
any one object's subdivisions, size
emerges exclusively as a cyclic-frequency concept, uniquely
differentiating out each
special-case experience.

 Size is a measure of three kinds of energetic experience:
a measure of
relative magnitude of separate linear, areal, and volumetric
rates of change, and each one
has a differently rated change velocity. Size and size
alone can come to zero.

 Size is the concept of one experience's relationship
to another experience
defined in terms of cyclic repetition of any one experimentally
demonstrable, self-
terminating, or single-cycle experience. A triangle
or a tetrahedron or a sphere is a triangle
or a tetrahedron or a sphere conceptually independent
of size. An angle is an angle
independent of the length of its edges. All of Plato's
solids may have the same length
edges because their differences are entirely angular.
An angle is inherently a subdivision of
a single cycle. Therefore, an angle is subsize.

 Size begins with one specific cycle's completion.
As the linear size of an
object is doubled, surface is fourfolded and volume
is eightfolded; ergo, areas increase at a
velocity of the second power, and volumes increase at
a velocity of the third power. Ergo,
size-variation relationships are deceptive and not superficially
predictable by any one
experience.

 Distance is measured in time. Time increments are
calculated in respect to a
variety of cyclic regularities manifest in our environmental
experiences. Experimentally
demonstrable cyclic regularities, such as the frequencies
of the reoccurrence of radiation
emissions of various atomic isotopes, become the fundamental
time-increment references
of relative size measurement of elemental phenomena.

 Newton said that time was a very specific phenomenon,
assuming that there
was a specific and finite time that permeated Universe
and that everything observable in
Universe was occurring at the same time. It was Einstein
who discerned that time might be
relative to the individual observer. A majority of academic
people and the vast majority of
nonscientists are still thinking in terms of the classical
Newtonian scientific conceptioning
of "instant Universe." While light's speed of approximately
700 million miles per hour is
very fast in relation to automobiles, it is very slow
in relation to the "no time at all" of
society's obsolete instant-Universe thinking. It was
part of the classical scientist's concept
of instant Universe that Universe is a system in which
all parts affect one another
<I>simultaneously</I> in varying degrees. Contemporary science
as yet assumes that all local
systems in physical Universe are instantly and simultaneously
affecting one another in
widely ranging degrees of influence. (And the degrees
of influence are governed by
relative proximity.) Whereas radiation, i.e., entropy,
casts shadows and gravity, syntropy,
does not; and whereas the tensional integrity of Universe
and all its substructurings is
continuous and omniembracing<SUP>&#95;&#95;</SUP>while compression is islanded
and discontinuous<SUP>&#95;&#95;</SUP>it may
also be that while light and radiation has a velocity,
gravity is timeless and eternally
instant. (See Secs. <A HREF="../s02/p2400.html#231.01">231.01</A>,

 All the time phenomena of the physicists are expressed
in linear data
coordinates, but all cyclic actions are spirals because
there are no straight lines and also
because lines cannot "go through" or "return into" themselves.
There can be no
experientially demonstrable circles as continuous lines
"returning into" themselves. Lines
cannot return into themselves. Therefore matter is a
cyclic self-interfering <I>knotting;</I>
whereas radiation's waves are non-self-interfering <I>spirals.</I>

Which reads: matter is to radiation as knots of rope
are to coils of rope. Because there are
no planes, a wave is a spiral. A spiral articulated
in a direction perpendicular to our
observation presents an illusory, wavilinear, planar

 Generalized principles are often called constants
by the semantics of
scientific specialization, whose viewpoint is myopic.
Constancy is a time concept. Time is
relative and cyclically terminal. Time is energetic,
physical, and ever finitely

 Minimal consciousness evokes a nonsimultaneous sequence,
ergo <I>time.</I> Time
is not the fourth dimension and should not be so identified.
Time is only a relative
observation, a set of local sequences of experience
afterimage formulation lags of the
brain. Time is not a function of space. We can discuss
time as if there were no time. It
exists in weightless, metaphysical conceptuality. There
is a metaphysical timeless time, just
as there is a difference between physical tetrahedron
and metaphysically conceptual but
weightless, substanceless tetrahedron. Instantaneity
would eliminate otherness, time, and
self-and-other-awareness. Instantaneity and eternity
are both timeless: they are the same.

 The concept of being alive may be inherent only in
the eternal principle of
differentiability, and of a theoretical number system,
and of complexes of different
numbers. Seeming consciousness and life may well be
inherent only in mind-conceivable
theories of differentiations. To perceive of "truth"
involves the concept of "nontruth,"
ergo, of differentiation. An intellectual integrity
of Universe evokes its own theoretical
evolvement of a Universe of ever-multiplying problems
and pure-principles solutions and
regeneration of multiplying problem-solving. (See Secs.

 The measuring act always involves time increments
of our totally available
time of life and may be conceived of only in respect
to local events in nonsimultaneous
Universe, there being no overall <I>largest</I> size to be
referred to. Einstein was able to show
that every individual's every-time employed yardstick
of time (that is, the cyclic increment
of imaginary reference) is always unique and different
from every other's, a difference that
amplifies greatly as we enter into astronomical observing
by individual instruments, whose
progressively designed reduction of tolerated error
is always unique and only calculable
relative to each experience.

 It is a consequence of the phenomenon time and a consequence
of the
phenomena we call afterimage, or thinking, or reconsideration,
which has inherent lags in
the time rates of recallability of the various special-cases

 It is one of the strange facts of experience that
when we try to think into the
future, our thoughts jump backward. It may well be that
nature has some fundamental
metaphysical law by which opening up what we call the
future also opens up the past in
equal degree. The metaphysical law corresponds to the
physical law of engineering that
"every action has an equal and opposite reaction. "

 The future is not linear. Time is wavilinear. Experience
is expansive,
omnidirectionally including and refining the future.
It probably consists of omnidirectional
wave propagations. We seem to be talking about a greater
range of known cycling. It is
both a subjective "now" and an objective "now"; a forward-looking
now and a backward-
looking now which combine synergetically as one complete
"now." Because every action
has both a reaction and a resultant, every now must
have both a fading past and a dawning
future.

 The top speed of radiation is simply the minimum operational
lag before
making the cosmic leap to the eternal no-speed, where
the instantaneity spontaneous to a
child's conceptioning is normal and eternal. Not that
it is ever lost. None of the
differentiation of the generalized principles is lost.
Many principles as yet undiscovered are
nonetheless operative. Understanding is exquisitely
total. Understanding includes a large
increment of intuition to account for the as-yet-undiscovered
but nonetheless operative
generalized principles.

 The norm of Einstein is absolute speed instead of
"at rest" . . . what we
called instantaneous in our innocence of yesterday.
We get to lesser and lesser lags, and
we then approach eternal instantaneity<SUP>&#95;&#95;</SUP>no lag at all.
We have now learned, however,
from our generalizations of the great complexity of
the interactions of principles, that as
we are disembarrassed of our local exclusively physical
chemistry, our local information-
sensing devices, what will be realized is an eternal
and instantaneous awareness of all the
potentials that ever existed. All the great metaphysical
integrity of the individual, which is
potential in the complex of interactions of the generalized
principles, will always and only
coexist eternally. I am saying that the arrival rate
of intellect vs. the top-speed of radiation
manifests the minimum lag short of no lag at all, i.e.,

 Thought discovers that we divide Universe into an
"outwardness and
inwardness," so thinking is the first subdivision of
Universe, because Universe, we
discovered, was finite. Thinking is a nonsimultaneously
recallable aggregate of inherently
finite experiences and finite experience furniture<SUP>&#95;&#95;</SUP>such
as photons of light. One of the
most important observations about our thought is the
discovery that experiences are
nonsimultaneous. Nonsimultaneity is a fundamental characteristic,
and if experiences are
nonsimultaneous, you cannot have simultaneous reconsideration.

 All the words of all the vocabularies could be said
to represent all the
formalized attempts of men to communicate all their
experiences. So we could set out to
examine all the dictionaries of the world. We can pick
up any one dictionary and discover
that it is a nice finite package. We can open one page,
but we cannot look at all the words
at once. If we cannot look at all the words even on
one page, we certainly cannot look at
all the words of a whole dictionary at once. It does
not make the dictionary infinite
because we cannot look at all the words at once or think
about all the words at once. The
inability to think about everything at once does not
mean that experience or consideration
of experience is infinite. It is perplexing that one
of the most persistent contemplations of
human beings has been predicated on a static concept
of Universe, the kind of Universe
that went out with classical Newtonian mechanics. We
cannot think of Universe as a fixed,
static picture, which we try to do when people ask where
the outwardness of Universe
ends. Humans try to get a finite unit package. We have
a monological propensity for the
<I>thing,</I> the <I>key,</I> the <I>building block</I> of Universe. What
we discover here is that it is not
possible to think about all Universe at once. It is
nonsimultaneously conceptual. This in no
way mitigates against its finiteness and thinkableness.

 The parents tell the child he cannot have both the
Sun and the Moon in the
picture at the same time. The child says that you can.
The child has the ability to
coordinate nonsimultaneity. The parents have lost the
ability to coordinate
nonsimultaneity. One of our great limitations is our
tendency to look only at the static
picture, the one confrontation. We want one-picture
answers; we want key pictures. But
we are now discovering that they are not available.

 We can think about all the experiences progressively
and successively. And
we can coordinate our thoughts about our experiences.
Our very ability to think is such a
propensity for the coordination of the reconsiderations
of relationships. We do not have to
be simultaneous to be interconnected. We can telephone
across the international date line
from Sunday back to Saturday.

 We have had a tendency in our thinking to say that
what is finite is statically
conceptual as a one-unit glimpse, so we have been seemingly
frustrated in trying to
understand Universe, which is an omnidirectional experience,
and so we feel there ought
to be an outwardness of this sphere. That is a static
concept. We are not dealing with such
a sphere at all, because we have all these nonsimultaneous
reports, and all we have is the
interconnectedness of the nonsimultaneity. One of Einstein's
most intellectual discoveries
was this nonsimultaneity, which he apparently could
have come upon by virtue of his
experience in examining the thoughts of inventors and
their patent claims regarding
timekeeping devices, watches, and clocks.

 The speed-of-light measurements plus Planck's quantum
mechanics and
Einstein's relativity showed that Universe is an aggregate
of nonsimultaneous events.
Their experiments showed that as each of the nonsimultaneous
events lost their energy,
they lost it to newly occurring events. Thus energy
always became 100 percent accounted
for.

 All Universe is in continual transformation. The geology
of our Spaceship
Earth makes it very clear how very severe have been
the great transformations of history.
The movement of topsoils around the surface of the Earth
is very new, geologically
speaking. As Einstein interpreted the speed-of-light
information and the observation of the
Brownian movement of the constant motion in water, he
then posited a Universe in which
we knew that light takes eight minutes to get to us
from Sun and two and a half years to
get to us from the nearest star; astronomical information
shows that some of the stars we
are looking at are live shows coming in from 100 years
ago, others from 1,000 years ago,
while the light from some of the stars we are looking
at started on its way over a million
years ago. With that kind of information, Einstein had
to say physical Universe is quite
obviously an aggregate of nonsimultaneous and only partially
overlapping transformation
events.

 Any point can tune in any other point in Universe
(Sec. <A HREF="../s09/p5550.html#960.08">960.08</A>). Between
any two points in Universe there is a tetrahedral connection
(see Sec. <A HREF="../s09/p5550.html#961.30">961.30</A>). Thus
systematic connection of two points results in the interconnecting
of four points. But none
of the four event points of the tetrahedron are simultaneous.
They are all overlappingly co-
occurrent, each with different beginnings and endings.
All of the atoms are independently
introduced and terminaled; many are in gear<SUP>&#95;&#95;</SUP>that is,
synchronously tuned<SUP>&#95;&#95;</SUP>but many are
also way out of gear, untuned, or "noisy."

 Nouns can co-occur at the same time, but verbs cannot.
Events can never be
omnicongruently simultaneous, which would mean having
all the component four events'
beginnings and endings always simultaneous. Events occur.
Occur is a time word. The
overlappingness of Scenario Universe
(see Sec. <A HREF="../s03/p2000.html#320.00">320</A>)
makes events appear simultaneous
when they are not. Events are only overlappingly co-occurrent
but never
omnisimultaneous.

 All the four unique electromagnetic frequencies of
the 92 chemical elements
are uniquely different, yet many are intersynchronizable
in overlapping occurring alloys,
whose unique sets of interattractive interrelationships
produce the synergetically unique
behaviors of those specific alloys.
