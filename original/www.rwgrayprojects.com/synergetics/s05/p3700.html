 Nothing stands in a vacuum of Universe. Nothing can
change locally without
changing everything else. We have to look for conditions
where there is permitted
transformability and where there is some really great
unanimity of degrees of freedom. We
see that certain kinds of patterns accrue from certain
numbers of restraints. You could see
how planar things could happen as a consequence of two
restraints and how linear things
could happen as a consequence of three restraints. (See
Sec. <A HREF="../s04/p0100.html#401.00">401</A>, Twelve Vectors of
Restraint Define Minimum System.) We see, then, that
we are in a Universe where there is
a certain limited number of permitted freedoms. Synergetics
discovers that whatever is
rigidly related to anything else discloses 12 restraints.
There are a minimum of 12
restraints in developing anything we might call a rigidly
related set of events.

playing the game, the most complicated game of chess
that has ever been played. We start
to play the game Universe, which requires absolute integrity.
You start with 12 alternate
directions and multibillions of frequency options for
your first move and from that move
you have again the same multioptions at each of your
successive moves. The number of
moves that can be made is unlimited, but the moves must
always be made in absolute

 The game of Universe is like chess with 92 unique
men, each of which has
four different frequencies available, and it works on
12 degrees of freedom instead of a
planar checkerboard. The vector equilibrium becomes
the omnidirectional checker frame
and you can change the frequencies to suit conditions.
But you must observe and obey the
complexity of mass attraction and the critical proximity
between precessing and falling in.
And there are also electromagnetic attractions and repulsions
built into the game.

 In order to be able to think both finitely and comprehensively,
in terms of
total systems, we have to start off with Universe itself.
We must include all the universal
degrees of freedom. Though containing the frequently
irrational and uneconomic XYZ
dimensional relationships, Universe does not employ
the three-dimensional frame of
reference in its ever-most-economical, omnirational,
coordinate-system transactions.
Nature does not use rectilinear coordination in its
continual intertransforming. Nature
coordinates in 12 alternatively equieconomical degrees
of freedom<SUP>&#95;&#95;</SUP>six positive and six
negative. For this reason! 12 is the minimum number
of spokes you must have in a wire
wheel in order to make a comprehensive structural integrity
of that tool. You must have
six positive and six negative spokes to offset all polar
or equatorial diaphragming and
torque. (See illustration <A HREF="../s06/p4000.html#640.40">640.40</A>.)

always employs
only the most economical intertransformative and omnicosmic
interrelatedness behavioral
stratagems. With each and every event in Universe-no
matter how frequently recurrent-
there are always 12 unique, equieconomical, omnidirectionally
operative, alternate-action
options, which 12 occur as four sets of three always

with each high frequency of recurring

 All the aspects of the constant relative abundances
of points, areas, and lines
are divisible by two: four faces, four points, and six
edge lines. Thus there are six vectorial
moves for every event; each of the vectorial moves is
reversible, hence 12. Positional
differentials in Universe derive only from the sixness
of the 12 degrees of freedom.

 Each of the six positive and six negative energy lines
impinging on every
nonpolarized point ("focal event") in Universe has a
unique and symmetrical continuation
beyond that point. The six positive and six negative
vectors are symmetrically arrayed

are inherently centers of a local and

negative degrees of

alternate ways in which nature
can behave most economically upon each and every energy-event

 <B>Six Vectors for Every Point:</B> The behavioral interpatterning
frame of
reference of the six degrees of freedom in respect to
omnidirectionality is of course the
vector equilibrium, which embraces the three-dimensionality
of the cube and the six-
dimensionality of the vector equilibrium. Experience
is inherently omnidirectional; ergo,
there is always a minimum of 12 "others" in respect
to the nuclear observing self. The 24-
positive- and 24-negative-vectored vector equilibrium
demonstrates an initially
frequenced, tetrahedrally quantized unity of 20; ergo,
the Universe, as an aggregate of all
humanity's apprehended and comprehended experiences,
is at minimum a plurality of 24
vectors. (See Secs. <A HREF="../s09/p7120.html#981.12">981.12</A>

 A basic event consists of three vectorial lines: the
action, the reaction, and
the resultant. This is the fundamental tripartite component
of Universe. One positive and
one negative event together make one tetrahedron, or
one quantum. The number of
vectors (or force lines) cohering each and every subsystem
of Universe is always a number
subdivisible by six, i.e., consisting of one positive
and one negative event on each of three
vectors, which adds up to six. This holds true topologically
in all abstract patterning in
Universe as well as in fundamental physics. The six
vectors represent the fundamental six,
and only six, degrees of freedom in Universe. Each of
these six, however, has a positive
and a negative direction, and we can therefore speak
of a total of 12 degrees of freedom.
These 12 degrees of freedom can be conceptually visua!ized
as the radial lines connecting
the centers of gravity of the 12 spheres, closest packed
around one sphere, to the center of
gravity of that central sphere. The 12 degrees of freedom
are also identified by the push-
pull alternative directions of the tetrahedron's six
edges.

 Spheres in closest packing are high-tide aspects of
vertexes. It is easy to be
misled into thinking that there are no lines involved
when you see two spheres in tangency,
because the lines are hidden inside the spheres and
between the points of tangency. And if
you do realize that there is a force line between the
two spheres' centers, you could
assume that there is only one line between the two.
This is where you see that unity is two,
because the line breaks itself into radii of the two
spheres.

 The 12 universal degrees of freedom govern the external
and internal
motions of all independent systems in Universe. In order
to take synergetic strategy
advantage and thereby to think comprehensively and anticipatorily,
in terms of total
systems, we have to start off with Universe itself as
a closed finite system that misses none
of the factors. We must also include all the universal
degrees of freedom, and the
approximately unlimited range of frequencies in the
use thereof, which cover all variable
interrelationships of Universe. They become the controlling
factors governing general
systems and, thereby govern such supercomplex systems
design as that of a nation's navy
or a fundamental program for comprehensively considerate
and efficiently effective use of
all world resources. The general systems approach starts
with the differentiation of
Universe, including both metaphysical and physical,
and permits progressive subdivisions
in cybernetical bits to bring any local pattern of any
problem into its identification within
the total scheme of generalized system events. Problem
solving starts with Universe and
thereafter subdivides by progressively discarding irrelevancies
thereby to identify the
"critical path" priorities and order of overlapping
developments that will most
economically and efficiently and expeditiously realize
the problem's solution by special
local problem identification and location within the
totality of the problem-solving
scenario.

 Because of our overspecialization and our narrow electromagnetic
spectrum
range of our vision, we have very limited integrated
comprehension of the significance of
total information. For this reason, we see and comprehend
very few motions among the
vast inventory of unique motions and transformation
developments of Universe. Universe
is a nonsimultaneous complex of unique motions and transformations.
Of course, we do
not "see" and our eyes cannot "stop" the 186,000-miles-per-second
kind of motion. We
do not see the atomic motion. We do not even see the
stars in motion, though they move
at speeds of over a million miles per day. We do not
see the tree's or child's moment-to-
moment growth. We do not even see the hands of a clock
in motion. We remember where
the hands of a clock were when we last looked and thus
we accredit that motion has
occurred. In fact, experiment shows that we see and
comprehend very little of the totality
of motions.

 Therefore, society tends to think statically and is
always being surprised,
often uncomfortably, sometimes fatally by the omni-inexorable
motion of Universe.
Lacking dynamic apprehension, it is difficult for humanity
to get out of its static fixations
and to see great trends evolving. Just now, man is coming
into technical discovery of
general systems theory. The experimental probing of
the potentials of the computers
awakened man to a realization of the vast complexes
of variables that can be mastered by
general systems theory. So far, man has dealt but meagerly
and noncomprehensively with
his powerful planning capability. So far, he has employed
only limited systems theory in
special open-edged systems<SUP>&#95;&#95;</SUP>"tic-tac-toe" rectilinear
grid systems and planar matrixes.
The arbitrary open parameters of infinite systems can
never be guaranteed to be adequate
statements of all possible variables. Infinite systems
engender an infinite number of
variable factors. Unless one starts with Universe, one
always inadvertently starts with
open infinite systems. Only by starting with finite
Universe and progressively dismissing
finite irrelevancies can one initiate finite, locally
limited, general systems theory to assured
satisfaction in problem solving.

 We may define the individual as one way the game of
Universe could have
eventuated to date. Universe is the omnidirectional,
omnifrequency game of chess in which
with each turn of the play there are 12 vectorial degrees
of freedom: six positive and six
negative moves to be made. This is a phenomenon of frequencies
and periodicities. Each
individual is a complete game of Universe from beginning
to end. This is why each of us
individuals is so much alike and yet completely different,
a unique and individual way of
playing the game with each of the omnidirectional degrees
of freedom. With the six
positive and the six negative omnidirectional degrees-of-freedom
moves to be made at
each turn of the play, the individual can move to any
cosmic point that is not occupied and
can move back over the same points or move on to new
ones. (See Fig. <A HREF="p3700.html#537.10">537.10</A>.) Intellect
as "god" can play all these incredibly different games
in all these different ways and at all

 We regard each individual as the special case, but
consciousness as the
generalization. Like the bumper sticker, "The Real World
is Special Case." Reality is
special case. You and I are sitting here, and no one
else can be sitting right where we are.
This is the kind of reality that the newspapers miss:
they write about reality as if we were
all the same realities, as if we were all the same things.
If you and I are sitting here, we
couldn't possibly be anywhere else.

 There are many different realities. This is the difference
between reality and
generalization. There is only one generalization. The
only reason the radio works is that it
has no interference. The game of Universe can be played
on any one of the fantastically
large number of the quadrillions of quadrillions of
frequencies: the game can be played any
way just so long as there is no interference on the
frequency you are using, so long as
there are not two pieces in the same vector equilibrium
at the same time.

 What is important about the individual and important
about the Universe is
that neither is exempt from any of the rules. Universe
is the sumtotal, and the individual is
the special case. Universe is the aggregate of all the
generalized principles. Each individual
is one of the illions of ways the game of Universe could
be played.

 I think I tend to avoid using the word <I>will</I> because
I spontaneously associate
it with the term "free will" and all the controversies
regarding the history of such human
beliefs. I have felt that all such controversies lack
adequate knowledge of science's
generalized laws. To me it is obvious that no amount
of individual will can nullify any
cosmic law. It is also obvious to me that few know of
and comprehend the significance of
nature's having six positive and six negative equieconomical
alternative moves to make
with each turn to play in cosmic events.

realizable when mind is
adequately convinced regarding which of the 12 alternatives

 Nature's probability is not linear or planar, but
the mathematical models with
which it is treated today are almost exclusively linear.
Real Universe probability
accommodates the omnidirectional, interaccommodative
transformating transactions of
universal events, which humanity identifies superficially
as environment. Probability
articulates locally in Universe in response to the organically
integral, generalized,
omnidirectional <I>in, out, inside out, outside in,</I> and
<I>around</I> events of the self-system as well
as with the selfsystem's extraorganic travel and externally
imposed processing around and
amongst the inwardly and outwardly contiguous forces
of the considered system as
imposed by both its synchronously and contiguously critically
near macrocosmic and

 Synergetics, by relating energy and topology to the

systems, as defined by its synergetic hierarchy, replaces
randomness with a rational

 I am tying up the social experience, often observed,
in which three
independently and consistently velocitied automobiles
(and only three) come into close
proximity on the highway<SUP>&#95;&#95;</SUP>often with no other cars in
sight. Mathematically speaking,
three points<SUP>&#95;&#95;</SUP>and only three<SUP>&#95;&#95;</SUP>define both a plane and
a triangle. The cars make a triangle;
and because it is mathematically discovered that the
total number of points, or areas, or
lines of a system are always even numbers; and that
this divisibility by two accommodates
the polar-and-hemispherical positive-negativeness of
all systems; and because the defining
of one small triangle on the surface of a system always
inadvertently defines a large
triangle representing the remainder of the whole system's
surface; and this large triangle's
corners will always be more than 180 degrees each; ergo,
the triangle is an "inside-out,"
i.e., negative, triangle; and to convert it to positive
condition requires halving or otherwise
fractionating each of its three corners by great circle
lines running together somewhere
within the great negative triangle; thus there develops
a minimum of four positive triangles
embracing the Earth induced by such three-car convergences.

 The triangle made by the three cars is a complementarity
of the three other
spherical triangles on the Earth's surface. The triangle
formed by the two cars going one
way, and one the other way, gets smaller and smaller
and then reverses itself, getting ever
larger. There is always a closer proximity between two
of the three. This is all governed by
topological "pattern integrity. "

 Probability is exclusively abstract mathematics: theoretically
calculated
points on curves. The statisticians think almost exclusively
in lines or planes; they are what
I call planilinear. Willard Gibbs in evolving his phase
rule was engaged in probability
relating to chemistry when he inadvenently and intuitively
conceived of his phase rule for
explaining the number of energetic freedoms necessary
to introduce into a system,
complexedly constituted of crystals, liquids, and gases,
in order to unlock them into a
common state of liquidity. His discovered phase rule
and topology are the same: they are
both synergetic. Despite the synergetic work of such
pioneers as Euler and Gibbs, all the
different chemistries and topologies still seem to be
random. But synergetics, by relating
energy and topology to the tetrahedron, and to systems
as defined, and by its synergetic
hierarchy, replaces randomness with a rational cosmic,
shape-and-structural-system
hierarchy. This hierarchy discloses a constant relative
abundance of the constituents; i.e.,
for every nonpolar point there are always two faces
and three edges. But systems occur
only as defined by four points. Prime structural systems
are inherently tetrahedral, as is
also the quantum.

 A social experience of three cars: they make a triangle
changing from scalene
to equilateral to scalene. The triangles are where the
cars don't hit. (These are simply the
windows.) But you can't draw less than four triangles.
The complementarity of the three
triangles makes the spherical tetrahedron<SUP>&#95;&#95;</SUP>which makes
the three-way grid. The little
spherical triangle window is visible to human observers
in greatest magnitude of human
observability and awareness of such three-car triangles
at 15 miles distance, which is 15
minutes of spherical arc of our Earth. Such dynamically
defined Earth triangulation is not a
static grid, because the lines do not go through the
same point at the same time;
lines<SUP>&#95;&#95;</SUP>which are always action trajectories<SUP>&#95;&#95;</SUP>never do.
All we have is patterning integrity
of critical proximities. There is always a nonviolated
intervening boundary condition. This
is all that nature ever has.

 Nature modulates probability and the degrees of freedom,
i.e., frequency and
angle, leading to the tensegrity sphere; which leads
to the pneumatic bag; all of which are
the same kind of reality as the three automobiles. All
the cosmic triangling of all the
variety of angles always averages out to 60 degrees.
That is the probability of all closed
systems, of which the Universe is the amorphous largest
case. Probability is not linear or
planar, but it is always following the laws of sphericity
or whole systems. Probability is
always dependent upon critical proximity, omnidirectional,
and only dynamically defined
three-way gridding pattern integrity, and with the concomitant
topologically constant
relative abundance of points, areas, and lines, all
governed in an orderly way by low-order,
prime-number, behavioral uniqueness as disclosed by
synergetics.
