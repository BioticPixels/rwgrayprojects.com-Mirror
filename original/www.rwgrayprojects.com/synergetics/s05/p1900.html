 What we really mean by a point is an unresolved definition
of an activity. A
point by itself does not enclose. There are no indivisible
points.

 Without insideness, there is no outsideness; and without
either insideness or
outsideness, there is only a locus fix. Ergo, "points"
are inherently nondemonstrable, and
the phenomena accommodated by the packaged word <I>point</I>
will always prove to be a focal
center of differentiating events. A locus fix constitutes
conceptual genesis that may be
realized in time. Any conceptual event in Universe must
have insideness and outsideness.
This is a fundamentally self-organizing principle.

 Points are complex but only as yet nondifferentiably
resolvable by superficial
inspection. A star is something you cannot resolve.
We call it a point, playing Euler's
game of crossings. One locus fix does not have an insideness
and an outsideness. It takes
four to define insideness and outsideness. It is called
a point only because you cannot
resolve it. Two remotely crossing trajectories have
no insideness or outsideness, but do
produce optically observable crossings, or locus fixes,
that are positionally alterable in
respect to a plurality of observation points. A point's
definitively unresolved event
relationships inherently embrace potential definitions
of a complex of local events. When
concentrically and convergently resolved, the "point"
proves to be the "center" <SUP>&#95;&#95;</SUP>the zero
moment of transition from going inwardly and going outwardly.

 Physical points are energy-event aggregations. When
they converge beyond
the critical fall-in proximity threshold, they orbit
coordinatedly, as a Universe-precessed
aggregate, as loose pebbles on our Earth orbit the Sun
in unison, and as chips ride around
on men's shoulders. A "point" often means "locus of
inflection" when we go beyond the
threshold of critical proximity and the <I>inness</I> proclivity
prevails, in contradistinction to the
differentiable other fallen-in aggregates orbiting precessionally
in only mass-attractively
cohered remoteness outwardly beyond the critical-proximity
threshold.

 As with coil springs, in tensors and vectors of equal
magnitude, the
spiralinearity of the vector is shorter in overall spatial
extent than is the spiralinearity of
the tensor. Compressed lines or rods tend to arcs of
diminishing radius; tensed lines or
rods tend to arcs of increasing radius.

unity as plural and minimum two. Awareness begins with
two. This is where epistemology

 Galileo's parallelogram of forces is inadequate to
account for resultants
other than in the special-case, one-plane, billiard-table
situation. Force vectors must

 When we vector the course of one ship on a collision
course with a second
ship, the resultant of forces in Galileo's diagram would
have them waltzing off together
some 12 miles to the north-northeast. But all sane men
can see such behavior is just what
ships do not display after a collision. One of the two
ships colliding on the wavy surface of
spherical Earth may go a few hundred feet in the direction
of Galileo's resultant of forces,
but not 12 miles. But the other one probably goes in
toward the center of Earth<SUP>&#95;&#95;</SUP>which
isn't in the diagram at all.

 When ships run into each other, they actually first
rise outwardly from
Earth's center because in acceleration both were trying
to leave Earth. (If they could
accelerate faster, like rockets, they would leave Earth.)
In reality, there are four forces
operating. Two rise outwardly against gravity, accelerating
conically together before they
subside, when one or both go to the bottom. In addition
to the vector for each ship, there
is gravity plus the resultant. We are operating omnidimensionally,
and this is what the
minimum set of forces is. The pattern of force lines
looks very much like a music stand:
three vectorial legs spread out with a fourth vertical
vector. (See

 The so-called pure mathematician's straight line must
be the "impossible"; it
must be <I>instantly infinite</I> in two infinitely remote
opposite directions. All of its parts must
be absolutely, uniformly nothing and simultaneously
manifest as discretely, and infinitely
divisible, increments. It may not be generated progressively
or drawn physically, in time,
as an experimentally produced action trajectory of one
system modifying another.
Microscopic inspection of the impressed, graven, deposited,
or left-behind trails of all
physical Universe's action trajectories always discloses
a complex of gross, noninfinite,
nonstraight, non-equal-magnitude irregularities. Progressively
closer inspections of
experimentally attempted demonstrations by pure mathematicians
of their allegedly
"straight" lines disclose increasingly volumetric aberration
and angular digressions from
straightness.

 The deliberately nonstraight line of synergetics employs
the mathematicians'
own invention for dealing with great dilemmas: the strategy
of reductio ad absurdum.
Having moments of great frustration, the mathematician
learned to forsake looking for
local logic; he learned to go in the opposite direction
and deliberately to choose the most
absurd. And then, by progressively eliminating the degrees
of absurdity, he could work
back to the not too absurd. In hunting terms, we call
this <I>quarrying</I> his objective. Thus he
is able at least to learn where his quarry is within
a small area.

 To develop methodically a very much less crooked line
than that of
conventional geometry, we start to produce our deliberately
nonstraight line by taking a
simple piece of obviously twisted rope. We will use
Dacron, which is nonstretchable
(nylon will stretch, and manila is very offensively
stretchable). We then take the two ends
of our rope and splice them into each other to form
a loop. This immediately contradicts
the definition of a straight line, which is that it
never returns upon itself. We can take the
two parts of the rope loop that are approximately parallel
to one another and hold these
two parts in our hands. We may call this pairing. Holding
one hand on one of the pairs, we
can slide the rope on the other hand, continually pairing
it away from the point of first
pairing. As we massage the two parts along, our hand
finally gets to where the rope comes
into a very sharp little loop and turns to come back
on itself. We can hold it very tight at
this point and put a little ribbon on the bend, the
arch where it bends itself back. Sliding
our hands the other way, holding and sliding, holding
and sliding, massaging the rope
together, we come to the other looping point and carefully
put a ribbon marker in the bend
of the arch. Having carefully made a rope that returns
upon itself, we have now divided
unity into two approximately equal halves.

 Heisenberg makes it experientially clear that we cannot
be absolutely exact.
The act of measuring alters that which is measured.
But with care we can be confident that
we have two experiencially satisfactory halves of the
total rope circuit existing between
our two ribbon markers. Proceeding further, we can bring
the ribbon-marked, half-points
together, thus to divide the rope into four equal parts
of unity. We can separately halve
each of those quarter-lengths of the rope's closed-circuit
unity to produce one-eighth
unity length, while avoiding compounding of error. Each
time we halve a local fraction,
we halve any residual error. We can evenly subdivide
our deliberately nonstraight line into
as many small fractions as may be desirable.

 We now ask four friends each to take hold of a half-
or a quarter-point in the
rope, and then ask them to walk away from each other
until the rope unity is taut. We ask
them to lower their four-sided geometrical figure to
the floor and ask another friend to
drive nails into the floor inside the four tightly stretched
corners of the rope. A diamond
rope pattern is thus produced with its corners marked
A, B, C, and D. We are provided
with plenty of proofs about equilateral parallelograms;
we know that if the sides are equal
in length, we can assume them to be approximately parallel
because the wall we have
nailed them to is an approximate plane. It may be pretty
rough as the mathematicians talk
about planes, but it is nonetheless a satisfactory plane
for our purposes.

 We next put in more nails in the floor at the ribbon-marked
eighth points. C
is the right-hand corner of the diamond, and D is the
top of the diamond. We can call the
bottom half of the diamond a V, and we can call the
top half of the diamond a lambda.
Putting nails at the one-eighth points means that halfway
down from A to B there is a nail
and halfway from B upward to C there is a nail. Halfway
from C upward to D we put a
nail at the eighth point. Then halfway down from D back
to A again we put another nail at
the eighth point. We then take the rope off D and place
it over those one-eighth nails. The
rope now changes from a <I>lambda</I> pattern into an "M" form.
Because it is an equilateral
parallelogram, we know that the new middle loop must
be at the center of the diamond.
We place a nail at this center of the diamond and mark
it O. We next go from C, which is
at the extreme right-hand corner of the diamond, down
to take the rope off B. Taking the
rope off the V (which used to be ABC), we convert the
V to a W<SUP>&#95;&#95;</SUP>with the bottom points
of the W at the one-eighth-point nails. We then move
the rope off B and up to the center
of the diamond also. This gives us two diamonds, two
little diamonds strung end-to-end
together at the center of the big diamond. Their extreme
ends are at A and C. Because we
know that these are all equilateral parallelograms,
we know that the length of the new
letter M is the same as the length of the new letter
W. We can now give these new one-
eighth points the designations E, F, G, and H. So it
now reads AHOGC and AEOFC. And
we have two beautiful diamonds.

 From now on, all we have to do is convert each of
these diamonds in the
same manner into two smaller ones. We convert the two
diamonds into four. And then the
four into eight. And the eight into 16. But the chain
of diamonds always remains A<SUP>&#95;&#95;</SUP>C in
overall length. Both the altitudes and lengths of the
diamonds are continually halving; thus
what we are doing is simply increasing the frequency
of the modular subdivision of the
original unity of the rope. As the frequency of the
wavelike subdivisions is multiplied, the
deliberately nonstraight line approaches contractively
toward straight behaviors. The rope
remains exactly the same length, but its two parts are
getting closer and closer to one
another. The plane of the floor is really an illusion.
As we get to a very high frequency of
diamonds, we realize that instead of doing it the way
we did, we could simply have twisted
the original rope so that it would be a series of spirals
of the same number as that of the
chain of diamonds. We look at the profile of the rope
and realize that all we are seeing is
twice as many twists every time<SUP>&#95;&#95;</SUP>at every progression.
This gives us a very intimate
concept of what actually happens in wave phenomena.

 The old-fashioned physicist used to put one nail in
the wall, fasten a rope to
it, and stand back and throw a whip into the rope. The
whip goes to the nail on the wall
and then comes back to his hand and stops. That is the
prime characteristic of waves. They
always make a complete cycle. That is why, for instance,
gears are always whole circles. A
gear is a fundamental wave phenomenon. Electromagnetic
waves always close back upon
themselves. Deliberately nonstraight lines are round-trip
circuits.

 Our deliberately nonstraight-line model provides us
whatever frequency of
modular subdivision we want in unity, which is the cycle.
This is what we mean by
frequency of modular subdivision, whether unity is a
sphere or a circle. What is going on
in our rope, the way we have handled it, we make it
into unity as a cycle. We see these
waves going in a round-trip trajectory pattern from
A to the extreme point C and back
again to A. The overall distance traveled by any of
the routes remains the same. So what
we see on the floor or in the diamond chain diagram
is a true model of basic wave
phenomena. As we double the frequency and halve the
wavelength of positive and
negative waves, we swiftly arrive at a visibly far less
crooked condition and approach
relative straightness. We can see quite clearly that
we do not have to increase the
subdividing of those diamonds many times before they
tend to look like a straight line as
far as your eye and my eye can see. This concept agrees
elegantly with fundamental wave
theory as predicated on electromagnetic experimentation.

 For instance, on an engineer's scale you and I can
see 50 divisions of an
inch. We can see l/50th of an inch, but 1/100th of an
inch goes gray and blurred. When we
get to where an inch of the deliberately nonstraight
line has more than 100 subdivisions, it
looks like an absolutely straight line. When we get
into the kinds of frequencies that
characterize light waves, we get into very, very high
numbers, and we can understand that
what we call a line of sight has become so thin that
it is invisible altogether. So we can
understand that when the mathematician asked for a line
of sight, which felt so good to
him, he was asking for something that is really very
beautifully imaginary. It was always a
deliberately nonstraight line.

 All experiments show that with ever closer inspections,
the mathematicians'
"straight" lines become obviously ever less straight.
On the other hand, the quasi-straight
line, which is demonstrated here as the deliberately
nonstraight line, does get progressively
straighter. Tending toward a greater straightness than
that which is physically
demonstrable, the deliberately nonstraight line thus
serves all the finite geometries
heretofore employed schematically by the mathematicians'
alleged but unprovable straight
lines, i.e., to demonstrate proof of the Euclidian and
non-Euclidian geometrical
propositions.

 "Lines of sight" taken with transits are truer than
string lines or penciled
lines. Sight approaches "straight" behaviors. Lines
of sight are high-frequency energy-
wave interactions. Because the truest lines of sight
are energy-wave quanta, they are
always finite. The mathematician might say, "Oh, I mean
a much straighter line than you
can draw, I mean as straight and intangible as a line
of sight." Then you remind the
mathematician that when you have your transit's telescope
focused on the "kissing point,"
as Earth's horizon becomes tangent to Sun's disc at
daylight's end, you must remember
that it takes eight minutes for the light to reach us
from the Sun. Wherefore, the Sun has
not been there for eight minutes, and you must admit
that you are "seeing" the Sun around
and beyond the horizon, which proves that your "line
of sight" is curved, not straight. Due
to the lag in the speed of light, Sun has not been there
in a direct line of sight for eight
minutes, so you are looking around the horizon through
a curved "pipe" of light. This is
what Einstein referred to as curved space.

 To provide a more accurate identity of the only apparently
straight-line
phenomenon that the pure mathematician had erroneously
thought of as "the shortest
distance between two points," Einstein reinvoked the

 To comprehend and apprehend experimentally such "most
economic
relationships," all that you need do is to attempt to
hit a flying object with a bullet fired by
you from a gun. If you fire at the flying object where
it is at the moment you fire, you will
not hit it. You must fire at where you figure it is
going to be at a later moment when it
would most probably collide with your bullet. Gravity
will start curving your bullet toward
Earth as soon as it leaves your gun. The amount of curvature
may be imperceptible to you,
but it is easily detected by using a camera and a tracer
firing charge. The air is always in
motion, and your bullet will corkscrew ever so mildly
between you and the flying object.
This corkscrewing of the geodesic line, which is the
most economical time-distance-effort
relationship between the gun, the firer, and the flying
object he hits, is dramatically shown
in night photography of dogfights of World-War-II airplanes
firing machine-gun tracer
bullets at one another, with one being hit while the
photographs are taken by a third plane
flying in close vicinity of the dogfight.

 Once you state what your realistic optimum recognition
of totality consists
of, then you find how many bits or subdivision stages
it will take to isolate any items
within that totality. It is like the childhood game
of Twenty Questions: You start by
saying, "Is it physical or metaphysical?" Next: "Is
it animate or inanimate?" (One <I>bit.</I>) "Is
it big or little?" (Two <I>bits.</I>) "Is it hot or cold?"
(Three <I>bits.</I>) It takes only a few bits to find
out what you want. When we use bit subdivision to ferret
out the components of our
problems, we do exactly what the computer is designed
to do. The computer's mechanism
consists of simple go-no go, of yes and no circuit valves,
or binary mathematics valves.
We keep "halving" the halves of Universe until we refine
out the desired <I>bit.</I> In four
halvings, you have eliminated 94 percent of irrelevant
Universe. In seven halvings, you
have removed 99.2 percent of irrelevant Universe. Operating

 In a structural system, the number of vertexes is
always divisible by four and
the number of triangle edges is always divisible by
six. Edges and vertexes do not come

redundant.
