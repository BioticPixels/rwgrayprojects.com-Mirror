 The greatest of all the faculties is the ability of
the imagination to formulate
conceptually. Conceptuality is subjective; realization
is objective. Conceptuality is
metaphysical and weightless; reality is physical.

 Definition requires conceptuality. All local systems
are conceptual.
Conceptual totality is inherently prohibited. There
is systematic conceptuality within the
totality, but it is always cosmically partial.

 The artist was right all the time. Nature is conceptual.
This is the difference
between visibility and invisibility. The invisible does
not mean nonconceptual.
Conceptuality is independent of visibility or invisibility.
You can have conceptuality, or an
understanding of the principles, independent of size,
which makes it possible to conceive
of events as they occur at magnitudes that would be
subvisible or supravisible.
Conceptuality operates experimentally, independent of
size. Size alone can come to zero,
not conceptuality.

 We may think conceptually of assemblies of triangles
or basic, generalized,
structural arrangements that will hold true at either
an atomic-nucleus size or a super-
galaxy size, because all angularly defined systems are
conceptually independent of the
relative sizes of special-case experiences.

 There is no half-profile of you. All conceptuality
is systemic; it has to be
finitely closed. Conceptuality has to have both frequency

 The difference between nonconceptual, nonsimultaneous
Universe and
<I>thinkability</I> is always two tetrahedra: one as macro,
to complete the convex localness
outside the system, and one as micro, to complete the
concave localness inside the system,
to add up to finite but nonconceptual Universe. Thus
the thinkable system takeout from
Universe has a "left-out" outside irrelevancy tetrahedron
and a "left-in" inside irrelevancy
tetrahedron.

 You have to have the starkly nonvisible to provide
the complementary
tetrahedron to account for the visibility, since concave
and convex are not the same. That
stark invisible reality of the nonconceptual macro-
and micro-tetrahedra also have to have
this 720-degree elegance. But the invisible outside
tetrahedron was equally stark. The
finite but nonconceptual inness and outness: that is
the Omnidirectional Halo.

 Complementarity requires that where there is conceptuality,
there must be
nonconceptuality. The explicable requires the inexplicable.
Experience requires the
nonexperienceable. The obvious requires the mystical.
This is a powerful group of paired
concepts generated by the complementarity of conceptuality.
Ergo, we can have
annihilation and yet have no energy lost; it is only
locally lost.

 By the same logic a triangle or three-angled polygon
is not only thinkably
conceptual independent of size, but all its lines also
terminate in angular convergences.
Ergo, the triangle has no loose ends; the triangle is
integrally and comprehensively finite.
The triangle demonstrates finite conceptuality independent

 The relative size of any phenomenon is measurable
only in time, for it takes
time to measure. The relative magnitudes or microtudes
of phenomena are measurable in
equal, elapsed-time-per-whole-cycle increments relative
to a specified cyclic system. (See
Secs. <A HREF="../s02/p5000.html#265.08">265.08</A>
through <A HREF="../s02/p5000.html#265.13">265.13</A>,

<A HREF="../s10/p33180.html#1033.601">1033.601</A>.)
The prime time increments and
their respective frequency of recurrence within specific
cyclic periods as employed by
science are those of the only-gravitationally-intercohered
galactic and nuclear systems.
The celestial galaxies and the atomic nuclei alike are
axially and orbitally unrestrained
angular momentums of independently operative energy
substances. The relative
frequencies of the macrocelestial and microatomic systems
and their local, individual,
integral, inwardly-outwardly-pulsative, intertransforming
characteristics have been reliably
and informedly measured and interreferenced to constitute
the cosmic timetable of cyclic
events.

 Experience is always special case but always governed
by generalized laws.
Among the generalized laws governing experience is the
law that there are three
directional aspects of all experience: in, out, and
around. These directions manifest an
inward-outward pulsing and a surface-articulated patterning.
The pulsing patterning has
six consequences:
<OL TYPE="1">
<LI>the change in size wave frequency;
<LI>the plurality of precessionally induced surface
vertex-vortex rotations of the
expansive-contractive pulsations acting as omninonpolar
vertex, alternately
winding and unwinding, alternately and symmetrically
to take in the slack of
the contracting system or unwinding locally to permit
symmetrical expansion;
<LI>the inherent axial rotation of the whole system;
<LI>the inherent orbitally occasioned surface changings
occasioned by external
forces operating precessionally upon the conceptual
system considered;
<LI>the precessionally induced inside-outing transformations;
and
<LI>the local-surface spiral wrinklings caused by axial
torque; i.e., when opposite
poles rotate in opposite directions (as with the Earth's
clockwise rotation of
high-pressure, clear-weather atmospheric motions and
the counterclockwise,
spirally wrinkled, cloud-cover pattern of the low-pressure
stormy weather in
the Northern Hemisphere and the oppositely spiraling
behaviors in the
Southern Hemisphere in respect to the same fair and
stormy weather
conditions).

 Certainly, my experience and your experience includes
the fact that we
dream. This doesn't have to be realized reality. There
may be people who lie to you, but
manipulation of the data doesn't alter your determination
to rely upon experience, for it
now becomes a part of your experience that some people
lie, and you learn which ones are
reliable as suppliers of your experience inventorying.
Our experience includes the

 Since experience is finite, it can be stored, studied,
directed, and turned with
conscious effort to human advantage. This means that
evolution pivots on the conscious,
selective use of cumulative human experience and not
on Darwin's hypothesis of chance
adaptation to survival nor on his assumption of evolution
independent of individual will

 Consciousness is experience. Experience is complex
consciousness of being,
of self coexisting with all the nonself. Experience
is plural and nonsimultaneous.
Experience is recurrent consciousness of sequences of
self reexperiencing similar events.
Reexperienced consciousness is recognition. Re-cognitions
generate identifications. Re-
cognition of within-self rhythms of heartbeat or other
identities generates a matrix
continuum of time consciousness upon which, as on blank
music lines, are superimposed
all the observances by self of the nonself occurrences.

 Experience is inherently omnidirectional; ergo, there
is not just one "other."
There are always at least twelve "others." The connection
between the six degrees of
freedom and omnidirectionality is, of course, the vector
equilibrium. Pulsation in the
vector equilibrium is the nearest thing we will ever
know to eternity and god: the
zerophase of conceptual integrity inherent in the positive
and negative asymmetries that
propagate the problems of consciousness evolution. Our
inherently limited perceptivity
requires these definitions of the asymmetric emphasis
of experience. Experience is
inherently terminal, partial, and differentiable: the
antithesis of eternal integrity

 The difference between synergetics and conventional
mathematics is that it is
derived from experience and is always considerate of
experience, whereas conventional
mathematics is based upon "axioms" that were imaginatively
conceived and that were
inconsiderate of information progressively harvested
through microscopes, telescopes, and
electronic probings into the nonsensorially tunable
ranges of the electromagnetic
spectrum. Whereas <I>solids, straight lines, continuous
surfaces,</I> and <I>infinity</I> seemed
imaginatively obvious, i.e., axiomatic; physics has
discovered none of the foregoing to be
experimentally demonstrable. The imaginary "abstraction"
was so logical, valid, and
obviously nonsolid, nonsubstantial in the preinstrumentally-informed
history of the
musings of man that the mathematician assumed abstraction
to be systemic conceptuality,
i.e., metaphysical absolutely devoid of experience:
He began with oversight.

 In speaking of his "purely imaginary straight line,"
the mathematician uses
four words, all of which were invented by man to accommodate
his need to communicate
his experience to self or others:
<OL TYPE="a">
<LI><I>Purely:</I> This word comes from the relativity of man's
experiences in relation
to impurities or "undesirable presences."
<LI><I>Imaginary:</I> "Image-inary" means man's communication
of what he thinks it is
that he thinks his brain is doing with the objects of
his experience. His
discovery of general conceptual principles characterizing
all of his several
experiences<SUP>&#95;&#95;</SUP>as the rock having insideness and outsideness,
the many pebbles
having their corners knocked off and developing roundness<SUP>&#95;&#95;</SUP>means
that there
could be pure "roundness" and thus he imagined a perfect
sphere.
<LI><I>Straight: </I>Man's experiences with curvilinear paths
suggested that the
waviness could be reduced to straightness, but there
was naught in his
experience to validate that nonexperienced assumption.
Physics finds only
waves. Some are of exquisitely high frequency, but inherently
discontinuous
because consisting of separate event packages. They
are oscillating to and
from negative Universe, that is to say, in pulsation.
<LI><I>Line:</I> Line is a <I>leading,</I> the description of man's
continual discovery of the
angularly observable directional sequences of events.
Lines are trajectories or
traceries of event happenings in respect to the environmental
events of the
event happening.

 A voluntary experience is an <I>experiment.</I> To be experimental,
we must have
an observer and the observed, the articulator and the
articulated. Experiences include
experiments: there are experimentally demonstrable cyclic
regularities, such as frequencies
of the occurrence of radiation emissions of various
atomic isotopes, which become the
fundamental time increment references of relative size
measurement of elemental
phenomena.

 Happenings contradict probability. That's why they
are happenings.
Probability is not a reliable anticipatory tool; it
is stronger than "possibility" but crude in
comparison to "navigation" and "astronomy." If probability
