<TR><TD>Fig. 522.09 The Deliberately Nonstraight Line: Quasi-"straight"
lines: ABCDA = unit wave;
AEOFCGOHA = ABCDA. As we double the frequency and halve
the wavelength of positive and negative
waves, we approach relative straightness: proof that
two deliberately nonstraight lines between points A
and C approach relative straightness to more effective
degree than attainable by an assumed straight
construction.
