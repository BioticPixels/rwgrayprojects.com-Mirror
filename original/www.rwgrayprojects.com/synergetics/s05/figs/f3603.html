<TR><TD>Fig. 536.03 Domains of Vertexes, Faces, and Edges of
Systems:
<OL TYPE="A">
<LI> The domain of the vertex of a system: the domain
of each vertex of the icosahedron is a pentagon
whose edges connect the centers of gravity of five icosahedron
face triangles. The resulting figure is the
pentagonal dodecahedron.
<LI> The domain of the face of a system: The domain of
each face of the icosahedron is the triangular face
itself.
<LI> The domain of the edge of a system: The domain of
each edge of the icosahedron is a diamond formed
by connecting the vertexes of two adjacent icosahedron
face triangles with their centers of gravity.
