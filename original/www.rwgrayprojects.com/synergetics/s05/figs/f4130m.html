<TR><TD>Fig. 541.30M  Gradually the four tetrahedron-defining,
vertexial components of the photon package's spiralling
results in an equilibrium-seeking interaction of their four
separate interattractions, which generates the four great
circles of the vector equilibrium and establishes its tactical
energy center as the four planes of the zerophase tetrahedron.
