 Because there are no experimentally known "continuums,"
we cannot concede
validity to the concept of continuous "surfaces" or
of continuous "solids." The
dimensional characteristics we used to refer to as "areas"
and "volumes," which are
always the <I>second-</I> and <I>third-</I>power values of linear
increments, we can now identify
experimentally, arithmetically, and geometrically only
as quantum units that aggregate as
points, both in system-embracing areal aggregates and
within systems as volume-occupant
aggregates. The areal and volumetric quanta of separately
islanded "points" are always
accountable numerically as the second and third powers
of the <I>frequency of modular
subdivision of the system's radial or circumferential
vectors.</I>

 The frequency of any system is determined by the isotropic,
omniintertriangulated, omnidirectionally considerate,
vectorially moduled, subdivision
enumeration of the system's radial and geodesically
chorded circumferential closure's
totally relevant involvement limits taken in respect
to the system's independent, event-
regenerating center. Because of the required omnitriangulation
and isotropicity, systems
are inherently moduled only by equiangular-equilateral
triangles, and their generative
center is that of the vector equilibrium wherefore the
radial and circumferentially chorded
time-size, i.e., frequency-wavelength modules subdivisions,
by which alone system
frequency may be determined, are always identical.

 Because angles are parts of only one cycle, they are
inherently subcyclic.
Because size must be predicated Einsteinianly upon local-experience
time cycles, relative
size is measured in cyclic units. Therefore, angles,
which are less than one cycle, are
inherently less than one unit of size. Angles are inherently
"subsize" consideration.
Because angles are subcyclic, they are "subsize." Therefore,
we are permitted to think
independently of size in respect to triangles, which
consist of three separate angles.

 We may think independently of size in respect to tetrahedra,
which consist of
12 separate angles. Triangles and tetrahedra and all
varieties of polyhedra are thinkable
independently of size. The cyclic-module measurement
of the time of experiencing or
generating the length of the edge of any triangulated
special-case system can represent the
basic "standard" of relative size-comparisoning to other
object experiences. Each cyclic
"sizing" increment is one unit of frequency and each
cyclic increment inherently
constitutes one unit of experienced physical energy.

 Angular fractionation is absolute. Triangles can be
equiangular<SUP>&#95;&#95;</SUP>one-fourth
of a cycle or one-fiftieth of one cycle of unity<SUP>&#95;&#95;</SUP>but
they cannot be equilateral. Angles are
constant and independent of size. Size is always special-case
experience. Angles are
generalized. Only eternal constants can be generalized.
We do not know the length of the
edges. Edges can be any length permitted by time. The
length of the edges is frequency,

 The greater the even number of equal intervals into
which the circumference
of the circle is divided, the more accurately may the
proportioning of the circle's central-
angle-divisioning be described. If the circle is divided
into 360 degrees and if the initial
angle considered is 60 degrees, then its complementary
angle is 300 degrees. If the initial
angle is 90 degrees, its complementary is 270 degrees.
If the initial angle is 180 degrees,
its complementary is also 180 degrees. This ambiguity,
if not thoughtfully considered, can
bring about fatal "wrong-way" errors of direction-taking
in navigational calculations.
What looks like a local fragment of a "straight" line
constitutes a complementary pair of
180-degree angles generated around the center-point
of the line.

 An assumedly straight line both of whose ends are hypothetically
considered
to be leading in opposite directions to infinity also
may have an arbitrarily selected dividing
point located (locally conceptually) upon it from which
the oppositely extending lines
emanate-or upon which point the opposite lines converge
to form a 180-degree angle.
Both of the oppositely-and-outwardly-bound lines of
extension from the 180-degree
angular convergence point are inferentially interminable.
Ergo, as hypothetically assumed
to be "straight" lines, they are paradoxically half-finite
and half-infinite. This is a paradox
consequent to humanity's misassumption of the existence
of the phenomenon of "straight"
lines, an error that occurred in turn only as a consequence
of the inadequate experience of
people at the time they adopted the fallacious assumption.
Such misconceptions are the
logical consequence of humans having always been born
naked, helpless, and ignorant,
though superbly equipped cerebrally, utterly dependent
upon only trial-and-error-based
exploration and survival stratagems.

 The physical Universe is an aggregate of frequencies.
Each chemical element
is uniquely identifiable in the electromagnetic spectrum
by its own unique set of separately
unique frequencies. None of the chemical-element sets
or individual frequencies is the
same as those of any of the other chemical elements'
frequencies. The different
frequencies of one element's set produce unique cyclic-frequency
interactions whose
resonances are similar to musical chords. The electromagnetic
spectrum of physical
Universe embraces the full spectrum range of as yet
discovered and identified radiation
frequencies of all the first 92 self-regenerative, as
well as the only split-second enduring
elements beyond the 92 self-regeneratives thus far discovered
by experimental physics.
The macro/micro-cosmic electromagnetic spectrum chart
discloses a cosmic orchestration
that ranges from those of the microcosmic to the very
complex macrocosmic-embracing
whole celestial Universe nebulae. The human senses are
able to tune in no more than one-
millionth of the total known frequency range limits
of the presently known electromagnetic
spectrum. Whether expressed in foot-pounds per minute
or kilowatt-hours, the total
physical work done by all the muscles of all humans
in all the two and one-half million
years of known presence of humans aboard our planet
Earth, amounts to less than the
energy released in one second of time by one hurricane;
one hurricane's released energy
equals the total energy of the combined atomic bombs
thus far produced and stockpiled by
the Russians and the U.S.A. In contradistinction to
this minuscule energy involvement of
all history's human muscle, the invisible, weightless,
but cosmically magnificent minds of
humans have thus far discovered, quantized, and catalogued
the relative abundance of
each and all of the 92 regenerative chemical elements
occurring on all the visible stars of
known Universe. Thus emerges human awareness of the
physical-energy-mastering
potential of the metaphysical mind's extraordinary information-sorting
and -analyzing
capability.

 By designedly synchronized frequency of reoccurrence
of their constituent
event patternings, a machine gun's bullets may be projected
through a given point in the
rotational patterning of an airplane's propeller blades.
Such purposeful synchronization of
a succession of alternate occupations at a point, first
by a bullet and then by a discretely
angled propeller blade, and repeat, is called angle
and frequency modulation; together,
they avoid interferences. All physical phenomena, from
the largest to the smallest, are
describable as frequencies of discrete angular reoccurrence
of intimately contiguous but
physically discontinuous events. All physical phenomena
are subject to either use or
nonuse of angular- and frequency-modulating interference
capabilities.

 When there is an interference of two energy events
of similar magnitude,
there is a coequal pattern of interference resultants,
as when two knitting needles slide
tangentially by one another. But when one converging
body of an interfering pair is much
larger than the other, the little one "seems" to do
all the resultant moving as viewed by an
observer small enough to see the small converger's motion<SUP>&#95;&#95;</SUP>as,
for instance, human
beings see a tennis ball hit the big ball Earth and
see only the tennis ball bounce away, the
Earth ball being too big to be seen as a ball by the
viewer and the relative bounce-off
deflection of Earth's orbit from the tennis ball point
of impact being too small for
detection. As the magnitudes of energy vectors are products
of the mass multiplied by the
velocity, the velocity may be high and the mass small,
or vice versa, and the vectors
remain the same length or magnitude. A little body moving
at sufficient velocity could
have the same effect upon another body with which it
interferes as could a big body
moving at a slower rate. With these vectorial variables
in mind, we see that there are three
fundamental preconditions of the interference vectors:
where one is larger than the other;
one is the same; or one is smaller in energy magnitude
than the other.

 There are six fundamentally unique patterns of the
resultants of
interferences. The first is a tangential avoidance,
like knitting needles slipping by one
another. The second is modulated noninterference, as
in frequency modulation. The third
is reflection, which results from a relatively direct
impact and a rebound at an acute angle.
The fourth, which is refraction, results from a glancing
impact and an obtuse angle of
deflection. The fifth is a smash-up, which results in
several parts of one or the other
interfering bodies going away from one another in a
plurality of angular directions (as in
an explosion). The sixth is a going-the-same-way, "critical-proximity,"
attraction link-up
such as that established between the coordinated orbiting
of Earth and Moon around the
Sun.

 All three of these vectorial conditions and all six
of these resultants are
manifest in cloud chambers, in which the physicist can
view with his naked eye the
photographed resultants of angular directions and energy-magnitude
lengths of the
interference patternings that occur when, for instance,
they bombard a group of atoms
with an accelerated neutron that moves at such velocity
as probably to interfere with one
or another of billions times billions of atoms present
in the elemental "gas" aggregation.
From these cloud-chamber interference patterns, physicists
are able to calculate much
information regarding the interfering components. The
cloud chamber makes it obvious
that two lines, which are always experimentally proven
to be energy vectors, cannot pass
through the same point at the same time.

 A machine gun is shooting through a swiftly revolving
airplane propeller. It
is automatedly timed to shoot between every blade, or
every second blade, or every third
blade<SUP>&#95;&#95;</SUP>with a sonic "wow" every time it goes between
the propeller blades. We are
synchronizing purposefully. Unautomated by human mind
and brain's anticipatory
designing, bullets would produce a random sequence of
patterns as they hit the propeller
blades; some would at first bounce off precessionally,
while others would knock off
sections of the propeller blades.

 Let us assume two machine guns firing from two different
positions, one of
them due north of a point in space and the other due
west of the same point. One is aimed
south and the other is aimed east, which means they
are both firing through a common
point in space. They are synchronized so that their
bullets will not interfere with one
another. The bullets all weigh the same. If they were
nonsynchronized, they would
frequently meet and be precessionally deflected.

 Now place three machine guns at the three corners
of an equilateral triangle.
From the center of area (sometimes miscalled the center
of gravity) of the equilateral
triangle, one of the three corners lies in a bearing
of 0&deg; (i.e., 360&deg;) in a northerly direction;
the second bears at 120&deg; ; the third at 240&deg; from the
triangle's center. We then aim all three
machine guns toward the center of the triangle and elevate
their aim to 35&deg; 16'. We
synchronize their firing periods to coincide. We thus
introduce an interference at the
center of gravity of a regular tetrahedron whose triangular
base corners are occupied by
the three guns. Precession will take place, with the
result that all three bullets precess into
a vertical trajectory as a triangular formation team
through the apex of the regular
tetrahedron whose base corners are identified by the
three guns.

 Every action has an equal and opposing reaction. So
now let us assume that
instead of machine guns firing in one direction only,
we have three bazookas in which both
action and reaction are employed in two directions.
The double-ended openness of the
bazooka sees the rocket missile projected in one direction
while a blast of air is articulated
in an opposing conical zone of directions. The cone's
<I>inertia</I> provides the shove-off for
the projectile by the explosion. Inertia is dynamic<SUP>&#95;&#95;</SUP>as
sensed in the orbital course integrity
of the enormous mass of Earth going around the Sun at
60,000 m.p.h. so that the little
man on board it, who is also going around the Sun at
60,000 m.p.h., and is also walking
around Earth at four m.p.h. and as he steps around Earth's
surface he pushes Earth in the
opposite direction to his walking, but so negligibly
that the little man does not conceive of
his Earth as movable and so has invented the concept
of completely inert, or "at rest." Our
deceptive fixity of celestial position as a standing
still in Universe is fortified by the
absolute silence of travel in vacuo around the Sun.

 Now we take two bazookas (not three!) firing in different
parallel planes and
not at the same level. One is aimed north-south in respect
to the North Star and the
Southern Cross. The other bazooka is in a parallel plane
but remote; it is aiming east-west.
They are fired, and at each of their two terminals,
we get four precessional effects of the
reactions and resultants occurring at 55 degrees in
respect to their respective parallel
planes. The result will be six vectors interacting to
form the tetrahedron, a <I>tetrahedron of
interferences.</I>

 Though lines (subvisibly spiraling and quantitatively
pulsative) cannot go
through the same point at the same time, they can sometimes
get nearer or farther from
one another. They can get into what we call "critical
proximity." Critical proximity is the
distance between interattracted masses<SUP>&#95;&#95;</SUP>when one body
starts or stops "falling into" the
other and instead goes into orbit around its greater
neighbor, i.e., where it stops yielding
at 180 degrees and starts yielding to the other at 90
degrees. (See Sec. <A HREF="../s10/p0810.html#1009.00">1009</A>.)

 Critical proximity would be, for instance, the relative
interpositioning of the
distances of the Moon-Earth team's Sun co-orbiting wherein
there is a complex mass-
attraction hookup. When at critical proximity the 180-degree
mass attraction takes over
and one starts falling into the other<SUP>&#95;&#95;</SUP>with the attraction
fourfolded every time the distance
between them is halved<SUP>&#95;&#95;</SUP>they establish a mass-attraction,
relative-proximity "contact"
bond and interoperate thereafter as a "universal joint"<SUP>&#95;&#95;</SUP>or
a locally autonomous motion
freedoms' joint. Either body is free to carry on individual,
local, angular-relationship-
changing motions and transformations by itself, such
as revolving and precessing. But
without additional energy from elsewhere being applied
to their interrelationship, they
cannot escape their critical proximity to one another
as they co-orbit together around the
Sun<SUP>&#95;&#95;</SUP>with which they are in common critical proximity.

 Critical proximity occurs at the precessional moment
at which there is a 90-
degree angular transition of interrelationship of the
two bodies from a 180-degree falling-
back-in to a 90-degree orbiting direction, <I>or vice versa.</I>

 The transition of physical phenomena from being an
apparent unit entity to
being an apparent complex, or constellation of a plurality
of entities, is that of the
individual components reaching the critical proximity
precessional condition and "peeling
off " into individual orbits from their previous condition
of falling back into one another
under nonangularly differentiable entity conditions.
This is the difference between an
apparent "stone" and its crushed-apart "dust" parts.

 Critical proximity explains mass-attraction coherence.
It accounts for all the
atoms either falling into one another or precessing
into local orbits. This accounts for the
whole Universe as we observe it, the collections of
things and matter and noncontiguous
space intervals. The coming-apart phase of critical
proximity is radiation. The coming-
together and holding-together phase is emphasized in
our ken as gravity.

 Critical proximity is a threshold, the absolute vector
equilibrium threshold; if
it persists, we call it "matter."
