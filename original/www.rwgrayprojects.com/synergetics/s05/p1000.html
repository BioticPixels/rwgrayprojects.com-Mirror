 A star is an exquisitely concentrated coordination
of events that your optical
tuning facilities are unable to resolve differentially
into separately identifiable events. We
may call a star a point. Playing Euler's game, "stars,"
or "points," are "crossings," or
"fixes" as navigators would say it. As so considered,
a "star-point-crossing" does not have
an outsideness and an insideness. It is the point of
superimposed crossing of trajectories or
of their interferences. A point fix is a potential embryo
consideration, a potential thought,
a potential system.

 Thinking is the consideration of different experiences
and of inherently
separate sets of events, and trying to find out what
their relatedness is. Each one is a star.
How many stars does it take to develop a geometry of
outwardness and inwardness? What
is the minimum number of stars needed to divide the
Universe into outwardness and
inwardness? I find it takes a minimum of four; you can't
do it with three. Four very clearly
has an outsideness and an insideness. This is what we
call the tetrahedron, which has these
four stars and six sets of interrelatedness. This comes
in very interestingly in mathematics
with the generalization that you don't have to worry
too much about the shape, but the
four stars are the minimum we can have for a thought.
If I can at first discover only three
stars in a thought challenge, there must be at least
a fourth star lurking somewhere in the
critical neighborhood. In fact, I discover that the
total number of stars that could possibly
be related is always subdivisible by four. The mathematics
shows this up very clearly as
complexes of tetrahedra. Tetrahedron becomes the minimum
thinkable set, the minimum
reconsiderable set, and it turns out to be the fundamental
increment out of which all
thoughts are constructed.

 A star is the focal point of an as yet undifferentiated
concentration of events,
ergo, considerable or constellar patterning: an exploratory
grouping of stars or complex-
idea entities that seem to man's limited tunability

<I>consideration</I> comes from <I>con,</I> together, and <I>sidus,</I> the
Latin "star." When we have found
all the relationships between the number of items of

 Four is the minimum number of stars having an inherent
arrangement of
withoutness and withinness. The minimum conceptually
considerable, generalized-
experiences-set affording macro-micro separation of
Universe is a set of four local-event
foci. Between the four stars that form the vertexes
of the tetrahedron, there are six edges
that constitute all the possible relationships between
those four stars. The four stars have
an inherent sixness of interrelationship. The four-foci,

 The regenerative patterns of structural events may
be described as constellar
because their component events interinterfere tensively
in high-frequency, dynamic, self-
regenerative patternings which only superficially seem
to stand together as "static"
structures. Star groupings "fly" in celestial formation,
though seeming to hang motionless
in the celestial theater. Any event patternings that
become locally regenerative are
constellar patterns. They are momentarily conceptual.

 Until the present age, people thought that all of
their faculties were
simultaneously and instantly coordinate and operating
at equal velocities. Einstein showed
that neither <I>simultaneous</I> nor <I>instant</I> are valid, i.e.,
experimentally demonstrable. Observe
that when we send up four rockets one-half second apart,
their afterimages are
approximately simultaneous. So we say that we see four
rockets "at the same time." The
illusion of simultaneity is one of the most important
illusions for us to consider. Musicians
may be able to comprehend nonsimultaneity better than
do others. Einstein emphasized the
importance of attempted spontaneous comprehension of
the nonsimultaneity of all the
events of Universe<SUP>&#95;&#95;</SUP>a concept akin to our discovery that
in our Universe, none of the
lines can ever go simultaneously through the same points
(See Sec. <A HREF="p1500.html#517.00">517</A> et seq.). What
Einstein is telling us is that there is no conceptual
validity to the notion that everything in
Universe is actually in simultaneous static array.

 A single event is integrally complex. As angles are
conceptual, independent
of size, events are conceptual, independent of frequency
of occurrence. An "original" or
"prime" energy event is conceptual. An energy event

component, but it is not the nucleus. Nuclei<SUP>&#95;&#95;</SUP>complexedly

and anti-neutrino), and the other set of three-vector
groups corresponds to the neutron
(with its positron and neutrino). Each of these three

 The open-ended tripartite spiral can be considered
as one energy event
consisting of an action, reaction, and resultant. Two
such tripartite-vectored "spirals," one
negative and one positive, combine to form the tetrahedron.

tripartite vector set looks like an "erected cobra"
Z, that is, with two of its interlinked
vector lines on the ground and one erected. One erected
Z cobra erects its third vector
member clockwise, and the other Z cobra erects its third
vector in a counter-clockwise
direction in respect to its base.

 We find that the triangular Z cobra, is not operating
in a plane because there
is no such thing as a plane. Therefore, one of the legs
sticks up a bit. We have a positive Z
cobra and a negative Z cobra, and one cannot nest in
the other. They will never be
congruent with one another, but they can complement
one another to become the
tetrahedron. An event is a triangle. A triangle is an
event. Two of them together make the
tetrahedron.

 Each of the three-vector, action, reaction, and resultant,
minimum event Z
cobras has two open ends and two internal angles. The
two Z cobras have together four
ends and four internal angles. We will call the open
ends <I>male</I> and the internal angles
<I>female.</I> We can marry the two Z cobra, half quantum events
in an always consistent,
orderly manner, by always having a male end interconnected
with an internal female angle.
When all four such marriage ceremonies have been consummated,
we have produced one
tetrahedron, i.e., one quantum, i.e., one prime minimum
structural system of Universe.
When the end of one energy action comes over the middle
of another energy vector, there
is a precessional effect, a tensional effect. One energy
event gets angularly precessed, the
next energy event goes by the center of another mass,
and each one of them interaffects
the other. It is a basketry interweaving, where each
one precesses the other angularly so
that they hold together very much as a cotton ball.

 An energy event is illustrated by a diagram of a man
jumping from one boat
to another. At the top of the picture, a man standing
in one boat jumps. He does not glide
horizontally: he jumps.<SUP>1</SUP> That is, he goes outwardly from
the center of Earth, and that is a
vector. That is an energy action in itself. He jumps.
He is the action. The action was not
just horizontal, it was also vertical. It was mildly
vertical in that he went outwardly. As he
jumps, the boat goes into reaction and shoots off the
other way. A moment later, he lands,
and the second boat moves in a complex that is both
horizontal and vertical. There is a
reaction and a result, so there really is a four-foldedness
going on. It may appear as
threefolded because the man does not jump very high.
We should consider it as a
tetrahedron of very low altitude.

to one another. As the man
jumps from the stern of the boat, it turns and whirls
around, so that the reaction is
following the resultant. They are not going in opposite
directions. The reaction and
resultant run into each other. Notice that it begins

 Engineers have been proud of pointing out that the
difference between
engineers and lay society is that engineers know that
every action has its reaction and that
lay society thinks only of the actions. Before the speed
of light was measured, light
seemed, to all humanity, to be instantaneous. Since
we now know experientially that
neither light nor any other phenomenon is instantaneous,
we may conclude that an action
and the vectors that it creates are neither simultaneously
occurring nor instantaneous.
Because vectors have discrete length, whose dimension
represents the energy mass
multiplied by its velocity, every action vector has
two terminals<SUP>&#95;&#95;</SUP>a "beginning" and an
"ending" at the end of its noninstantaneous action.
The beginnings and the endings are
nonsimultaneously occurrent. Therefore, the "ending"
terminal of an action's vector
occurs later than its "beginning." Therefore, every
action must have a reaction vector at its
"beginning" terminal and a resultant vector at its "ending"
terminal. The reaction vectors
and the resultant vectors are never angled at 180 degrees
to the action vectors. They are
always angled precessionally at other than 180 degrees.

 Mechanically and chemically, a steerable rocket embraces
a complex of
internal and external events. Both airplanes and steerable
rockets are complexes of internal
and external energy-event transactions and omni-interacting,
resultant "motions" in
Universe transcendental to Earth motions, where the
observer-articulator is
extraterrestrially positioned. Since the Earth is moving
as a dependent motion-complex in
respect to the Sun's and other planets' motions, and
since the Sun is engaged in a plurality
of internal and external motions in respect to the galactic
system, and since the galactic
system is a complex of motions in respect to other galaxies
and supergalaxies, and so on,
and since the whole set of motion events are nonsimultaneous
and of uniquely variant
durations, and since the intereffects of the events
vary vastly in respect to eons of time, it
is obvious that any thinkably meaningful conceptual
coordination of event
interrelationships in the meager lifetime limits of
humans is inherently limited to a
relatively local set within Universe and within a time
sense, and the relationships may be
measured only in respect to the angle and frequency
magnitude characteristics of any one
subsystem of the totality.

 The vectorial angulation of both the experientially
observed and the
experimentally articulated is always referential to
the axis of conceptual observation of the
observer or the articulator, respectively. These always
and only coexisting functions of
experience and experiments embrace the fundamental parameters
of operational science.

 "My life" is the progressive harvestings of the information
unpredictably
accruing in the attempt to be both adequate and accurate.
The harvest is stored in the
brain bank. Life consists of alternate observing and
articulating interspersed with variable-
recall rates of "retrieved observations" and variable
rates of their reconsideration to the
degrees of "understandability."

 The axis of reference is the axis of conceptual observation.
The axis of
observer reference frequently occurs spontaneously:
as the line between the nose and the
navel.

 The direction of a vector is an angular one in respect
to an omnidirectional
coordinate system having a specific central point and
a specific set of external points at
specific angles and distances from one another and from
the central point.

 Our definition of an opening is that it is framed
by trajectories. Every
trajectory in a system has at least two crossings, but
these crossings are as viewed,
because the lines could be at different levels from
other points of observation.
