 Life is the eternal present in the temporal. Life
is the <I>now</I> event with reaction
<I>past</I> and resultant <I>future.</I> Each individual life is a
special-case articulation of the infinite
variety of "scenarios" to be realized within the multidegrees
of freedom and vast range of
frequencies of actions that are accommodated by the
generalized laws governing Universe.
With death, the individual probably loses nothing but
gains the insight and knowledge of
all others as well.

 The average of all plus (+) and minus (-) weights
of Universe is zero
weight. The normal is weightless, eternal. What we call
life is a complex of
multidimensional oscillations and palpitations among
various degrees of positive and
negative asymmetries, whose multivariant lags in conceptioning
bring about what <I>seems</I> to
be temporal substance and time. The complex <I>woof</I> of
a plurality of lag rates<SUP>&#95;&#95;</SUP>of
afterimages and recalls<SUP>&#95;&#95;</SUP>produces pure, weightless, metaphysical
images, produces the
awareness we speak of as life.

 Lags are intervals<SUP>&#95;&#95;</SUP>nothing. Instantaneity would eliminate
otherness, time,
and self-and-other-awareness. Instantaneity and eternity
are both timeless: they are the
same. Eternity contains time; time does not contain
eternity. The relationship is
irreversible. The contained time of eternity provides
eternal awareness.

 Organisms: Atoms are inanimate systems. Physically
we consist entirely of
atoms. When we die, all the atoms are there. Whatever
life was, it was not the inanimate
atom systems that persist after death. At the virus
level of professional concern the
scientists say you can identify all the physical substances
present as inanimate crystals.
Biological science initiated the investigations that
successively discovered cells, genes,
chromosomes, and other biological design controls. Needing
to check their design control
theories, they employed the swift succession of generations
of the fruit fly and then
discovered the even swifter succession of the generations
of the tobacco mosaic virus.
This brought the scientists into a very new realm of
virology where they found nuclear
physicists, biologists, and chemists all involved. Though
the virologists have discovered
DNA-RNA bioprogramming controls, they have found only
inanimate atomic constituents.
Because their whole series of events started with biology,
they have as yet<SUP>&#95;&#95;</SUP>unthinkingly
and mistakenly<SUP>&#95;&#95;</SUP>retained the "animate" relationship.
Biology began with the whole
seemingly living organisms consisting of protoplasm
and viruses, but they misidentified the
viral substances as physically "animate," when life
is not physical. The error lies in the fact
that humanity long ago misassumed that the organism
employed by life is the life itself
instead of merely the vehicle<SUP>&#95;&#95;</SUP>as if the telephone was
the communication itself instead of
merely the instrument.

 The now overspecialized scientists seem to have forsaken
epistemological
significances; they seem to have lost their gift for
philosophical thinking. So the focus on
the animate aspect of physical things has been continued
by the church. Many religious
organizations establish their power by maintaining that
life is the physical apparatus it
employs and by basing their ideals on "living" physical
images. If life were the physical, we
really could make synthetic men, laboratory animals,
and artificial intelligence; we never
will. We can make brainy robots, but we cannot make
thinking, loving life.

 It has been customarily said by the public journals,
assumedly bespeaking
public opinion, that "the scientists wrest order out
of chaos." But the scientists who have
made the great discoveries have been trying their best
to tell the public that, as scientists,
they have never found chaos to be anything other than
the superficial confusion of innately
a priori human ignorance at birth<SUP>&#95;&#95;</SUP>an ignorance that
is often burdened by the biases of
others to remain gropingly unenlightened throughout
its life. What the scientists have
always found by physical experiment was an a priori
orderliness of nature, or Universe
always operating at an elegance level that made the
discovering scientists' own working
hypotheses seem crude by comparison. The discovered
reality made the scientists'
exploratory work seem relatively disorderly.

 We may say that nature proceeds from the obviously
orderly and
symmetrical to the nonobviously (but always) orderly
transformation phases known as
asymmetries, which, having gone through their maximum
or peak positive-phase
asymmetry, only <I>seem</I> (to the uninformed brain) to be
disorderly; they always return
transformatively thereafter through an orderly progression
of decreasing asymmetry to a
fleeting passing through the condition of <I>obvious</I> symmetry
or equilibrium popularly
recognized as "order," thereafter deviating asymmetrically
to the negative phase of
balancing limits of oscillation.

 Oscillation of Symmetry and Asymmetry: Symmetry is
only generalized. In
cosmic-event averaging symmetry is ever implicit in
the preponderantly-almost-
symmetrical, spontaneous symmetry-referenceability of
all asymmetry. Symmetry is
systemic. Symmetry has nothing to do with the scenario
series; it has nothing to do with
local, special case realizations. You can find balances
in series<SUP>&#95;&#95;</SUP>positive and negative
energies<SUP>&#95;&#95;</SUP>but absolute symmetry is characteristic only
of generalized systems. (See Secs.

 Crystallography is always special-case and is always
confronted with near-
symmetric asymmetry; ergo, crystallography must recognize
and reference its special case
aspects to generalized symmetry. Generalized symmetric
conceptuality is only manifest as
the vector equilibrium and its involvement domain. The
regular<SUP>&#95;&#95;</SUP>regular means absolutely
uniangular<SUP>&#95;&#95;</SUP>tetrahedron is absolute and generalized,
thus never physically realized. All
physical reality is special case. This is why Universe

 Within every equilateral triangle, we can inscribe
a three-bladed propeller, its
tips protruded into the three corners. The propeller
blades are approximately pear-shaped,
and each of the blades is the same shape as the others.
The pear-shaped propeller blade is
locally asymmetrical. We call this revolvable omnibalanced
asymmetry <I>dynamic symmetry.</I>

 We then have three pear-shaped blades at 120 symmetrical
degrees from one
another. They act as three perpendicular bisectors of
an equilateral triangle, crossing each
other at the triangle's center of area and dividing
the total triangle into six right triangles,
of which three are positive and three are negative.
So there are six fundamentals of the
triangle that make possible dynamic symmetry. (One part
may look like a scalene, but it
doesn't matter because it is always in balance.) Each
corner is balanced by its positive and
negative<SUP>&#95;&#95;</SUP>like four streetcorners. This is called dynamic
balance. Literally, all machinery is
dynamically balanced in this manner.

 Let me take one propeller blade by itself. I am going
to split it longitudinally
and get an S curve, one in which the rates are changing
and no power of the curve is the
same. So it is asymmetrical by itself: it is repeated
six times: positive, negative, positive,
negative . . . and the six blades come round in dynamic
symmetry. The energy forces
involved are in beautiful absolute balance. We have
energetic balance.

 The effects of all components of Universe in motion
upon any other
component in motion is precession, and inasmuch as all
the component patterns of
Universe seem to be motion patterns, in whatever degree
they affect one another, they are
interaffecting one another precessionally, and they
are bringing about angular resultants
other than the 180 degreenesses. Precess means that
two or more bodies move in an
interrelationship pattern of other than 180 degrees.

 Precession is the effect of any moving system upon
any other moving
system; the closer the proximity, the more powerful
the effect. Mass attraction is inherent
in precession. Mass attraction is to precession as a
single note is to music. We do not pay
much attention to precession because we think only of
our own integral motions instead of
those of Universe, though we are precessing Universe
every time we take a step.

 Precession is regenerative, and that is why you have
the wave. When the
stone drops in the water, it impinges on the molecules
and their atoms; everything is set in
motion, and immediately there is a resultant at 90 degrees.
The resultant is the wave; the
90 degreeness begets another 90 degreeness, this 90
degreeness begets another 90
degreeness, and so on until you have a series of 90
degreeness interrelationships, i.e., an
omnilocally-orbiting system, as with all the electrons
of all the atoms, and all the stars of
the galaxies.

 Precession is the intereffect of individually operating
cosmic systems upon
one another. Since Universe is an aggregate of individually
operative systems, all of the
intersystem effects of Universe are precessional, and
the 180-degree imposed forces
usually result in redirectional resultants of 90 degrees.
Gravity's 180-degree
circumferential, omniembracement effect results in a
90-degree inwardly effected pressure
that gains rapidly in intensity as the initially sixfold
leverage advantage of the
circumferentially tensed embracement gains exponentially
in locally induced pressure as
the radial distance outwardly from the sphere's center
is decreased.

 Despite the angularly modified resultant complexities
of omnidirectionally
operative precessional forces upon ever-varyingly interpositioned
cosmic bodies, Universe
may be manifesting to us that there is always and only
operative an omniintegrated cosmic
coordination of cosmic independents' actions and reactions,
wherein with radial
broadcasting of energy there is an exponentially increasing
diffusion as well as
disturbance-diminishing resultant energy effectiveness,
producing widely varying angular
aberrations of the precession, wherein nonetheless there
is always an initial individual-to-
individual operative attractiveness whereby

 There is the phenomenon known as the Doppler effect,
of which humans
took much note in the early days of the steam locomotive.
The high tone of the
locomotive's whistle as it approached changed to an
increasingly low pitch as the
locomotive went by. This is because the sound waves
of perturbed air coming toward us
at about 700 miles per hour from the approaching locomotive
were crowded together,
piled up, by the locomotive's own independent speed
of about 60 miles per hour.
Similarly, the waves were thinned out by the locomotive's
speeding away.

 The Doppler effect also may be operating in our historical-event-cognition
system in such a manner that the relative frequency
and wavelengths of approaching
historical events are compacted and receding ones are
thinned out. It could be that by
traveling mentally backward in history as far as we
have any information, humans

 The Doppler effect, or wave-reception frequency modulation
caused by the
relative motions of the observer and the observed, are
concentric wave systems that
compound as fourth- and fifth-power accelerations. In
the summary of synergetic
corollaries
(Sec. <A HREF="../s02/p4000.html#240.44">240.44</A>),
fifth- and sixth-powering
are identified as products of
multiplication by frequency doublings and treblings,
etc., in radiational or gravitational
wave systems.

 The Doppler effect is usually conceived of as an approximately
"linear"
experience. "You," the observer, stand beside a railway
track (which is a "linear" model);
a swift train approaches with whistle valve held open
(at a constant-frequency pitch as
heard "on board" by the engineer "blowing" the whistle).
The whistle sound comes to you
at the atmospheric sound-wave speed of approximately
700 linear miles per hour, but the
train is speeding toward you at an additional 60 linear
miles per hour. The train's motion
reduces the interval between the successive wave emissions,
which in effect decreases the
wavelength, which gives it "higher" pitch as heard at
your remote and "approached"
hearing position. After the train goes by, the train
runs away from each successive wave
emission, thus increasing the interval between wave
"crests" and therefore lengthening the
wave-reception intervals, which apparently "lowers"
the pitch as <I>you</I> hear it, but not as
others elsewhere may hear it. This is pure observational
hearing relativity. But the real
picture of the Doppler effect is not linear; it is omnidirectional.

 The Doppler effect may also be explained in omnidirectional,
experience-
patterning conceptionality, which is more informative
than the familiar linear
conceptioning of the railroad train and "you" at the
crossing. Suppose "you" were flying in
an air transport that exploded; because of the sudden
change in pressure differential
between your innards and your out'ards at high altitude,
you personally have just been
"exploded" into many separate parts, which are receding
from one another at high
velocity. A series of secondary explosions follows elsewhere
from exploding "you" and at
various locales in the center of the galaxy of exploding
debris, as one item after another of
the late airplane's explosive cargo is reached by progressive
local-conflagration-heat
concentrations. The sound waves of the successive explosions
speed after your receding
parts, amongst which are your two ear diaphragms, as
yet "stringily" interconnected with
your exploding brain cells, which "hear" the explosion's
sound waves first at low pitch.
But as your parts explode from one another at a decelerating
rate because of air friction,
etc., the waves of remote-explosion sounds "shorten"
and pitches go "up." Now consider
many separate, nonsimultaneous, secondary explosions
of your various exploding parts, all
of varying intensities of energetic content and in varying
degrees of remoteness, and
realize that the decelerations and accelerations of
Doppler effects will render some of the
explosive reverberations infra and some ultra to your
tuning-range limits of hearing, so
that the sum total of <I>heard</I> events provides very different
total conceptioning as heard
from various points in the whole galaxy of exploding
events, whose separate components
would tend to new grouping concentrations.

 Because the humanly "heard" events are geared directly
to the atmospheric
waves with an average speed of 700 miles per hour, and
the humanly "seen" events
operate a million times faster and are geared to electromagnetic
fields operating
independent of and beyond the atmospheric biosphere
of Earth, the visual and hearable
information is macrocosmically so far out of synchronization
that the stroboscopic effect,
which can make the wheels of automobiles sometimes appear
to be going backward in
amateur moving pictures, can cause society to misinterpret
the direction and speed of vital
events<SUP>&#95;&#95;</SUP>some may be seen as going in the opposite direction
from the realities of universal
evolution.
