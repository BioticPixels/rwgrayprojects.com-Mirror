 The phenomenon "infinity" of the calculus is inherently
finite (see Sec.
<A HREF="../s02/p2400.html#224.11">224.11</A>).
Universe is nonsimultaneous but finite, because
all experiences <I>begin</I> and <I>end,</I>
and being terminal, are finite; ergo, Universe as the
sum of finites is finite.

 Nonsimultaneous Universe is finite but conceptually
undefinable; local
systems are definable. We discover that Universe is
finite and a local system is <I>definite;</I>
every definite local system has inherent, always and
only co-occurring twoness of polar
axis spinnability and twoness of concave-convex complementary
disparity of energy
interaction behavior,<SUP>4</SUP> plus two invisible tetrahedra
(or two unities), altogether adding
together as equal finitely fourfold symmetry Universe.
The difference between Universe
and any local system is always two invisible tetrahedra.
Every local system may be
subdivided into whole tetrahedra.

Universe equals eight cyclic unities. Every tetrahedron

 Halo conceptioning discloses the minute yet finitely
discrete inaccuracy of
the fundamental assumption upon which calculus was built;
to wit, that for an infinitesimal
moment a line is congruent with the circle to which
it is tangent and that a plane is
congruent with the sphere to which it is tangent. Calculus
had assumed 360 degrees
around <I>every</I> point on a sphere. The sum of a sphere's
angles was said to be infinite. The
halo concept and its angularly generated topology proves
that there are always 720
degrees, or two times unity of 360 degrees, <I>less</I> than
the calculus' assumption of 360
degrees times every point in every "spherical" system.
This 720 degrees equals the sum of
the angles of a tetrahedron. We can state that the number
of vertexes of any system
(including a "sphere," which must, geodesically, in
universal-energy conservation, be a
polyhedron of n vertexes) minus two times 360 degrees
equals the sum of the angles
around all the vertexes of the system. Two times 360
degrees, which was the amount
subtracted, equals 720 degrees, which is the angular
description of the tetrahedron. We
have to take angular "tucks" in the nonconceptual finity
(the calculus infinity). The "tucks"
add up to 720 degrees, i.e., one tetrahedron. The difference
between conceptual de-finity
and nonconceptual finity is one nonconceptual, finite
tetrahedron.

 In the general theory of variables, it has been recognized
that the set of all
the variables may be divided into two classes: (1) the
class of all the inclusive variables
within a given system, the <I>interior relevants,</I> and (2)
the class of all those operative
exclusive of the system, the <I>exterior relevants.</I> It
has been further recognized that the
variables outside the system may affect the system from
outside. In varying degrees,
specific levels of subclasses of these "background"
or outside variables are identified as
<I>parameters.</I> But the "background" concept is fallaciously
inadequate; dealing with
insideness and outsideness for "background" is limited
to the two-dimensional or flat-
projection concept, which inherently lacks insideness<SUP>&#95;&#95;</SUP>ergo,
cannot also have outsideness,
which always and only coexists with insideness. Ergo,
all two-dimensional copings with
systems are inherently inadequate and prophetically
vitiated.

 Because spherical sensations are produced by polyhedral
arrays of
interferences identified as points approximately equidistant
from a point at the
approximate center, and because the mass-attractive
or -repulsive relationships of all
points with all others are most economically shown by
chords and not arcs, the spherical
array of points is all interconnected triangularly by
the family of generalized principles
being operative as Universe, which produces very-high-frequency,
omnitriangulated
geodesic structures, which are an aggregate of chords
triangularly interconnecting all the
nearestly-surrounding points whose vertexly-converging
angles always add up to less than

 A building can be thought of as a clock, i.e., as
a feedback circuitry wherein
local pushings and pullings are structurally regenerative
and ever-self-restabilizing. The
spirally overlapping critical path of progressive accomplishments
that led to humans
reaching the Moon and returning safely to Earth involved
not a linear months-and-years
progression but an around-the-Sun-by-Earth orbiting
and an around-the-Earth-by-Moon
orbiting progression of accomplished events wherein
humans progressively established one
feedback circuitry system overlapping another, and another,
more than a million times, as
the year of Earth-Moon orbiting of 365 axially-rotated-in-orbit
days drew to orbital close
at a galactic merry-go-round repositioning in the cosmic
theater that finds the planet Earth
and its 92-million-miles-away Sun six billion miles
away from where their Earth-Sun year
began. And all of these celestially complex "goings-on"
had to be competently
comprehended and attended in order for humans to ferry
both outward and returning
between the complexedly moving Earth and the ever-more-complexedly
orbiting, spinning,
and galaxying Sun-Earth-Moon team.

of omniinterrelated,

humans as the whole show co-orbited
the Sun. The entire complex operation resulted in an

 In a polyhedral system, critical-proximity-interference
domains are defined
by interconnecting the adjacent centers of area of all
the separate superficial faces, i.e.,
"external areas" or "openings," surrounding the vertex,
or "crossing." The surface domain
of a surface vertex is a complex of its surrounding
triangles: a hexagon, pentagon, or other
triangulated polygon.

 There are domains of the tetrahedron interfaced (triple-bonded)
with
domains of the octahedron. The domains of both are rationally
subdivided into either A or
B Modules. There is the center of volume (or gravity)
of the tetrahedron and the center of
volume (or gravity) of the octahedron, and the volumetric
relationship around those
centers of gravity is subdivisible rationally by A and
B Quanta Modules<SUP>5</SUP> in neat integer
whole numbers. I can then speak of these domains quantitatively
without consideration of
now obsolete (superficial) face surfaces, i.e., polyhedra.
Even though the cork is not in the
bottle, I can speak quantitatively about the contents
of the bottle. This is because it is a
domain even though the edge-surrounded opening is uncorked.
So we have no trouble
topologically considering tensegrity mensuration. It
is all open work, but its topological
domains are clearly defined in terms of the centers
of the systems involved having unique,

area itself: it is the superficial one that man has

 There are critical proximities tensionally and critical
proximities
compressionally<SUP>&#95;&#95;</SUP>that is, there are attractive fields
and repelling fields, as we learn from
gravity and electromagnetics. There are domains or fields
of actions. In gases under
pressure, the individual molecules have unique atomic
component behaviors that, when
compressed, do not allow enough room for the accelerated
speeds of their behavior; the
crowded and accelerating force impinges upon the containing
membrane to stretch that
membrane into maximum volume commensurate with the restraints
of its patterned
dimensions.
