 The notion that tetrahedra lack polarity is erroneous.
There is a polarization
of tetrahedra, but it derives only from considering
a <I>pair</I> of tetrahedral edge vectors that
do not intersect one another. The opposing vector mid-edges
have a polar
interrelationship.

 Let us take a foam rubber tetrahedron and compress
on one of its four faces
inward toward its opposite vertex instead of slicing
it away. It remains symmetrical, but
smaller. If we pull out on a second face at the same
rate that we push in on the first face,
the tetrahedron will remain the same size. It is still
symmetrical, but the pushing of the first
face made it get a little smaller, while the pulling
of the second face made it get a little
larger. By pushing and pulling at the same rate, it
remains the same size, but its center of
gravity has to move because the whole tetrahedron seems
to move. As it moves, it
receives one positive alteration and one negative alteration.
But in moving it we have
acted on only two of the tetrahedron's four faces. We
could push in on the third face at a
rate different from the first couple, which is already
operating; and we could pull out the
fourth face at the same rate we are pushing in on the
third face. We are introducing two
completely different rates of change: one being very
fast and the other slow; one being
very hard and the other soft. We are introducing two
completely different rates of change
in physical energy or change in abstract metaphysical
conceptuality. These completely
different rates are coupled so that the tetrahedron
as a medium of exchange remains both
symmetrical and the same size, but it has to change
its position to accommodate two
alterations of the center of gravity positioning but
not in the same plane or the same line.
So it will be moving in a semihelix. This is another
manifestation of precessional
resultants.

 The tetrahedron's four faces may be identified as
A, B, C, and D. Any two of
these four faces can be coupled and can be paired with
the other two to provide the
dissimilar energy rate-of-exchange accommodation.
 (N<SUP>2</SUP> - N)/2 =
the number of

 (16 - 4) / 2 = 6. There
are six possible

may be interpaired in (N<SUP>2</SUP> - N)/2

Thus any one tetrahedron can accommodate 15 different
<I>amplitude</I> (A) and, or <I>frequency</I>
(F) of interexchanging without altering the tetrahedron's
size while, however, always
changing the tetrahedron's apparent occurrence locale;
therefore the number of possible
alternative exchanges are three; i.e., AA, AF, FF; therefore,
3 &#215; 15 = 45 different
combinations of <I>interface couplings</I> and message contents
can be accommodated by the
same apparent unit-size tetrahedron, the only resultants
of which are the 15 relocations of
the tetrahedrons and the 45 different message accommodations.

 Tetrahedron has the extraordinary capability of remaining
symmetrically
coordinate and entertaining 15 pairs of completely disparate
rates of change of three
different classes of energy behaviors in respect to
the rest of Universe and not changing its
size. As such, it becomes a universal joint to couple
disparate actions in Universe. So we
should not be surprised at all to find nature using
such a facility and moving around
Universe to accommodate all kinds of local transactions,
such as coordination in the
organic chemistry or in the metals. The symmetry, the
fifteenness, the sixness, the
foumess, and the threeness are all constants. This induced
"motion," or position
displacement, may explain all apparent motion of Universe.
The fifteenness is unique to
the icosahedron and probably valves the 15 great circles
of the icosahedron.

 A tetrahedron has the strange property of <I>coordinate
symmetry,</I> which
permits local alteration without affecting the symmetrical
coordination of the whole. This
means it is possible to receive changes in respect to
one part or direction of Universe and
not in the direction of the others and still have the
symmetry of the whole. In
contradistinction to any other Platonic or Archimedean
symmetrical "solid," only the
tetrahedron can accommodate local asymmetrical addition
or subtraction without losing its
cosmic symmetry. Thus the tetrahedron becomes the only
exchange agent of Universe that
is not itself altered by the exchange accommodation.

 <B>Size Comes to Zero:</B> There are three different aspects
of size<SUP>&#95;&#95;</SUP>linear, areal,
and volumetric<SUP>&#95;&#95;</SUP>and each aspect has a different velocity.
As you move one of the
tetrahedron's faces toward its opposite vertex, it gets
smaller and smaller, with the three
different velocities operative. But it always remains
a tetrahedron with six edges, four
vertexes, and four faces. So the symmetry is not lost
and the fundamental topological
aspect<SUP>&#95;&#95;</SUP>its 60-degreeness<SUP>&#95;&#95;</SUP>never changes. As the faces
move in, they finally become
congruent to the opposite vertex as all three velocities
come to zero at the same time. The
degreeness, the six edges, the four faces, and the
symmetry were never altered because
they were not variables. The only variable was size.
Size alone can come to zero. The
conceptuality of the other aspects never changes.

 You can make a model of a tetrahedron by taking a
heavy-steel-rod triangle
and running three rubber bands from the three vertexes
into the center of gravity of the
triangle, where they can be tied together. Hold the
three rubber bands where they come
together at the center of gravity. The inertia of the
steel triangle will make the rubber
bands stretch, and the triangle becomes a tetrahedron.
Then as the rubber bands contract,
the triangle will lift again. With such a triangle dangling
in the air by the three stretched
rubber bands, you can suddenly and swiftly plunge your
hand forth and back through the
relatively inert triangle . . . making first a positive
and then a negative triangle. (In the
example given in Sec.
 <A HREF="p2200.html#623.20">623.20</A>, the opposite face was
pumped through the inert vertex. It
can be done either way.) This kind of oscillating pump
is typical of some of the atom
behaviors. An atomic clock is just such an oscillation
between a positive and a negative
tetrahedron.

compound curvature system, ergo, the minimum sphere.
We discover that the additive

are two tetrahedra and that the insideness and outsideness
complementary tetrahedra
altogether represent the two invisible complementary

that the sum of the

 The two invisible and <I>n</I>-sized tetrahedra that complement
all systems to
aggregate sum totally as finite but nonsimultaneously

between the sensorial, special-
case, conceptually measurable, finite, separately experienced
system and the balance of
nonconceptual scenario Universe is two finitely conceptual

We can say that scenario Universe is finite because
(though nonsimultaneously conceptual
and considerable) it is the sum of the conceptually
finite, after-image-furnished thoughts of
our experience systems plus two finite but invisible,

 The world military forces use reinforced concrete
tetrahedra for military tank
impediments. This is because tetrahedra lock into available
space by friction and not by
fitting. They are used as the least disturbable barrier

 The tetrahedron's inherent refusal to fit allows it
to get ever a little closer; in
not fitting additional space, it is always available
to accommodate further forced
intrusions. The tetrahedron's edges and vertexes scratch
and dig in and thus produce the
powerfully locking-in-place frictions . . . while stacks
of neatly fitting cubes just come

 This is why stone is crushed to make it less spherical
and more tetrahedral.
This is why beach sand is not used for cement; it is
too round. Spheres disassociate;
tetrahedra associate spontaneously. The limit conditions
involved are the inherent
geometrical limit conditions of the sphere enclosing
the most volume with the least surface
and the fewest angular protrusions, while the tetrahedron
encloses the least volume with
the most surface and does so with most extreme angular
vertex protrusion of any regular
geometric forms. The sphere has the least interfriction
surface with other spheres and the
greatest mass to restrain interfrictionally; while the
tetrahedra have the most interfriction,
interference surface with the least mass to restrain.

have no dimension and are unoccupiable as is also the

points to define a plane. The fourth point, which is

 There is a symmetry of the tetrahedron, but it is
inherently four-dimensional
and related to the four planes and the four axes projected
perpendicularly to those planes
from their respective subtending vertexes. But the tetrahedron
lacks three-dimensional
symmetry due to the fact that the subtending vertex
is only on one side of the triangular
plane, and due to the fact that the center of gravity
of the tetrahedron is always only one-
quarter of its altitude irrespective of the seeming
asymmetry of the tetrahedron.

 The dynamic symmetry of the tetrahedron involves the
inward projection of
four geodesic connectors with the center of area of
the triangular face opposite each
vertex of the tetrahedron (regular or maxi-asymmetrical);
which four vertex-to-opposite-
triangle geodesic connectors will all pass through the
center of gravity of the

extension of those geodesics
thereafter through the four centers of gravity of those
four triangular planes, outwardly
from the tetrahedron to four new vertexes equidistant
outwardly from the three corners of
their respective four basal triangular facet planes
of the original tetrahedron. The four
exterior vertexes are equidistant outwardly from the
original tetrahedron, a distance equal
to the interior distances between the centers of gravity
of the original tetrahedron's four
faces and their inwardly subtending vertexes. This produces
four regular tetrahedra
outwardly from the four faces of the basic tetrahedron
and triple-bonded to the original
tetrahedron.

 We have turned the tetrahedron inside out in four
different directions and
each one of the four are dimensionally similar. This
means that each of the four planes of
the tetrahedron produces four new points external to
the original tetrahedron, and four
similar tetrahedra are produced outwardly from the four
faces of the original tetrahedron;
these four external points, if interconnected, produce
one large tetrahedron, whose six
edges lie outside the four externalized tetrahedra's
12 external edges.

 As we have already discovered in the vector equilibrium
(see Sec.
 <A HREF="../s04/p7000.html#480.00">480</A>), each
tetrahedron has its negative tetrahedron produced through
its interior apex rather than
through its outer triangular base. In the vector equilibrium,
each tetrahedron has its
negative tetrahedron corresponding in dynamic symmetry
to its four-triangled, four-
vertexed, fourfold symmetry requirement. And all eight
(four positive and four negative)
tetrahedra are clearly present in the vector equilibrium.
Their vertexes are congruent at the
center of the vector equilibrium. Each of the tetrahedra
has one internal edge
circumferentially congruent with the other tetrahedra's
edge, and each of the tetrahedra's
three internal edges is thus double-bonded circumferentially
with three other tetrahedra,
making a fourfold cluster in each hemisphere. This exactly
balances a similarly bonded
fourfold cluster in its opposite hemisphere, which is
double-bonded to their hemisphere's
fourfold cluster by six circumferentially double-bonded,
internal edges. Because there are
four equatorial planes of symmetry of the vector equilibrium,
there are four different sets
of the fourfold tetrahedra clusters that can be differentiated
one from the others.

 When the dynamic symmetry is inside-outingly developed
through the
tetrahedron's base to produce the negatively balancing
tetrahedron, only the four negative
tetrahedra are externally visible, for they hide entirely
the four positive triangular faces of
the positive tetrahedron's four-base, four-vertex, fourfold
symmetry. The positive
tetrahedron is internally congruent with the four internally
hidden, triangular faces of the
four surrounding negative tetrahedra. This is fundamental
irreversibility: the outwardly
articulated dynamic symmetry is not regeneratively procreative
in similar tetrahedral
growth. The successive edges of the overall tetrahedron
will never be rationally congruent
with the edges of the original tetrahedron. This growth
of dissimilar edges may bring
about all the different frequencies of the different
chemical elements.

 The star tetrahedron consists of five equal tetrahedra,
four external and one
internal. Because its external edges are not 180-degree
angles, it has 18<SUP>&#95;&#95;</SUP>instead of
six<SUP>&#95;&#95;</SUP>equi-vector external edges: 12 outwardly extended
and six inwardly valleyed; ergo, a
total of 18. It is a compound structure. Four of its
five tetrahedra, which are nonoutwardly
regenerative in unit-length vectors, ergo, non-allspace-filling,
are in direct correspondence
with the five four-ball tetrahedra which do close-pack
to form a large, regular, three-
frequency tetrahedron of four-ball edges, having one
tetrahedral four-ball group at the
center rather than an octahedral group as is the case
with planar and linear topological
phenomena. This is not really contradictory because
the space inside the four-ball
tetrahedron is always a small concave octahedron, wherefore,
an octahedron is really at
the center, though not an octahedron of six balls as
at the center of a four, four-ball
tetrahedral "pyramid."

 The star tetrahedron is a structure<SUP>&#95;&#95;</SUP>but it is a compound
structure. The fifth
tetrahedron, which is the original one, and only nuclear
one accommodates the pulsations
of the outer four. Its outward pulsings are broadcast,
and its inward pulsings are
repulsive<SUP>&#95;&#95;</SUP>that is why it is a star. The four three-way<SUP>&#95;&#95;</SUP>12
in total<SUP>&#95;&#95;</SUP>external pulsations
are unrestrained, and the internal pulsations are compressionally
repulsed. Leonardo called
it the star tetrahedron, not because it has points,
but because he sensed intuitively that it
gives off radiation like a star. The star tetrahedron
is an impulsive-expulsive transceiver
whose four, 12-faceted, exterior triangles can either
(a) feed in cosmic energy receipts
which spontaneously articulate one or another of the
15 interpairings of the six A, B, C, D,
interior tetrahedron's couplings, or (b) transmit through
one of the external tetrahedra
whose respective three faces each must be refractively
pulsated once more to beam or
broadcast the 45 possible AA, AF, FF messages.

 There is a syntropic pulsation receptivity and an
outward pulsation in
dynamic symmetry of the star tetrahedron. As an energy
radiator, it is entropic. It does not
regenerate itself internally, i.e., gravitationally,
as does the isotropic vector matrix's vector
equilibrium. The star tetrahedron's entropy may be the
basis of irreversible radiation,
whereas the syntropic vector equilibrium's reversibility<SUP>&#95;&#95;</SUP>inwardly-outwardly<SUP>&#95;&#95;</SUP>is
the basis
for the gravitationally maintained integrity of Universe.
The vector equilibrium produces
conservation of omnidynamic Universe despite many entropic
local energy dissipations of
star tetrahedra. The star tetrahedron is in balance
with the vector equilibrium<SUP>&#95;&#95;</SUP>pumpable,
irreversible, like the electron in behavior. It has
the capability of self-positionability by
converting its energy receipts to unique refraction
sequences, which could change output
actions to other dynamic, distances-keeping orbits,
in respect to the<SUP>&#95;&#95;</SUP>also only remotely
existent and operating<SUP>&#95;&#95;</SUP>icosahedron, and its 15 unique,
great-circle self-dichotomizing;
which icosahedra can only associate with other icosahedra
in either linear-beam export or
octahedral orbital hover-arounds in respect to any vector
equilibrium nuclear group. (See

 The univalent antitetrahedra twist but do not pump.
The singlebonded
tetrahedra are also inside-outable, but by torque, by
twist, and not by triangular diaphragm
pumping. The lines of the univalent antitetrahedron
are non-self-interfering. Like the lamp
standards at Kennedy International Airport, New York,
the three lines twist into plus (+)
and minus (-) tetrahedra. MN and OP are in the same
plane, with A and A ` on the
opposite sides of the plane. So you have a <I>vertexial</I>

 The star tetrahedron is nonreversible. It can only
propagate outwardly. (The
vector equilibrium can keep on reproducing itself inwardly
or outwardly, gravitationally.)
The star tetrahedron's four external tetrahedra cannot
regenerate themselves; but they are
external-energy-receptive, whether that energy be tensive
or pressive. The star tetrahedron
consists only of A Modules; it has no B Modules. The
star tetrahedron may explain a
whole new phase of energetic Universe such as, for instance,
Negative Universe.

 The vector equilibrium's closest-packed sphere shell
builds outwardly to
produce successively the neutron and proton counts of
the 92 regenerative chemical
elements. The star tetrahedron may build negatives for
the post-uraniums. The star
tetrahedron's six potential geodesic interconnectors
of the star tetrahedron's outermost
points are out of vector-length frequency-phase and
generate different frequencies each
time they regenerate; they expand in size due to the
self-bulging effects of the 15 energy
message pairings of the central tetrahedron. Because
their successive new edges are
noncongruent with the edges of the original tetrahedron,
the new edge will never be equal
to or rational with the original edge. Though they produce
a smooth-curve, ascending
progression, they will always be shorter<SUP>&#95;&#95;</SUP>but only a
very little bit shorter<SUP>&#95;&#95;</SUP>than twice the
length of the original edge vectors. Perhaps this shortness
may equate with the shortening
of radial vectors in the transition from the vector
equilibrium's diameter to the
icosahedron's diameter. (See Sec.
 <A HREF="../s04/p6000.html#460.00">460</A>, Symmetrical Contraction
of Vector Equilibrium.)
This is at least a contraction of similar magnitude,
and mathematical analyses may show
that it is indeed the size of the icosahedron's diameter.
The new edge of the star
tetrahedron may be the same as the reduced radius of
the icosahedron. If it is, the star
tetrahedron could be the positron, as the icosahedron
seems to be the electron. These
relationships should be experimentally and trigonometrically
explored, as should all the
energy-experience inferences of synergetics. The identifications
become ever more
tantalizingly close.
