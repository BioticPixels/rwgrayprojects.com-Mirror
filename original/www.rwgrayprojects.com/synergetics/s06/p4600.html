 While tension and compression always and only coexist,
their respective
structural behaviors differ greatly. Structural columns
function most predominantly in
compression of inherent limit of length to cross section,
whereas tension cables or rods
have no cross section diameter-to-length ratio.

 As man's knowledge of chemical-element interalloying
improves, it becomes
apparent that critically effective, mass-attractive
atomic proximities are intensified by
symmetrical congruence. The mass attractions increase
as of the second power with each
halving of the distance of atomic interstices<SUP>&#95;&#95;</SUP>the length
of structural tensile members,
such as those of suspension bridge cables, relative
to a given cross section of cable
diameter or of any given stress. The overall lengths
trend to amplify in every-multiplying
degree, thus approaching infinite lengths with no cross
section at all. Incredible? No! Look
at the Moon and Earth flying coheringly around the Sun.
Every use of gravity is a use of
such <I>sectionless</I> tensioning. The electrical tensioning
first employed by man to pull energy
through the nonferrous conductors, and later to close
the wireless circuit, was none other
than such universally available sectionless tension.

 Gravitational behavior is an operational concept embracing
the following

<OL TYPE="1">
<LI> Spheres contain the most volume with the least surface.
<LI> Nature always employs only the most economical intertransformative
and
omnicosmically interrelated behavioral stratagems.
<LI> With each event in Universe there are always 12
unique degrees of freedom (see
Sec. <A HREF="../s05/p3700.html#537.06">537.06</A>).
<LI> Falling bodies manifest a mathematically uniform,
second-power, exponential rate
of acceleration (discovered by Galileo).
<LI> Hidden within the superficial disorder of individual
omnidifferences<SUP>&#95;&#95;</SUP>differences of
size; differences in distance from the Sun; and differences
in Sun-orbiting rates<SUP>&#95;&#95;</SUP>there
nonetheless exists an elegantly exact, one-to-one mathematical
correspondence in the
Sun's planets' intercoordinate behaviors manifest by
the equiareas of the radii- and arc-
bounded, piece-of-apple-pie-shaped, areal sweepouts,
within an identical time span, of all
the Sun's planets as they orbit elliptically around
the Sun at vast distances from one
another, all accomplished without any visible mechanical
interlinkage such as gears, yet
whose orbiting around the Sun (rather than flying off
tangentially from those orbits by
centrifugal force, as do the round iron balls released
by hammer-throwing athletes)
altogether suggests that some incredibly powerful interattractiveness
is operative. (All of
the foregoing planetary behavior was discovered by Kepler.
Compare Sec.
 <A HREF="../s07/p9000.html#791.01">791.01</A>.)
<LI> The above discoveries (1-5) were correlated by Newton
to reveal:
<BR>
<I>First,</I> that the prime interattractiveness magnitude
existing between two mutually
remote bodies, as compared to the prime interattractiveness
existing between any other
two mutually remote bodies, is arrived at by multiplying
each of the respective couples'
separate masses by one another; and
<BR>
<I>Second,</I> as a cosmic generalization of the second-power,
time-distance acceleration rate
of Galileo's Earthward-falling bodies, Newton discovered
the second-power mathematical
rate of interattractiveness gain occurring with each
halving of the intervening distance of
any two given celestial bodies; whereby it was thereafter
shown by other astronomers that
there are interrelationship behaviors manifest in physical
Universe that are in no wise
indicated to be interoperative between those bodies
by any or all of the unique and integral
geometrical, chemical, or physical characteristics of
any one of the mass-interattracted
bodies when either one is only separately considered.
<LI> Synergy means behavior of whole systems unpredicted
by the integral
characteristics of any of the systems' separate parts;
thus it has come to pass that it has
been synergetically <I>proven</I> that Copernicus was right,
for the exponentially ever-increasing
interattractiveness of bodies freed of other external
restraints must induce their ultimate
huddling together in the most economical volume-to-enclosing-surface
manner, which, as
the number of converging bodies increases, is that of
the <I>spherical</I> conformation.

 The spherical behavior of gravity is illustrated in
the trending series of
intertransforming events that would take place as two
large, independent spherical masses,
such as two asteroids, fell into one another and their
multitudinous individual atoms began
to sort themselves into most economical interarray.
Interestingly enough, this is the
opposite of what transpires with biological cell dichotomy.

 Speaking mathematically, the surface area growth is
always at a second-
power rate of increase in respect to the linear dimension's
rate of increase. As Newton's
linear distance apart was measured arithmetically, we
can understand systematically why
the relative interattraction of the bodies varies as
the second power, which represents their
relative surface rates of change, but this does not
explain why there is any interattraction.
Interattraction is eternally mysterious.

 <B>Circumferential Behavior of Gravity: Hammer Men and
Closest
Packing:</B> Sheet-metal workers never seem to think of
what they are doing in terms of
what their work does to the atoms, of the ways the atoms
accommodate to their work.
The hammer men have learned that they can gather the
metal together in a way that
hammers it thicker. It is easy to conceive of hammering
metals thinner, but few of us
would think spontaneously of hammering metals thicker.
But the hammer men are quite
able to do this, to hammer the metal in such a way as
to increase its bulk. They can start
with a flat sheet of metal and hammer it thicker, as
you would knead dough together after
it has been rolled out thin with a rolling pin. But
you push the dough together horizontally
with your hands; you do not pummel it vertically from
above. The skilled sheet-metal
workers can do just that with the metal, though amateurs
might assume it to be illogical, if
not impossible. (See Secs.
 <A HREF="../s10/p2000.html#1024.13">1024.13</A>

 We can conceive of heating metal until it becomes
liquid and flows together.
Thus the blacksmith's heating of his horseshoes to a
bright red, to a condition just short of
melting; this makes it easy for us to think of the cherry-red
metal as being in a plastic or
semimolten condition that permits the smith to smite
it into any preferred shapes<SUP>&#95;&#95;</SUP>thicker
or thinner. But the sheet-metal men hammer cold, hard
sheet metal into any shape without
preheating.

 What the hammer men do intuitively without sensing
it consciously is to hit
the indestructible atoms tangentially, as a billiards
player might "kiss" the object ball with
his cue ball. Thus does the hammer inadvertently impel
atoms sidewise, often to roll atop
the next-nearest "spherical" aggregate of atoms. The
aggregate of atoms is spherical
because of the electrons' orbiting combined with the
atoms' spinning at so high a rate as
usually to present a dynamically spherical surface.
Hammer men do not think about their
work as bounce-impelling the spherical atoms around
as if they were a bunch of
indestructible ball bearings stuck together magnetically,
as a consequence of which the
accelerated ball bearings would cleave-roll to relodge
themselves progressively in certain
most-economically-traveled-to, closest-packed, internested
rearrangements.

 Atoms dislodged from the outer layer of the omniintermagnetized
ball
bearings would always roll around on one another to
relocate themselves in some closest-
packing array, with any two mass-interattracted atoms
being at least in tangency. When
another dynamic-spherical-domain atom comes into closest-packing
tangency with the first
two, the mutual interattractiveness interrolls the three
to form a triangle. Three in a
triangle produce a "planar" pattern of closest packing.
When a fourth ball bearing lodges
in the nest formed between and atop the first three,
each of the four balls then touches
three others simultaneously and produces a tetrahedron
having a concave-faceted void
within it. In this tetrahedral position, with four-dimensional
symmetry of association, they
are in circumferential closest packing. Having no mutual
sphere, they are only
intercircumferentially mass-interattracted and cohered:
i.e., gravity alone coheres them,
but gravity is hereby seen experimentally to be exclusively
circumferential in interbonding.

 With further spherical atom additions to the initial
tetrahedral aggregate, the
outermost balls tend to roll coherently around into
asymmetrical closest-packing
collections, until they are once more symmetrically
stabilized with 12 closest packing
around one and as yet exercising their exclusively intercircumferential
interattractiveness,
bound circumferentially together by four symmetrically
interacting circular bands, whereby
each of the 12 surrounding spheres has four immediately
adjacent circumferential shell
spheres interattracting them circumferentially, while
there is only one central nuclear ball

this configuration they form the vector

 In the vector-equilibrium configuration of closest-packed,
"spherical" atoms
we have clarification of the <I>Copernican nostalgia,</I> or
synergetic proclivity, of the
circumferentially arrayed spheres to associate symmetrically
around the nucleus sphere or
the nucleus void, which, as either configuration<SUP>&#95;&#95;</SUP>the

we will discover synergetics' jitterbug
model (see Sec.

 showing that the 12 circumferential
spheres will closest pack
circumferentially until each of the 12 circumferentially
arrayed balls is tangent to five
surrounding balls, and thus they altogether form the

 Gravity has been described by Arthur Koestler as the
nostalgia of things to
become spheres. The nostalgia is poetic, but the phenomenon
is really more of a necessity
than it is a nostalgia. Spheres contain the most volume

circumferential: Nature is always most economical. Gravity
is the most effective
embracement. Gravity behaves spherically <I>of necessity,</I>

 The hammer man probably does not think about these
properties of atoms.
The fact is that the spheres do not actually touch each
other. They are held together only
mass-interattractively, and their electron paths are
of course at distances from their atomic
nuclei equivalent relatively to that of the distance
of the Earth from the Sun, as
proportioned to the respective radii of these vastly
different-sized spheres. Thus the
hammer man can push the atoms only as the physical laws
allow them to be moved.
Nature accommodates his only-superficially contrived
hammering strategies, while all the
time all those atoms are intercohered by gravity<SUP>&#95;&#95;</SUP>which
the hammer associates only with
falling objects. Almost nothing of the reality of our
present life meets the human eye;
wherefore our most important problems are invisible.

 Because tension is ever a spiraling arc, it must close
back upon itself; it is,
therefore, finite and cohesive. Universe is inherently
finite and a comprehensive integrity.
Compression systems tend, when compression-loaded, to
yield to arcs of lesser radius and
also, by precessional axial despiraling, tend to unravel
and to separate into a plurality of
subsystems. Tension systems tend, when axially loaded,
to arcs of greater radius. Tension
systems tend to greater cohesiveness of precessional

from one another in respect to their measurable local-energy-concentration
diameters, and
all are bounded together by a comprehensive but invisible
tensional integrity.

 In the new awareness of synergetics, the remote patternings
of Universe are
inherently finite, and only the local islands of compression
are subdivisible to the degree of
infinity projected by the existence of local life and
its differential dichotomies of
progressive probing. We discover that the more visible,
i.e., the more sensorially tunable,
the structural functions are, then the more infinitely
subdivisible do their potential
treatments become. The more invisible the structural
functions of Universe, the more
comprehensively and comprehendably finite they become.

 As a consequence of these macro-micro structural observations,
I also
wondered whether man was congenitally limited to his
solid structural conceptioning. Man
obviously tended to think only of a "solid," brick-on-brick,
pile-up law as governing all
fundamental forms of structural modifications, i.e.,
formal local alterations of the "solid"
compressional Earth's crust. Could he therefore never
participate in the far more efficient
structural strategies evidenced in his (only instrumentally
harvested) infra- and
ultrasensorial data of universal patterning? I saw that
man had long known of tensional
structures and had experienced and developed tensional
capabilities, but apparently only as
a secondary accessory of primary compressional structuring.

 Conventional engineering analysis long ago discovered
that a two-way,
vertically sectioned beam crossing at 90 degrees, supported
from four walls, provided no
more strength at the mid-crossing point than could be
found in the stronger of the two
beams, for they were redundantly acting as hinges, and
only one axis of hinging could be
articulated at one time.

 In three-way beam crossings, each vertically sectioned
beam has a two-way
tendency to rock or torque or hinge over from its most
favorable aspect of maximum
dimension in opposition to gravity into its least favorable
aspect, that of least dimension in
opposition to gravity. As each beam could hinge from
the vertical in two ways, each may
be split theoretically into two vertical parts and thus
hinge both ways. The three-way beam
crossing is thus countered by the simultaneous and symmetrical
both-ways split rocking of
all three vertical split-beam hinges<SUP>&#95;&#95;</SUP>as three sets of
parallel planes until their edges meet
in ridge poles to provide a matrix of tetrahedra, with
common lean-to stability and with
maximum energy-repose economy, synergetically between
a fourth<SUP>&#95;&#95;</SUP>or horizontal<SUP>&#95;&#95;</SUP>set of
planes.

 While the three beams' sets of uniquely split plus-and-minus
vertical planes
rotate into three positive-and-negative parallel sets
of planes at 35&deg; 16' off vertical, each
of the tilted beam's tops and bottoms is in two parallel
and horizontal planes, respectively.
This makes a total of four unique and symmetrically
oriented planes within the system.
Where the four unique sets of planes intercept each
other, there is established a system of
interconnected lines; as the interconnected lines contain
all the stress patternings, struts
may be substituted for them and the planar webs may
then be eliminated. When struts
alone are used for horizontal decking, they are designed
to receive loads at their vertexial
ends and to send their loads through their neutral axis,
whereas beams inefficiently take
loads anywhere at 90 degrees to their neutral axes.

 In the octet truss, three planes of beams and their
triangularly binding edge
patterns rotate tepee-wise<SUP>3</SUP> positively and negatively
to nonredundant ridge-pole fixity,
and with such symmetry as to result in radial distribution
of all loads from any one loaded
vertex through the neutral axes of all the edges of
the system. Loads are precessionally
differentiated as either pure-compression or pure-tension
stresses. They are metered at
even rates because their edge vectors are identical
in length. The loads precess further into
positive and negative radial and circumferential waves
eccentric to the loaded vertex, with
the stress distributed positively and negatively throughout
those adjacent vertexes
surrounding any one loading center, and with the wave
distribution in all directions
precessing into tensile action the concentric series
of rings around the originally loaded
vertex. The increasing succession of concentric rings
that continually redistribute the
received loads act in themselves as unitary systems,
with an increasing number of
eccentrically distributive vectors as full-dispersion
loads come to symmetric
reconcentration at supporting areas in direct pattern
reversal. (See Secs.

 The octet truss is synergetic because the four planes
comprise a system, and
what were previously individual beams, and therefore
free systems in themselves, are now
fixed components in a larger tetrahedral system, which
is inherently nonredundant because
it is the minimum fixed system. Ergo, all those previous
individual, free-system beams are
now converted into one nonredundant complex of basic
systems, and all the previous
beams' component biological and subchemical structures
are systematically refocused in
such a manner that all subcomponents are nonredundantly
interactive in the second-power
rates of effectiveness accruing to the circumferential
finiteness of systems in respect to
their radial modules.

 The unitary, systematic, nonredundant, octet-truss
complex provides a total
floor system with higher structural performance abilities
than engineers could possibly
ascribe to it through conventional structural analysis
predicated only upon the behavior of
its several parts. It is axiomatic to conventional engineering
that if parts are "horizontal,"
they are beams; and the total floor ability by such
conventional engineering could be no
stronger than the single strongest beam in the plural
group. Thus their prediction falls
short of the true behavior of the octet truss by many
magnitudes, for in true mathematical
fact, no "beams" are left in the complex; that is, there
are no members in it loaded at other
than polar terminals. Down to the minutest atomic components,
the octet truss is therefore
proved to be synergetic, and its discovery as a structure<SUP>&#95;&#95;</SUP>in
contradistinction to its
aesthetic or superficial appearance<SUP>&#95;&#95;</SUP>is synergetic in
performance; that is, its behavior as a
whole is unpredicted by its parts. This makes its discovery
as a structure a true surprise,
and therefore it is a true invention.

 What is the surprise? It is because we had used three
planes of the beams
oriented to most favorable ability aspect in respect
to gravity, and in so doing we had
inadvertently gained a fourth interacting favorable-aspect
plane of symmetry not
consciously introduced as a previously acquired component
of the whole, which thereby
made the beams "vanish" into abstract limbo. The fourth
plane is strictly the fourth plane
of the tetrahedron inadvertently accruing, as does the
hinging on of one triangle to two
previously hinged equilateral triangles provide inadvertently
a fourth triangle: 1 + 2 = 4.

 A second derivative surprise is the nonredundance
of the larger associated
complex of tetrahedra, occasioned by its precessionally
induced self-differentiation of
functions: when loaded at any one vertex in such a manner
that every member acts in
axially focused pure tension or pure compression, and
with the subsequent loading of any
next adjacent vertex, there is inherently induced comprehensive
reversal of all the system's
pure tension into pure compression functions, and vice
versa. That is to say, it is
dynamically nonredundant.
