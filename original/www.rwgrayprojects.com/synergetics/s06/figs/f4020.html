<TR><TD>Fig. 640.20 Compression Members Under Stress: A cigar
shape (A) (with radials short and compact)
under pressure in its long axes goes to squash shape
(B) (radials long and separating) or to banana shape
(C) (radials longer and collecting). Note that on the
squash the stretching edge gets thinner and breaks.
The cigar (D) has only one neutral axis: axial or polar
exaggerated asymmetry. The sphere (E) has an
infinity of equi-neutral axes: symmetry. The disc (F)
has only one neutral axis: equatorially exaggerated
asymmetry. Compression columns (G) tend toward axes
of ever lesser radius. As columns become longer
in respect to their cross section (slenderness ratio)
they tend to flex and break into two shorter columns
in
an attempt to restore a desirable slenderness ratio.
