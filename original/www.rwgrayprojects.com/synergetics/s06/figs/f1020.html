<TR><TD>Fig. 610.20 The Three Basic Structural Systems in Nature
with Three, Four or Five Triangles at Each
Vertex:
There are only three possible cases of fundamental omnisymmetrical,
omnitriangulated, least-effort
structural systems in nature: the tetrahedron with three
triangles at each vertex, the octahedron with four
triangles at each vertex, and the icosahedron with five
triangles at each vertex. If there are six equilateral
triangles around a vertex we cannot define a three-dimensional
structural system, only a "plane." The left
column shows the minimum three triangles at a vertex
forming the tetrahedron through to the six
triangles at a vertex forming an "infinite plane." The
center column shows the planar polyhedra. The
right column shows the same polyhedra in spherical form.
