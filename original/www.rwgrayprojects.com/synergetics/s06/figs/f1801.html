<TR><TD>Fig. 618.01: The tetrahedron would have to turn itself
completely inside out (A), and as this constitutes
a
complete change in the entire structure (with no localized
effect in evidence) the tetrahedron clearly has
the greatest resistance of any structure to externally
applied concentrated load. The octahedron dimples
in on itself (B), and the icosahedron (C), although
dimpling locally, does reduce its volume considerably
when doing so, implying that it still has good resistance
to concentrated load. The geodesic spheres (D
and E) exhibit "very local" dimpling as the frequency
increases, suggesting much less resistance to
concentrated loads but very high resistance to distributed
loads.
