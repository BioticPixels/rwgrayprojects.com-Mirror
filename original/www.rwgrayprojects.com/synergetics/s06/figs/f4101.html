<TR><TD>Fig. 641.01 Tension Members Tend Toward Arcs of Ever
Greater Radius:
<OL TYPE="A">
<LI> Slack rope and tensed rope: tensed rope tends toward
"straight," i.e. toward arcs of ever greater
radius, but never attains complete "straightness."
<LI> As tension increases: neutral axis lengthens and
girth contracts (becomes more compact). Therefore,
the long-dimension profile arcs increase in radius and
spiral arcs' "radii" increase in dimensions but
never attain "straightness" of relation between two
"fixed" points, as there are no experiences of
fixed points and straight points.
<LI> Tension goes toward arcing of larger and fewer different
radii all ultimately spirally closing back on
self. Tension: inherently comprehensive and finite.
Compression goes toward relatively smaller
radius and toward more of smaller and multiplying microcosmic
differentiation. Compression:
inherently local and infinite.
<LI> Tension as gravity: a tension structure is nature's
fundamental pattern-cohering principle.
