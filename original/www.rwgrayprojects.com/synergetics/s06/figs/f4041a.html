<TR><TD>Fig. 640.41A Stabilization of tension: Minimum of 12
Spokes:
<OL TYPE="A">
<LI> A solid mast without stays stands erect by itself
in "solid" earth. Tension stays may be added at end
of the lever arm helping against hurricane "uprooting."
Men have until now employed a compression
continuity as the primary load-carrying structural system
with tension employed secondarily to
stabilize angular relationships.
<LI> The old artillery wheel provides a series of vaulting
poles.
<LI> Pole vaulting along, a "pushing-up" load.
<LI> Hanging in tension like the wire wheel.
<LI> The wire wheel provides a series of tension clings.
The axle load of the wire wheel is hung from the
top of the wheel, which tries to belly out, so spokes
as additional tension members are added
horizontally to keep it from bellying.
<LI> It takes a minimum of 12 spokes to fix the hub position
in relation to the rim: six positive diaphragm
and six negative diaphragm, of which respectively three
each are positively and negatively opposed
turbining torque members.
<LI>Many spokes keep rim from bending outwardly any further
while load is suspended by central
vertical spokes successively leading from top of wheel
to hub and its load.
