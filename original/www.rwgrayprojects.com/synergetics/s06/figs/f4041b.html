<TR><TD>Fig. 640.41B Minimum of Twelve Spokes Oppose Torque:
Universal Joint:
<OL TYPE="A">
<LI> It takes a minimum of 12 spokes to overcome the turbining
evident with the minimum four vectors of
restraint. This is demonstrated with the 12-spoke wire
wheel with its six positive diaphragm and six
negative diaphragm of which respectively three each
are positively and negatively opposed turbining
or torque members.
<LI> Two-axis and three-axis "universal joints," analogous
to the wire wheel as a basic system relying on
the differentiation of tension and compression for its
effectiveness. These all may be considered basic
tensegrity systems.
