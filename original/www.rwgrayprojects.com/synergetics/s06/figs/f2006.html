<TR><TD>Fig. 620.06 Tetrahedron as Vectorial Model of Quantum:
The tetrahedron as a basic vectorial model is
the fundamental structural system of the Universe. The
open-ended triangular spiral as action, reaction,
and resultant (proton, electron, and anti-neutrino;
or neutron, positron, and neutrino) becomes half
quantum. An association of positive and negative half-quantum
units identifies the tetrahedron as one
quantum.
