 It is a tendency for patterns either to repeat themselves
locally or for their
parts to separate out to join singly or severally with
other patterns to form new
constellations. All the forces operative in Universe
result in a complex progression of most
comfortable<SUP>&#95;&#95;</SUP>i.e., least effort, rearrangings in which
the macro-medio-micro star events
stand dynamically together here and there as locally
regenerative patterns. Spontaneously
regenerative local constellations are cosmic, since
they appear to be interoriented with
angular constancy.

all the way from whole Universe to lesser and local
pattern differentiations all the way into
the atom and its nuclear subassemblies. Each of the

 One of the deeply impressive things about structures
is that they cohere at
all-particularly when we begin to know something about
the atoms and realize that the
components of atoms are really very remote from one
another, so that we simply have
galaxies of events. Man is deceiving himself when he
sees anything "solid" in structures.

 A necklace is unstable. The beads of a necklace may
be superficially
dissimilar, but they all have similar tubes running
through them with the closed tension
string leading through all the tubes. The simplest necklace
would be one made only of
externally undecorated tubes and of tubes all of the
same length. As the overall shape of
the necklace changes to any and all polygonal shapes
and wavy drapings, we discover that
the lengths of the beads in a necklace do not change.
Only the angles between the tubes
change. Therefore, <I>stable</I> refers only to angular invariability.

 A six-edged polygon is unstable; it forms a drapable
necklace. If we make a
five-sided polygon, i.e., a pentagonal necklace, it
is unstable. It, too, is a drapable necklace
and is structurally unstable. Why? A necklace of three
rigid tubes also has three flexible
angle-accommodating tension joints. Here are six separate
parts, each with its unique
behavior characteristics which self-interfere to produce
a stable pattern. How and why?
We are familiar with the principle of lever advantage
gained per length of lever arm from
the fulcrum. We are familiar with the principle of the
shears in which two levers share a
common fulcrum, and the stronger and longer the shear
arms, the more powerfully do they
cut. Steel-bolt cutters have long lever arms.

 In every triangle each comer angle tension connector
serves as the common
interfulcrum of the two push-pull, rigid lever arms
comprising two of the three sides of the
triangle adjacent to their respectively common angular
corners; each pair of the triangle's
tubular necklace sides, in respect to a given corner
of the triangle, represent levers whose
maximum-advantage ends are seized by the two ends of
the third, rigid, push-pull, tubular
side of the triangle, whose rigidity is imposed by its
command of the two lever arm ends
upon the otherwise flexible opposite angle. Thus we
find that each of the necklace's
triangular rigid tube sides stabilizes its opposite
angle with minimum effort by controlling
the ends of the two levers fulcrumed by that opposite
tension fastening of the triangle.
Thus we find the triangle to be not only the unique
pattern-self-stabilizing, multienergied
complex, but also accomplishing pattern stabilization
at minimum effort, which behavior
coincides with science's discovery of the omni-minimum-effort
behavior of all physical
Universe .

 The six independent energy units of the triangle that
interact to produce
pattern stability are the only plural polygon-surrounding,
energy-event complexes to
produce stabilized patterns. (The necklace corners can
be fastened together with three
separate tension-connectors, instead of by the string
running all the way through the tubes,
wherefore the three rigid tubes and the three flexible
tension connectors are six unique,
independent, energy events.)

 Since tension and compression always and only coexist
(See Sec.
 <A HREF="p4000.html#640.00">640</A>) with
first one at high tide and the other at low tide, and
then vice versa, the necklace tubes are
rigid with compression at visible high tide and tension
at invisible low tide; and each of the
tension-connectors has compression at invisible low
tide and tension at visible high tide;
ergo, each triangle has both a positive and a negative
triangle congruently coexistent and
each visible triangle is two triangles: one visible
and one invisible.

 We undertake experimental and progressive reduction
of the tubularly
beaded necklace's multipolygonal flexibility. The reduction
is accomplished by progressive
one-by-one elimination of tubes from the assembly. The
progressive elimination alters the
remaining necklace assemblage from a condition of extreme
accommodation of contouring
intimacies and drapability over complexedly irregular,
multidimensional forms until the
assembly gradually approaches a number of remaining
tubes whose magnitude can be
swiftly assessed without much conscious counting. As
the multipolygonal assembly
approaches a low-number magnitude of components of the
polygons, it becomes
recognizable that an <I>even</I> number of remaining tubes
can be arranged in a symmetrical
totality of inward-outward, inward-outward points, producing
a corona or radiant starlike
patterning, or the patterning of the extreme crests
and troughs of a circular wave. When
the number of tubular beads is <I>odd,</I> however, then the
extra tube can only be
accommodated by either a crest-to-crest or a trough-to-trough
chord of the circle. This is
the pattern of a gear with one odd double-space tooth
in each circle. If the extra length is
used to join two adjacent crests chordally, this tooth
could mesh cyclically as a gear only
with an equal number of similarly toothed gears of slightly
larger diameter, where the extra
length is used to interconnect the two adjacent troughs
chordally. (See Fig.

 Next in familiarity of the reduced numbers of circular
division increments
comes the 12 hours of the clock. Then the decimal system's
azimuthal circle of 10 with 10
secondary divisions. Circles of nine are unfamiliar.
But the octagon's division is highly
familiar and quickly recognized. Septagons are not.
Powerfully familiar and instantly
recognized are the remaining hexagon, pentagon, square,
and triangle. There is no
twogon. Triangle is the minimum polygon. Triangle is
the minimum-limit case.

 All the necklace polygons prior to the triangle are
flexibly drapable and
omnidirectionally flexible with the sometimes-square-sometimes-diamond,
four-tube
necklace as the minimum-limit case of parallel bundling
of the tubes. The triangle, being
odd in number, cannot be bundled and thus remains not
only the minimum polygon but the
only inflexible, nonfoldable polygon.

 In Euclidean geometry triangles and other polygons
were misinformedly
thought of as occurring in two-dimensional planes. The
substanceless, no-altitude, planar
polygons were thought to hold their shape<SUP>&#95;&#95;</SUP>as did any
polygonal shape traced on the
Earth's surface<SUP>&#95;&#95;</SUP>ignoring the fact that the shape of
any polygon of more than three edges
is maintained only by the four-dimensional understructuring.
Only the triangle has an
inherent and integral structural integrity.

 The triangular necklace is not two-dimensional, however;
like all
experienceable structural entities it is four-dimensional,
as must be all experienceably
realized polygonal models even though the beads are
of chalk held together by the tensile
coherence of the blackboard. Triangles at their simplest
consist experientially of one
minimum-altitude tetrahedron.
