 One cannot patent geometry per se nor any separately
differentiated out,
pure principle of nature's operative processes. One
can patent, however, the surprise
complex behaviors of associated principles where the
behavior of the whole is unpredicted
by the behavior of the parts, i.e., synergetic phenomena.
This is known as invention, a
complex arrangement not found in, but permitted by,
nature, though it is sometimes
superficially akin to a priori natural systems, formulations,
and processes. Though
superficially similar in patternings to radiolaria and
flies' eyes, geodesic structuring is true
invention. Radiolaria collapse when taken out of water.
Flies' eyes do not provide human-
dwelling precedent or man-occupiable, environment-valving
structures.

 Until the introduction of geodesic structures, structural
analysis and
engineering-design strategies regarding clear-span structural
enclosures in general, and
domical structures in particular, were predicated upon
the stress analysis of individual
beams, columns, and cantilevers as separate components
and thereafter as a solid
compressional shell with no one local part receiving
much, if any, aid from other parts.
Their primarily compressional totality was aided here
and there by tensional sinews, but
tension was a discontinuous local aid and subordinate.
As academically constituted in the
middle of this 20th-century, engineering could in no
way predict, let alone rely upon, the
synergetic behaviors of geodesics in which any one,
several, or many of the components
could be interchangeably removed without in any way
jeopardizing the structural-integrity
cohering of the remaining structure. Engineering was,
therefore, and as yet is, utterly
unable to analyze effectively and correctly tensegrity
geodesic structural spheres in which
none of the compression members ever touch one another
and only the tension is
continuous.

 It appeared and as yet appears to follow, in conventional,
state-licensed
structural engineering, that if tension is secondary
and local in all men's structural
projections, that tension must also be secondary in
man's philosophic reasoning. As a
consequence, the popular conception of airplane flight
was, at first and for a long time,
erroneously explained as a compressional push-up force
operating under the plane's wing.
It "apparently" progressively compressed the air below
it, as a ski compresses the snow
into a grooved track of icy slidability. The scientific
fact remains, as wind-tunnel
experiments proved, that three-quarters of the airplane's
weight support is furnished by
the negative lift of the partial vacuum created atop
the airfoil. This is simply because, as
Bernoulli showed, it is longer for the air to go around
the top of the foil than under the
foil, and so the same amount of air in the same amount
of time had to be stretched thinner,
ergo vacuously, over the top. This stretching thinner
of the air, and its concomitant greater
effectiveness of interpositioning of bodies (that is,
the airplane in respect to Earth), is our
same friend, the astro- and nucleic-tensional integrity
of dynamic interpatterning causality.

 <B>Slenderness Ratio:</B> Compression members have a limit
ratio of length to
section: we call it the slenderness ratio. The compression
member may very readily break
if it is too long. But there is no limit of cross section
to length in a tension member; there
is no inherent ratio.

 The Greeks, who built entirely in compression, discovered
that a stone
column's slenderness ratio was approximately 18 to 1,
length to diameter. Modern
structural-steel columns, with an integral tensional
fibering unpossessed by these stone
columns, have a limit slenderness ratio of approximately
33 to 1. If we have better
metallurgical alloys, we can make longer and longer
tension members with less and less
section<SUP>&#95;&#95;</SUP>apparently ad infinitum. But we cannot make
longer compression columns ad
infinitum.

 If we try to load a slender column axially<SUP>&#95;&#95;</SUP>for instance,
a 36-inch-long by
l/8-inch-diameter steel rod<SUP>&#95;&#95;</SUP>it tends to bend in any
direction away from its neutral axis. If,
however, we take a six-inch-diameter bundle of 36-inch-long
by 1/8-inch-diameter rods
compacted parallel to one another into a closest-packed,
hexagonally cross-sectioned
bundle, bind them tensionally with circumferential straps
in planes at 90 degrees to the axis
of the rods, around the bundle's six-inch girth, and
then cap both ends of the tightly
compacted, hexagonally cross-sectioned bundle with tightly
fitting, forged-steel,
hexagonal caps, we will have a bundle that will act
together as a column. If we now load
this 36-inch-high column axially under an hydraulic
press, we discover that because each
rod could by itself be easily bent, but they cannot
bend toward one another because closest
packed, they therefore bend away from one another as
well as twisting circumferentially
into an ever-fattening, twisting cigar that ultimately
bursts its girth-tensed bonds. So we
discover that our purposeful compressing axially of
the bundle column is resulting in
tension being created at 90 degrees to our purposeful
compressing.

 Sphere: An Island of Compression: Aiming of the compressional
loading
of a short column into the neutral or central-most axis
of the column provides the greatest
columnar resistance to the compressing because, being
the neutral axis, it brings in the
most mass coherence to oppose the force. To make a local
and symmetrical island of
compression from a short column that axial loading has
progressively twisted and
expanded at girth into a cigar shape, you have to load
it additionally along its neutral axis
until the ever-fattening cigar shape squashes into a
sphere. In the spherical condition, for
the first and only time, any axis of the structure is
neutral<SUP>&#95;&#95;</SUP>or in its most effective
resistant-to-compression attitude. It is everywhere
at highest compression and tension-
resisting capability to withstand any forces acting
upon it.

 It is not surprising, in view of these properties,
that ball bearings prove to be
the most efficient compression members known to and
ever designedly produced by man.
Nor are we surprised to find all the planets and stars
to be approximately spherical mass
aggregations, as also are the atoms, all of which spherical
islands of the macrocosmic and
microcosmic aspects of scenario Universe provide the
comprehensive, invisible, tensional,
gravitational, electromagnetic, and amorphous integrity
of Universe with complementarily
balancing internality of compressionally most effective,
locally and temporarily visible,
islanded compressional entities. It is also not surprising,
therefore, that Universe islands its
spherical compression aggregates and coheres the whole
exclusively with tension;
discontinuous compression and continuous tension: I
call this tensional integrity of
Universe <I>tensegrity.</I>

 <B>Precession and Critical Proximity:</B> Compressions are
always local and,
when axially increased beyond the column-into-cigar-into-sphere
stage of optimum
compression-resisting effectiveness, they tend toward
edge-sinused, lozenge shapes, then
into edge-fractionated discs, and thereafter into a
plurality of separately and visibly
identifiable entities separating inwardly in a plane
at 90 degrees to the compressional
forces as the previously neighboring atoms became precessionally
separated from one
another beyond the critical threshold between the falling-inward,
massive integrity
coherence proclivities of islanded "matter"<SUP>&#95;&#95;</SUP>beyond that
proclivity threshold of critical
proximity, now to yield precessionally at 90 degrees
to participate in the remotely orbiting
patterns characterizing 99.99 percent of all the celestially
accountable time-distance void
of known Universe.

 <B>Wire Wheel:</B> In the high- and low-tide cooperative
precessional
functionings of tension versus compression, I saw that
there are times when each are at
half tide, or equally prominent in their system relationships.
I saw that the exterior of the
equatorial compressional island rim-atoll of the wire
wheel must be cross-sectionally in
tension as also must be its hub-island's girth. I also
saw that all these tension-vs-
compression patterning relationships are completely
reversible, and are entirely reversed,
as when we consider the compressively spoked artillery
wheel vs. the tensionally spoked
wire wheel. I followed through with the consideration
of these differentiable, yet
complementarily reversible, functions of structural
systems as possibly disclosing the
minimum or fundamental set of differentiability of nonredundant,
precessionally
regenerative structural systems. (See Sec.

 As I considered the 12 unique vectors of freedom constantly
and
nonredundantly operative between the two poles of the
wire wheel<SUP>&#95;&#95;</SUP>its islanded hub and
its islanded equatorial rim-atoll, in effect a Milky
Way-like ring of a myriad of star islands
encircling the hub in a plane perpendicular to the hub
axis<SUP>&#95;&#95;</SUP>I discerned that this most
economic arrangement of forces might also be that minimum
possible system of nature
capable of displaying a stable constellar compressional
discontinuity and tensional
continuity. A one-island system of compression would
be an inherently continuous
compression system, with tension playing only a redundant
and secondary part. Therefore,
a one-island system may be considered only as an optically
illusory "unitary" system, for,
of course, at the invisible level of atomic structuring,
the coherence of the myriad atomic
archipelagos of the "single" pebble's compression-island's
mass is sum-totally and only
provided by comprehensively continuous tension. This
fact was invisible to, and unthought
of by, historical man up to yesterday. Before the discovery
of this fact in mid-20th-
century, there was naught to disturb, challenge, or
dissolve his "solid-rock" and other
"solid-things" thinking. "Solid thinking" is as yet
comprehensively popular and is even
dominant over the practical considerations of scientists
in general, and even over the
everyday logic of many otherwise elegantly self-disciplined
nuclear physicists.

 As I wondered whether it was now possible for man
to inaugurate an era of
thinking and conscious designing in terms of comprehensive
tension and discontinuous
compression, I saw that his structural conceptioning
of the wire wheel documented his
intellectual designing breakthrough into such thinking
and structuring. The compressional
hub of the wire wheel is clearly islanded or isolated
from the compressional "atoll"
comprising the rim of the wheel. The compressional islands
are interpositioned in
structural stability only by the tensional spokes. This
is clearly a tensional integrity, where
tension is primary and comprehensive and compression
is secondary and local. This
reverses the historical structural strategy of man.
His first wire wheel had many and varied
numbers of spokes. From mathematical probing of generalized
principles and
experimentally proven knowledge governing the tensional
integrity of the wire wheel, we
discover that 12 is the minimum number of spokes necessary
for wire wheel stability. (See

 <B>Mast in the Earth:</B> In his primary regard for compressional
structuring,
man inserts a solid mast into a hole in the "solid"
Earth and rams it in as a solid continuity
of the unitary solid Earth. In order to keep the wind
from getting hold of the top of the
mast and breaking it when the hurricane rages, he puts
tension members in the directions
of the various winds acting at the ends of the levers
to keep it from being pulled over. The
set of tension stays is triangulated from the top of
the masthead to the ground, thus taking
hold of the extreme ends of the potential mast-lever
at the point of highest advantage
against motion. (See illustration
 <A HREF="p4000.html#640.41">640.41A</A>.) In this
way, tension becomes the helper. But
these tensions are secondary structuring actions. They
are also secondary adjuncts in
man's solidly built, compressional-continuity ships.
He puts in a solid mast and then adds
tension helpers as shrouds. To man, building, Earth,
and ship seemed alike,
compressionally continuous. Tension has been secondary
in all man's building and
compression has been primary, for he has always thought
of compression as solid.
Compression is that "realistic hard core" that men love
to refer to, and its reality was
universal, ergo comprehensive. Man must now break out
of that habit and learn to play at
nature's game where tension is primary and where tension
explains the coherence of the
whole. Compression is convenient, very convenient, but
always secondary and
discontinuous.

 <B>Tensed Rope:</B> There is a unique difference in the behaviors
of tension and
compression. When we take a coil of rope of twisted
hemp and pull its ends away from
one another, it both uncoils along its whole length
and untwists locally in its body. This is
to say that a tensed rope or tensed object tends to
open its arcs of local curvation into arcs
of ever greater radius. But we find that the rope never
attains complete straightness either
of its whole length or of its separate local fibers
or threads. Ropes are complexes of
spirals. Tensed mediums tend to a decreasing plurality
of arcs, each of the remainder
continually tending to greater radius but never attaining
absolute straightness, being
always affected in their overall length by other forces
operating upon them. We see that
tension members keep doing bigger and bigger arc tasks.
The big patterns of Universe are
large-radius patterns, and the small patterns are small-radius
patterns. Compressed
columns tend to spiral-arc complexes of ever-increasing
radius. So we find the
compression complexes tend to do the small local structural
tasks in Universe, and the
tension complexes tend to do the large structural tasks
in Universe. As tension accounts
for the large patternings and pattern integrities, compression
trends into locally small
pattern integrities.
