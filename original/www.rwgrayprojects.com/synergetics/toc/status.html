<p>
The 2 most common comments I have received most often with respect to <b><i>Synergetics</i></b>
on my web pages are: 1) How can I print a copy, and 2) There are 3 figures and tables 
missing.
</p>

<p>
I have imported the <b><i>Synergetics</i></b> web pages into Adobe Acrobat and created PDF files.
There are now links to these PDF files for printing.  You will need to install the Adobe PDF
Reader web browser plugin to access these files. (The Adobe PDF Reader is free.)
</p>

<p>
Note that this provides a way to print the <i>web pages</i>, and not a "print
quality, book format" version of <b><i>Synergetics</i></b>.  This means that the images are all 
web quality, not print quality. I am well aware that web browsers have a print 
option, but, in my experience, the format of such printing can be very poor, to the point 
of splitting a single line of text onto 2 separate printed pages.  The PDF 
version is a little better formated when printed.
</p>

<p>
The Color Plates, posters, and drawing sections have not been converted to PDF files for 
printing.  This is because, as I mentioned above, the images I have are only web
quality images, not print quality images.  Therefore, when I tried to import these images and 
print them out, the quality was so poor it was not worth pursuing.  
</p>

<p>
I have also removed the HTML "frame" presentation of these web pages.  HTML frames 
were originally used to provide a menu of options at the bottom of each page.  This has
prevented people from linking directly to numbered sections within <b><i>Synergetics</i></b>. 
The menu of options has been replaced with JavaScript code and Cascading Style Sheet.
This requires that JavaScript be enabled in the web browser. 
</p>

<p>
The missing figures and tables have been included.
</p>

<p>
A text searching capability is planned, but has not been implemented yet.
</p>

<p>
I have recentely moved the <b><i>Synergetics</i></b> web pages onto my own web server.
This provides me with far more disk space than the ISP I was using to host my
web site.  Having my own web server provided the space I needed for storing the PDF files 
for the print option.  Unfortunately, my web connection is a little slow, so downloading
web pages with lots or large images (or downloading large PDF files) is slow.

<P>
Work on finishing web Synergetics continues but is slow because
of other commitments that I have.  I have been able to find the
time to make the following changes/corrections:
<UL>
<LI><I>All</I> of the intra-document links should now be correct.  If you
    <I>any</I> links which are not correct, please let me know.
<LI>I have begun a "Comments on Synergetics" web page.  These are a
selection of comments, observations, counter examples, etc.
that people have made on various lists about specific
passages in Synergetics.
</UL>
</P>

<P>
I would like to thank Chris Fearnley for setting up a mirror site
for Synergetics.  It may be reached at ().
(02-05-2002: Chris informs me that the mirror site is no longer available.)
