 Humans are often spoken of as behaving like animals.
Vast experimental
study of animal reflexes and proclivities has disclosed
reliable benign behaviors to be
predictable when the creatures' vital necessities are
both habitually and readily available
well within critical limits of safe, healthy input periodicities
of the chromosomically and
DNA-RNA programmed optimum metabolic processing of the
subject species creatures.

 Such scientifically conducted zoological behavior
studies use the words
<I>reward</I> and <I>punishment.</I> By the word <I>reward</I> they do not
refer to a gold medal. And their
word <I>punishment</I> does not refer to whipping. The animal
behavior scientist's word <I>reward</I>
means that the creature is acquiring the vital life-support
chemistries of air, food, and
water well within the critical metabolic timing tolerance.
Punishment, to these scientists,
means that the creature's subconsciously generated hunger,
thirst, and respiratory instincts
are not met within comfortably tolerable time limits,
whereafter the creature panics. Its
original subconscious, spontaneous, innate trust that
its environment will always provide
what it wants and needs exactly when it is needed having
been violated, the creature
panics, and forever after its behavior pattern is unpredictable.

 It is clear that with the pushing of the panic button
a secondary act of
subconscious behavior controls has been activated. It
is one of the self-disciplined
responsibilities of comprehensive, anticipatory design
science always to include fail-safe ,
automatically switched-in, alternate circuitry for mechanical
functioning whenever a
prime-function facility is found wanting. When a series
of failures has blown out all the
alternate circuits' fuses, then a sense of lethal frustration
sets in that is identified as panic.
Once panicked, the individuals<SUP>&#95;&#95;</SUP>creatures or humans<SUP>&#95;&#95;</SUP>tend
to trust nothing, and their
behavior then becomes utterly unpredictable. They become
spontaneously suspicious of
their environment in general and prone to be spontaneously
hostile and aggressive.

 When they are aggressive<SUP>&#95;&#95;</SUP>or even worse, when they
panic<SUP>&#95;&#95;</SUP>both humans
and animals demonstrate a subconscious drive only for
self-survival. For instance, when a
great theater fire disaster occurs and the flames quickly
exhaust all the oxygen, people
suffocate within two minutes. When the fire is over
and many of the human dead are found
inside unscorched, their deaths having been caused by
suffocation, we discover that the
otherwise loving fathers lost personal consciousness
and stampeded over their own
children and crushed them to death<SUP>&#95;&#95;</SUP>the children for
whom the conscious fathers would
gladly have given their lives a hundred times over.

 This frustratedly insecure or panicked animal survival
drive is not a primary
human behavior; it is only a secondary, subordinate,
"fail-safe" behavior that occurs only
when the very broad limits of physical tolerance are
exceeded. When supplies are
available, humans daily consume about two dry pounds
of food as well as five pounds of
water and seven pounds of oxygen, which their blood
extracts from the 50 pounds of
atmosphere that they inhale every day. Humans can go
30 days without food, seven days
without water, but only two minutes without air. With
30 days' tolerance, humans have
plenty of time to decide how to cope with vital food
problems; with a week's waterless
tolerance, they have to think and act with some expedition;
with only one-and-a-half
minutes' oxygenless tolerance, they rarely have time
to think and cope successfully.
Because the substances that humans require the least
can be gone without for 30 days,
nature has for millions of years used humans' hunger
and the fertility potentials to force
them to learn by trial and error how most competently
to solve problems. But because the
absence for more than a minute or so of oxygen (the
substance humans use the most)
could not be tolerated, nature provided the air everywhere
around the world<SUP>&#95;&#95;</SUP>in effect,
"socialized" it.

 As long as the 30-day, seven-day, two-minute tolerances,
respectively, for
lack of food, water, and air are not exceeded, humans'
minds tend to remain in ascendance
over their brain-reflexive sensing, and people are considerate
of their fellow humans.
When the human is stressed beyond these tolerable limits,
the preconditioned-reflexing
brain function takes over from the thoughtful, loving,
orderly reasoning of mind. Then the
secondary utterly thoughtless behavior occurs.

 It is at least scientifically plausible, and possibly
even scientifically validated,
to say that not only all humans but all creatures are
designed to behave spontaneously in a
benign manner and that all creatures have toleration
limits within which they continue to
function with subconsciously spontaneous amiability,
but that many have been stressed
and distressed beyond those limits early in their lives
and consequently have developed
aggressive, belligerent, or outright mad proclivities.
This is not to say that this switch by
both creatures and humans from dominance by their primary
proclivities to dominance by
their secondary proclivities is an irreparable condition
of life on Earth. Though Humans as
yet know little about complete repair of their innate
propensities, there are promising signs
that such cures are not beyond attainment by the human
mind.
