 There are progressive degrees of synergy, called synergy-of-synergies,
which
are complexes of behavior aggregates holistically unpredicted
by the separate behaviors of
any of their subcomplex components. Any subcomplex aggregate
is only a component
aggregation of an even greater event aggregation whose
comprehensive behaviors are
never predicted by the component aggregates alone. There
is a synergetic progression in
Universe<SUP>&#95;&#95;</SUP>a hierarchy of total complex behaviors entirely
unpredicted by their successive
subcomplexes' behaviors. It is manifest that Universe
is the maximum synergy-of-
synergies, being utterly unpredicted by any of its parts.

 It is readily understandable why humans, born utterly
helpless, utterly
ignorant, have been prone to cope in an elementary way
with successive experiences or
"parts." They are so overwhelmed by the synergetic mystery
of the whole as to have
eschewed educational strategies commencing with Universe
and the identification of the
separate experiences within the cosmic totality.

 Synergetics is the exploratory strategy of starting
with the whole and the
known behavior of some of its parts and the progressive
discovery of the integral
unknowns and their progressive comprehension of the
hierarchy of generalized principles.

 Universe apparently is omnisynergetic. No single part
of experience will ever
be able to explain the behavior of the whole. The more
experience one has, the more
opportunity there is to discover the synergetic effects,
such as to be able to discern a
generalized principle, for instance. Then discovery
of a plurality of generalized principles
permits the discovery of the synergetic effects of their
complex interactions. The
synergetic metaphysical effect produced by the interaction
of the known family of
generalized principles is probably what is spoken of
as wisdom.
