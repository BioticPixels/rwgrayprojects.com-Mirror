 Critical proximity occurs where there is angular transition
from "falling back
in" at 180-degree to 90-degree orbiting<SUP>&#95;&#95;</SUP>which is precession.
(Gravity may be described
as "falling back in" at 180 degrees.) The quantity of
energy that ceased to "fall in" is the
system's entropy. Critical proximity is when it starts
either "falling in" or going into orbit,
which is the point where either entropy or antientropy
begins.

 An aggregate of "falling ins" is a body. What we call
an object or an entity is
always an aggregate of interattracted entities; it is
never a solid. And the critical proximity
transition from being an aggregate entity to being a
plurality of separate entities is
precession, which is a "peeling off" into orbit rather
than falling back in to the original
entity aggregate. This explains entropy intimately.
It also explains intimately the apparent
energy losses in chemical transformations, associations,
disassociations and high-order
element disintegration into a plurality of lower-order
elements<SUP>&#95;&#95;</SUP>and nothing is lost. Entity
has become invisible. The switch is precessional.

 The unprotected far side of the Moon has more craters
of the "fallen-in"
asteroids. Ergo, the far side weighs more than the near
side, which is shielded by the
Earth. The additional far-side weight of the Moon acts
centrifugally to keep the weighted
side always away from the Earth around which it orbits.
Ergo, there is always one side, the
same side, facing us. The Moon is always oriented toward
us, like a ship that has its masts
pointed inwardly toward us and its weighted keel away
from us. This explains why the
first photographs showed a greater number of craters
on the far side of the Moon. The
Earth acts as a shield. On Earth, the craters are not
so concentrated because the Earth gets
its cosmic fallout quite evenly. Earth's weight and
massive pull are progressively increased
to offset the Moon's farside weight increase and tendency
otherwise to forsake Earth.
