 Science has been cogently defined by others as the
attempt to set in order the
facts of experience. When science discovers order subjectively,
it is pure science. When
the order discovered by science is objectively employed,
it is called applied science. The
facts of experience are always special cases. The order
sought for and sometimes found by
science is always eternally generalized; that is, it
holds true in every special case. The
scientific generalizations are always mathematically
statable as equations with one term on
one side of the equation and a plurality of at least
two terms on the other side of the
equation.

 There are eternal generalizations that embrace a plurality
of generalizations.
The most comprehensive generalization would be that
which has <I>U = MP</I>, standing for an
eternally regenerative Universe of <I>M</I> times <I>P</I>, where
<I>M</I> stands for the metaphysical and <I>P</I>
stands for the physical. We could then have a subgeneralization
where the physical
<I>P = E<SUP>r</SUP>&middot; E<SUP>m</SUP></I>, where <I>E<SUP>r</SUP></I>
stands for energy as radiation
and <I>E<SUP>m</SUP></I> stands for energy as matter.
There are thus orders of generalization in which the
lower orders are progressively
embraced by the higher orders. There are several hundred
first-order generalizations
already discovered and equatingly formalized by scientist-artists.
There are very few of the
higher order generalizations. Because generalizations
must hold true without exception,
these generalizations must be inherently eternal. Though
special-case experiences
exemplify employment of eternal principles, those special
cases are all inherently terminal;
that is, in temporary employment of the principles.

 No generalized principles have ever been discovered
that contradict other
generalized principles. All the generalized principles
are interaccommodative. Some of
them are synchronously interaccommodative; that is,
some of them accommodate the
other by synchronized nonsimultaneity. Many of them
are interaccommodative
simultaneously. Some interact at mathematically exponential
rates of interaugmentation.
Because the physical is time, the relative endurances
of all special-case physical
experiences are proportional to the synchronous periodicity
of associability of the complex
principles involved. Metaphysical generalizations are
timeless, i.e., eternal. Because the
metaphysical is abstract, weightless, sizeless, and
eternal, metaphysical experiences have
no endurance limits and are eternally compatible with
all other metaphysical experiences.
What is a <I>metaphysical experience?</I> It is comprehending
the relationships of eternal
principles. The means of communication is physical.
That which is communicated, i.e.,
understood, is metaphysical. The symbols with which
mathematics is communicatingly
described are physical. A mathematical principle is
metaphysical and independent of
whether X,Y or A,B are symbolically employed.

 <I>Generalized design-science exploration</I> is concerned
with discovery and use
by human mind of complex aggregates of generalized principles
in specific-longevity,
special-case innovations designed to induce humanity's
consciously competent
participation in local evolutionary transformation events
invoking the conscious
comprehension by ever-increasing proportions of humanity
of the cosmically unique
functioning of humans in the generalized design scheme
of Universe. This conscious
comprehension must in turn realize ever-improving implementations
of the unique human
functioning as well as an ever-increasingly effective
concern for the relevant ecological
intercomplementation involved in local Universe support
of humanity's functioning as
subjective discoverer of local order and thereafter
as objective design-science inventor of
local Universe solutions of otherwise unsolvable problems,
design-science solutions of

 The prime eternal laws governing design science as
thus far accrued to that
of the cosmic law of generalized design-science exploration
are realizability and relative
magnitude of reproducibility, which might be called
the law of regenerative design: the
relative physical time magnitude of reproducibility
is proportional to the order of
magnitude of cosmic function generalizability. Because
the higher the order of synergetic
function generalization, the more embracing and simple
its statement; only the highest
orders can embracingly satisfy the plurality of low-order
interaccommodation conditions.

 There are several corollaries to the prime law of
regenerative design
durability and amplitude of reproducibility. <I>Corollary
A:</I> The simpler, the more enduringly
reproducible. <I>Corollary B:</I> The special-case realizations
of a given design complex
correlate as the more symmetrical, the more reproducible.
<I>Corollary C:</I> There being limit
cases of optimum symmetry and simplicity, there are
simplicities of conceptual realization.
The most enduringly reproducible design entities of
Universe are those occurring at the
min-max limits of simplicity and symmetry.

outside the system considered and all of the Universe

together with the structural pattern integrity system
separating the inside from the outside,
there being a limited minimum set of structural and
operating principles eternally
producing and reproducing recognizable pattern integrity.
And there are likewise a
minimum set of principles that interact to transform
already orderly patterns into other
structured patterns, and there being minimum constituent
patterns that involve the
complex intertransformings and structural formings of
symmetrical orders and various
magnitudes of asymmetrical deviations tolerated by the
principles complexedly involved.
There are scientifically discoverable nuclear aggregates
of primary design integrity as well
as complex symmetrical reassociabilities of the nuclear
primary integrities and deliberately
employable relationships of nuclear simplexes which
designedly impose asymmetrical-
symmetrical pulsative periodicities.

 All the fundamental nuclear simplexes of the 92 inherently
selfregenerative
physical Universe elements are a priori to human mind
formulation and invention and are
only discoverable by mind's intuitive initiatives. Many
myriads of complex associability of
chemical compounding of the nuclear simplexes can be
experimentally discovered, or,
after comprehending the order of the principles involved,
deliberately invented by human
mind. The chemical compounds are temporary and have
limited associabilities. Human
minds can then invent, by deliberate design, momentarily
appropriate complex associative
events<SUP>&#95;&#95;</SUP>as, for instance, hydraulics, crystallines, and
plasmics, in turn involving mechanics
of a complex nature and longevity. Omniautomated self
parts replacing sensingly fedback
industrial complexes can be comprehensively designed

always be fundamental to the design

 Biological designs a priori to human alteration contriving
are directly
reproducible in frequency design magnitude. Blades of
grass are reproduced on planet
Earth in vast quantities due to the universal adequacy
of Sun and other star photosynthetic
impoundment. Daisies, peanuts, glowworms, etc. are reproduced
in direct complement to
their design complexity, which involves biological and
eternal environmental interplay of
chemical element simplexes and compounds under a complex
of energy, heat, and pressure
conditions critical to the complex of chemical associating
and disassociating involved.
Humans have thus far evolved the industrial complex
designing which is only of
kindergarten magnitude compared to the complexity of
the biological success of our
planet Earth. In its complexities of design integrity,
the Universe is technology.

 The technology evolved by man is thus far amateurish
compared to the
elegance of nonhumanly contrived regeneration. Man does
not spontaneously recognize
technology other than his own, so he speaks of the rest
as something he ignorantly calls
nature. Much of man's technology is of meager endurance,
being comprised at the outset
of destructive invention such as that of weaponry, or
for something in support of the
quick-profit, man-invented game of selfishly manipulative
game-playing and rule-inventing
