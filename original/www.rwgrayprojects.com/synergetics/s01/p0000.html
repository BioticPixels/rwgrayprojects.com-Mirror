 <B>Awareness of the Child:</B> The simplest descriptions
are those expressed by
only one word. The one word alone that describes the
experience "life" is "awareness."
Awareness requires an otherness of which the observer
can be aware. The communication
of awareness is both subjective and objective, from
passive to active, from otherness to
self, from self to otherness.

 Awareness is the otherness saying to the observer,
"See Me." Awareness is
the observer saying to self, "I see the otherness."
Otherness induces awareness of self.
Awareness is always otherness inductive. The total complex
of otherness is the
environment.

 Life begins only with otherness. Life begins with
awareness of environment.
In Percival W. Bridgman's identification of Einstein's
science as <I>operational science</I>, the
comprehensive inventory of environmental conditions
is as essential to "experimental
evidence" as is the inventory of locally-focused-upon
experimental items and
interoperational events.

 The child's awareness of otherness phenomena can be
apprehended only
through its nerve-circuited sense systems and through
instrumentally augmented, macro-
micro, sense-system extensions<SUP>&#95;&#95;</SUP>such as eyeglasses. Sight
requires light, however, and
light derives only from radiation of celestial entropy,
where Sunlight is starlight and fossil
fuels and fire-producing wood logs are celestial radiation
accumulators; ergo, all the
sensings are imposed by cosmic environment eventings.

 The child apprehends only sensorially. The combined
complex of different
sensorial apprehendings (touch, smell, hear, see) of
each special case experience are
altogether coordinated in the child's brain to constitute
"awareness" conceptions. The
senses can apprehend only other-than-self "somethings"<SUP>&#95;&#95;</SUP>for
example, the child's left
hand discovering its right hand, its toe, or its mother's
finger. Brains differentially
correlate the succession of special case informations
communicated to the brain by the
plurality of senses. The brain distinguishes the new,
first-time-event, special case
experiences only by comparing them with the set of all
its recalled prior cognitions.

 Although children have the most superb imaginative
faculties, when they
explore and arrive at new objective formulations, they
rely<SUP>&#95;&#95;</SUP>spontaneously and
strategically<SUP>&#95;&#95;</SUP>only upon their own memory of relevant
experiences. With anticipatory
imagination children consider the consequences of their
experiments, such as a physical
experiment entailing pure, unprecedented risk yet affording
a reasonable possibility of
success and including a preconception of the probable
alternative physical consequences of
their attempt. For example, they may conceivably jump
over a ditch today even though it
is wider than any over which they have previously leapt.
They only make the attempt
because they have also learned experientially that,
as they grow older and bigger, they are
often surprised to find that they can jump farther and
higher than ever before. "How do all
my muscles feel about it now?" and "Shall I or shall
I not try?" become exquisitely
aesthetic questions leading to synergetically integrated,
physical-metaphysical, split-second
self-appraisals and exclusively intuitive decisions.
If it's "Everything go!" all thoughts of
negative consequences are brushed aside.

 Children conduct their spontaneous explorations and
experiments with naive
perceptivity. They have an innate urge first subjectively
to <I>sort out, find order in,
integratively comprehend,</I> and <I>synergetically memory-bank</I>
their experience harvests as
intertransformability system sets. Thereafter they eagerly
seek to demonstrate and
redemonstrate these sets as manifest of their comprehension
and mastery of the synergetic
realizability of the system's physical principles. Consequently
children are the only
rigorously pure physical scientists. They accept only
sensorially apprehensible,
experimentally redemonstrable physical evidence.

 The direct sensing of information may sometimes be
deceptive and illusory
due to such factors as coincidence, congruence, or the
time-and-angle distortions of
perspective. For instance, the parallel railroad tracks
seem (mistakenly) to converge at the
horizon, and the apparently "motionless" remote stars
seem (mistakenly) fixed, while they
are in fact speeding at celestial macrorates.

 Children can learn from their successive observations
of the rotational
progression of angles that the hour and minute hands
of a clock have moved; that the tree
and the vine have grown; and that the pond's top has
frozen into ice that surprisingly
floats<SUP>&#95;&#95;</SUP>getting colder usually means getting denser and
heavier per given volume, which
erroneously suggests that ice should sink to the pond's
bottom. But the crystallization of
water forms a "space frame" whose members do not fill
allspace. This vacated space
embraces and incorporates oxygen from the atmosphere<SUP>&#95;&#95;</SUP>which
makes ice lighter than
water. The crystallization of water takes up more room
than does the water in its liquid
nonform condition. Crystallization is structurally and
vectorially linear: it is not allspace-
filling. Crystalline structurings are interspersed by
additional atmospheric molecules
occupying more volume (ergo, having less mass); the
process of crystallization cracks
open its closed containers. If ice did not float, if
ice sank to the bottom, life would have
long since disappeared from planet Earth.

 Comprehensively concerned children can learn how to
avoid the miscarriages
of misconceptioning as induced by too-brief reviews
of their progressive experiences as
observed from too few viewpoints or loci. They can learn<SUP>&#95;&#95;</SUP>as
did Einstein<SUP>&#95;&#95;</SUP>of the
plurality of different, instrumentally measured, time-angle-and-size
aspects of the same
phenomena as viewed from different given environmental
surrounding points by different
observers at as close to the "same" time as possible,
taken at "almost the same time" as
well as at distinctly different times. The foregoing
is what led Einstein to the discovery of
relativity.

All the geometries in the cosmic hierarchy
(see <A HREF="../s09/p8220.html#982.62">Table 982.62</A>)
emerge from
the successive subdividing of the tetrahedron and its
combined parts. After the initial
halvings and inadvertent thirdings inherent in the bisecting
of the triangles as altogether
generated by all seven sets of the great circle equators
of symmetrical-systems spin
(Sec. <A HREF="../s10/p3363.html#1040.00">1040</A>),

The child starts with an enlargement of his mother's

on dacron cords. The child drapes
the necklace over his shoulders to assume various shapes.
Then, removing one tube at a

 Only the tetrahedron can accommodate the asymmetric
aberrations of
otherness without losing the integrity of its own four-dimensional
symmetry and its
subdivisible volumetric rationality. The asymmetric
aberrations of otherness are essential
to awareness, awareness being the minimum statement
of the experience life. In the
accommodation of asymmetric aberration the tetrahedron
permits conceptual focus upon
otherness, which is primitively essential to the experience
of life, for it occasions life's
initial awareness.

Suddenly one "<I>otherness</I>" ball appears. Life begins.
The two balls are mass-interattracted;
they roll around on each other. A third ball appears
and is mass-attracted; it rolls into the
valley of the first two to form a triangle in which
the three balls may involve-evolute. A
fourth ball appears and is also mass-attracted; it rolls
into the "nest" of the triangular

become a self-stabilized system: the

 The isosceles triangle, with all angles less than 90
degrees, folds into an
irregular tetrahedron consisting of four similar irregular
tetrahedra. Their total volume
equals the volume of the central irregular octahedron
(inadvertently described). (See Fig. 100.414.)

 <B>Unfoldable Limit:</B> The scalene triangle, having one
angle greater than 90
degrees, will not fold into a tetrahedron, but it consists
of 16 similar triangles. (See Fig. 100.415.)

 The triangle folded into a tetrahedron inadvertently
describes the four
exposed faces of the tetrahedron's internal octahedron.
(See Figs; 100.416A-D.)

 Dr. Frank Morley, a professor of mathematics at Johns
Hopkins University,
was the author of a theorem on triangular symmetry:
The three interior intersection points
of the trisectors of any triangle's three angles will
always describe an equiangular triangle.
It may be demonstrated graphically as in Fig. 100.51.
This theorem is akin to the
tetrahedral coordinate system of synergetics
(<A HREF="../s04/p2000.html#420.00">Sec. 420</A>),
which describes how the
superficial dissimilarities and aberrations of the tetrahedron
in no way alter any of its
constant symmetries of omnirational subdivisioning .

 This moment in the evolutionary advance and psychological
transformation
of humanity has been held back by non-physically-demonstrable<SUP>&#95;&#95;</SUP>ergo
non-
sensorial<SUP>&#95;&#95;</SUP>conceptionless mathematical devices and by
the resultant human
incomprehensibility of the findings of science. There
are two most prominent reasons for
this incomprehensibility: The first is the non-physically
demonstrable mathematical tools.
The second is our preoccupation with the sense of static,
fixed "space" as so much
unoccupied geometry imposed by square, cubic, perpendicular,
and parallel attempts at
coordination, <I>rather than</I> regarding "space" as being
merely systemic angle-and-frequency
information that is presently non-tuned-in within the
physical, sensorial range of tunability
of the electromagnetic sensing equipment with which
we personally have been organically
endowed.

 The somethingness here and the nothingness there of
statically interarrayed
"space" conceptioning is vacated as we realize that
the infratunable is subvisible high-
frequency eventing, which we speak of as <I>matter</I>, while
the ultratunable is radiation, which
we speak of as <I>space</I>. The tunable is special case, sensorially
apprehensible episoding.
