 Synergy is disclosed by the interattraction for one
another of two or more
separate objects. But any two masses will demonstrate
that halving the distance between
them will fourfold their attraction for each other.
(Which is the way Newton might have
said it, but did not.) He discovered the mathematical
gain in attraction, but he stated it
"inversely," which is awkward and nonspontaneously illuminating.
The inverseness led him
to speak in terms of progressive diminution of the attraction:
as the distance away was
multiplied by two, the attraction diminished by four;
ergo, he could speak of it as
"squared." The attraction of one mass for the other
increases as the second power of the
rate of increase of their proximity to one another:
halve the distance and the interaction is
fourfolded.

 Our senses are easily deceived because mass interattraction
is not explained
and cannot be predicted by any characteristic of any
one massive body considered alone.
Local observation of mass attraction is also obscured
by the overwhelming presence of
Earth's gravity. For instance, two 12-inch-in-diameter
spheres of so dense a material as
ivory do not appear to attract each other until they
are only about a paper-thin distance
apart. The thickness of a paper match superimposed on
a 12-inch globe represents the
point at which a rocket precesses into orbit, going
from its 180-degree tendency to fall
into its 90-degree orbital independence as an astronomical
entity. This is the critical-
behavior point at which it becomes an independent entity
in Universe, a satellite. Small
Earth satellites orbit at an altitude of only about
100 miles, which is only about 1/80th of
the diameter of the Earth. This critical proximity event
of transition from 180-degree to
90-degree independence is called precession. Mass attraction
is also involved in
precession, another member of the family of generalized
principles. But scientists still have
not the slightest idea why mass attraction occurs; they
only know that it does. They do not
know why. This requires admission of an utter a priori
mystery within which the masses
demonstrate their utterly mysterious attraction for
one another. It appears that no single
part of the Universe can predict the behavior of the
whole. As we attain greater experience
and opportunity to observe the synergetic effects of
Universe, there is always a greater
discernment of generalized principles. The discovery
of a plurality of generalized principles
permits the discovery of the synergetic effect of their
complex interactions.
