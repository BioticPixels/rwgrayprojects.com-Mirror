 If camera-equipped telescopes were mounted aboard Earth-dispatched
and -
controlled satellites that were ``locked'' in fixed-formation
flight positions around Earth,
with one such fixed satellite hovering steadily over
each vertex of a one-mile-edged world-
triangulation grid, and if each telescope was trained
so that the eyepiece of its eyepiece-to-
optics' axis would be pointed exactly toward the center
of Earth and its outer optics' end
pointed exactly toward whatever star, if any, may be
in exact zenith over the point on the
surface of Earth above which the satellite was vertically
positioned, a human on Earth at
any of those points looking vertically outward into
the heavens with a radarscope would
discover that satellite as a blip in the middle of his
scope-viewing tube's grid.

 Now let us have an around-the-world simultaneous clicking
of the shutters
of the cameras attached to each of the telescopes of
each of those around-Earth, fixedly
hovering photo-satellites with their telescopes pointed
to whatever stars may be vertically
outward from Earth at their respective omni-Earth-triangulated,
one-mile-apart, grid
vertexes. Let us assume the photographing telescopes
to be very long-barreled to shield
those not pointing at Sun from its intense luminosity.
A composite mosaic of all those
pictures could now be print-mounted spherically on the
inside of a translucent 200-foot
globe of Earth's conventional geographic data of continents,
islands, etc., together with
the conventional latitude-longitude grid. Because they
were photographed outside Earth's
cloud cover, they would present a composite and accurate
spherical picture of what the
navigators and astronauts call the <I>celestial sphere,</I>
with the relative brilliance of the stars
in evidence with astronomically calculatable corrections
being made in the printing for the
Sun's luminosity effects.

 While this picture was orientationally unique to its
one moment in eternity in
respect to the Earth-to-celestial-sphere orientation,
Earth data per se and the celestial
sphere data per se remain constant at their magnitude

any human.

 Because of the accuracy with which this spherical picture
was made, it
would also be possible to take a transparent-plastic,
20-foot globe of Earth, with the
latitude-longitude grid and the continents and islands
outlined, together with the marker
points identifying the respective positions of the satellite-mounted
telescope cameras at the
time of the photographing, and to position the 20-foot
Earth globe within the 200-foot
celestial sphere globe with the miniature Earth's spherical
center congruent with the
spherical center of the 200-foot celestial sphere.

 It is then possible to orient the miniature 20-foot-diameter
Earth globe so
that its polar axis is pointed toward the North Star,
making a small correction to
correspond with the astronomical correction for the
small aberration well known to exist
in this respect, which is negligible in this description
of the properties of our triangular
geodesics transformational projection. We may then rotate
the miniature Earth 20-foot
globe around its axis until a sighting from its exact
center will register each of the satellite
camera positions with each of the stars of the 200-foot
celestial sphere that the satellites
photographed in exact verticality outward from Earth.

 Earth's highest mountaintop is five miles above sea
level, and the ocean's
deepest bottom is five miles below sea level. We could
now modify the surface of our
transparent-plastic, 20-foot model of Earth to show
these aberrations, which indicate that
some parts of Earth's surface have a differential radial
distance from Earth's center; but it
would be in evidence that the stars would be in zenith
over the same latitude-longitude
grid points as would all of the satellite photographic
stations.

 Finding that surface aberrations include only radial-distance
variations and
changes in the spherical-surface line-of-sight projections
from the center, we will now
introduce a clear-plastic shell model of a whale and
of a crocodile, of such sizes that the
crocodile is large enough to omnisurround or swallow
the 20-foot miniature Earth globe,
and that the whale is large enough to swallow the crocodile
yet small enough to be inside
the 200-foot-diameter, clear-plastic celestial sphere.
With omnidirectional spoke-wires, we
will now tensionally position the whale within the 200-foot
celestial sphere, and we will
tensionally wire-position the crocodile within the whale,
and the 20-foot miniature Earth
within the crocodile. The miniature Earth is oriented
as before, its volumetric center
exactly in congruence with the center of volume of the
celestial sphere, with all of the stars
at the time of the photographing in register with the
same satellites that photographed
them.

 Now the whale's and the crocodile's surfaces will be
at a great variety of
different radii distances from the concentric volumetric
centers of the 200-foot and 20-
foot spheres. We are going now to coat the surfaces
of the transparent whale and
transparent crocodile with a photosensitive emulsion.
Then we have a high-intensity light
source flash at the common volumetric centers of the
20-foot and 200-foot spheres. This
process will reproduce on the plastic skin of both the
whale and the crocodile<SUP>&#95;&#95;</SUP>as well as
on the celestial 200-foot sphere<SUP>&#95;&#95;</SUP>the triangular satellite-positioning
grid together with the
latitude-longitude grid and all Earth's continental
and insular outlines. Then, traveling with
a pencil-beam strobic light on the outside of the 200-foot
celestial sphere, we will point
vertically inward against each of the stars, thus projecting
their positions radially, i.e.,
vertically, inwardly to register on the skins of both
the whale and the crocodile and on the
20-foot Earth globe. Now, with the human eye at the
common concentric centers of
volume of the 20-foot and 200-foot spheres, as well
as both the whale and the crocodile,
we may sight outwardly<SUP>&#95;&#95;</SUP>which is inherently radially<SUP>&#95;&#95;</SUP>in
all directions, and observe that
all the grids and all the geographical and celestial
star data appear as one grid, being in
exact radial register. We have all the same grids and
data on all four of the concentric
surfaces: 200-foot celestial sphere, whale, crocodile,
and 20-foot Earth globe. That
registering of all data is obviously independent of
radial distance from the common center;
ergo, the only variable in the system is the radius
to any given point within the concentric
systems.

 As we have demonstrated with geodesic domes and spheres,
what is meant
by compound curvature is "omni-intertriangulated structuring
(i.e., balanced connectors)
of concave-convex surface points." Given a unit radius
sphere and the known central angle
between any two radii of known length, then the length
of the chord running between their
outer ends may be calculated trigonometrically by running
a line from the sphere center
perpendicular to the mid-chord and solving for the right
triangle thus formed, whose
halved-chord outer edge is the side opposite its central
angle, which is half the central
angle originally given, and we know that the sine of
an angle is the side opposite. When
radius is assumed to be <I>one,</I> then the well-known sine
of one-half the original angle given
is the length of that half chord. With the chord length
calculatable for a given central
angle, it is easy to calculate the length of any line
running between the outer end of one of
the radii to a position on the other radius at a known
distance outward from the spherical
center. With this knowledge we can design struts, of
suitable structural material<SUP>&#95;&#95;</SUP>say,
aluminum tubes<SUP>&#95;&#95;</SUP>and we may triangularly interconnect
all the vertex points of the
triangular grid of the 200-foot sphere. Then we can
triangularly interstrut all the grid
points on the inside of the whale; then we can-interstrut
all the grid vertexes of the
crocodile; and finally we can intertriangularly strut
the 20-foot Earth globe.

 Now again, viewing outwardly in all directions from
the common volumetric
centers of those concentric forms, we will see nothing
changed because all the struts will
be in register with all the lines of the four separate
grids. If we now dissolve the plastic
skins from all four shells<SUP>&#95;&#95;</SUP>the 200-foot celestial sphere,
the whale, the crocodile, and the
20-foot globe<SUP>&#95;&#95;</SUP>we find that all four hold their shapes
exactly as before and, being
intertrussed (<I>intertrussed</I> and <I>intertriangulated</I> are
the same words: truss: trace: and
triangle) between vertexes of the grid, and the grid
now being omnitriangularly
interstructured, we may again sight outwardly from the
volumetric center. A photograph
of what we see will reveal only the same lines in exact
register that we saw at the time of
the original first spherical printing.

 Since the speed of light permitted astronauts to understand
and adopt the
light-year in their observational data, we have learned
of the great variation of radial
distances outwardly to the different stars. In the Big
Dipper, one star is 200 light-years
farther from Earth than the next one on the handle,
which is a distance of 200 quadrillion
miles farther away from you and me than is the other.
If we ran rods radially from the
volumetric center of our model outward perpendicularly
through each of the stars shown
on the 200-foot celestial sphere to a distance perpendicular
outwardly from the 200-footer
equal to their distance away in light-years from Earth,
with the 200-foot sphere's 100-foot
radius equaling that of the nearest star other than
Sun, and assume that the camera had
photographed only those stars visible to the naked eye,
then a few of the rods would reach
outwardly ten miles, but most of them would be much
nearer in, with one of the Big
Dipper's one mile out and another a half-mile out. It
would make a vastly varied
porcupine if we intertriangularly interconnected the
outer terminals of the lines of
interconnection, which would as yet be in exact register
with the original grid as seen from
system center.

 Now let us separate the four structures by opening
up an approximate
equator in the outer ones and rejoining the equatorial
points. With this celestial porcupine
rolled into our deepest ocean and then resting on the
bottom, its top would reach
outwardly above the ocean surface to the height of Mt.
Everest; its densest, most high-
frequency-trussed spherical core would be only 200 feet
in diameter and would occur at
ocean surface. The triangularly trussed 175-foot whale
would hold its shape and size, as
would the 60-foot crocodile and the little 20-foot miniature
Earth. Obviously, they could
not appear more differently.

 Our triangular geodesics transformation projection
would show all four of
these dissimilar systems in the flat plane in exactly
the same manner and in exact register
with that of Earth alone as shown later in the icosahedral
flat-out of the world map, but
with a number (or numbers of different styles) shown
at each grid vertex, which number
indicates the radius distance of that vertex outwardly
from the center point of the system
"Earth." Four different colors<SUP>&#95;&#95;</SUP>blue for the celestial,
black for the whale, green for the
crocodile, and brown for the 20-foot Earth globe<SUP>&#95;&#95;</SUP>would
identify the relative radius
distances outward from the congruent systems' center,
which occurs at each vertex of
these four utterly different-shaped and -sized systems<SUP>&#95;&#95;</SUP>all
on the same map. This would
provide all of the data necessary to reconstruct each
of the four systems in exactly the
same relative sizes. Every point in the four systems
remains in exact perpendicular
(zenith), whether in the spherical or planar flat-out
phase or any interim transitional phase.
This makes possible the design of an airplane or an
ocean liner all on one synergetic-
geodesic map. And the flat-out map may have its triangular
mosaic pieces rearranged in
many ways<SUP>&#95;&#95;</SUP>for instance, to center the oceans or to center
the lands. And the building of
that airplane or ocean liner, as with the geodesic dome,
will generate compound curvature,
omnifinite, tensegrity trussing far stronger and lighter
than the presently designed and built
XYZ-parallel coordinate grids and their parallel-plane
sectional designing.

 The wrapping of the 30-edged icosahedron with three
rolls of paper leaves
three pairs of opposite edges open or uncovered. To
cover those open edges, we need two
more rolls. With five wrappings, all 30 edges become
enclosed: with five wrappings, 10
faces are double-covered and 10 faces are triple-covered.
Only the triple-covered have
omnitriangular gridding by the parallel ruled lines.
Thus we see that we need a sixth
wrapping to make the omnitriangulated three-way grid.
At the fifth wrapping, the three-
way grid appears about the north and south poles with
only a two-way grid on the
equatorial triangles. The whole three-way grid six-times
rewrapping in omnitriangular
gridding at any desired frequency of subdivisioning
can thus be accomplished with only
one type of continuing, parallel-ruled strip.

 Wrapping of the octahedron with two rolls of paper
left two opposite edges
open. Two strips covered all the faces. Three strips
covered all the edges. But a fourth
strip is needed to complete the omnitriangulation of
each face of the octahedron.
(Compare the four axes of the octahedron with the eight
faces perpendicular to the center
of volume of the octahedron. We are dealing with the
axes of the mid-faces.) There are
four unique ways to wrap an octahedron from a roll.
The three-way grid for each face

 If we take a transparent sheet of paper whose width
is the altitude of the
equilateral triangles of the three universal prime structures,
both of the edges can be
stepped off with vectors of the same length. This produces
a series of opposing, regular,
uniform, equilateral triangles. The altitude of the
equilateral triangle is the width of the
transparent paper ruled with parallel lines parallel
to the edges of the roll. Along the edge
of one side of this roll, we step off increments the
same length as the basic vectors of the
triangles. We take the midpoint of the first triangle
and drop a perpendicular across to the
opposite edge of the roll. We step off increments of
the same basic vector length. But the
step-offs are staggered with the vertex of one triangle
opposite the mid-edge of the other.

 This is how the lines of the tetrahedron keep wrapping
up like a spool. That
is why in the tetrahedron the axes are all the mid-edges
of the poles. One polar pair of
opposite edges is left open because the system is <I>polarized;</I>
therefore, you need the three
wrappings<SUP>&#95;&#95;</SUP>one to cover all the faces, the second to
cover all the edges, and the third for
omnitriangulation. Three axes = three-way grid = three
vectors for every vertex.

 A single wrapping defines the octahedron even though
two faces are left
uncovered. It is polarized by the empty opposite triangles.
One-half vector lacks rigidity.
The interference of two planes is required for the spin.
But we have to deal with open
edges as well as with open faces. The figure will stand
stably because six of the 12 edges
are double-spin, with two edges coming together in dihedral
angles.

 Because one preomnitriangulated strip whose width exactly
equals the
altitude of the tetrahedron can completely spool-wrap
all four faces of the tetrahedron,
and because a tetrahedron so wrapped has an axis running
perpendicular to<SUP>&#95;&#95;</SUP>and outward
through<SUP>&#95;&#95;</SUP>the two mid-unwrapped-edges of the tetrahedron
spool, such a spool may be
endlessly wrapped, being a tetrahedron and an omnidirectionally
closed system; ergo all
the data of evoluting inwardly and outwardly in observable
Universe and its scenario of
intertransformings could be continuously rephotographed
with each cycle and could thus
be fed linearly into<SUP>&#95;&#95;</SUP>and stored in<SUP>&#95;&#95;</SUP>a computer in the
most economical manner to be
recalled and rerun, thus coping with all manner of superimpositions
and inclusions at
recorded dial distances inward and outward as a minimal-simplicity
device.

1130.11 Hypothetical model studies are schematic probability
studies . Some are
planar area models, but many deal exclusively with linear
probability. Comprehensive
reality problems are not linear; they are omnidirectional.
They deal with total system and
total Universe. That is what world society is not attending
to realistically and that's why
we are in trouble: Synergy shows that you cannot solve
comprehensive problems with
exclusively local planar or local linear models.

 Conventional critical-path conceptioning is linear
and self-under-informative.
Only orbital system feedbacks are both comprehensively
and incisively informative. Orbital
critical feedback circuits are pulsative, tidal, importing
and exporting. Critical-path
elements are not overlapping linear modules in a plane:
they are interspiralling complexes
of regenerative feedbacks or circuits.

 When we go out to the Earth-orbiting Moon and plan
to get back into the
biospheric-enshrouded Earth again, we are dealing in
60,00-miles-per-hour solar system
spiraling as the solar system while part of our galaxy
rotates around the galaxy center at
700,000 miles per hour. This, altogether with the intergalactic
motion, means we can
never come back to where we were even though we safely
reach Earth.

 People may think they are being realistically linear,
but they are actually just
increasing the radius of larger and larger spiral orbits.
Each year is a Sun-spiraling circuit.
Years are not linear. As humans complete their daily
local circuits, the Earth spins about
its axis and orbits the Sun; wherefore the critical
path of progressive accomplishment that
led to humans reaching the Moon and returning safely
to Earth involves not a linear
months-and-years progression but a complex of millions
of spirals within spirals. With
each year the multimillion-stranded rope of omniinterrelated
local circuitry feedback
closures integrates synergetically to produce a spirally
orbiting, complex, system-defining
set of Sun-Earth-Moon orbiting events, and this system
finally reaches out to embrace the
Moon as well as the Earth, all of which ever expands
humanity's local Universe
involvement. (See Sec.

 A structural system (even such a structural system
as a building) can be
thought of as a multi-great-circle-faced clock, a complex
of feedback circuitry where the
sum-total of interferences of the pushes and pulls are
everywhere synergetically and locally
regenerative. As the humans complete their daily local
circuits, the Earth spins about its
axis and concurrently orbits the Sun; wherefore the
critical spiral path of progressive
accomplishment that led to humans reaching the Moon
and returning safely to Earth
involves not a linear months-and-years progression but
a complex of millions of spirals
within spirals of an around-the-Sun-by-Earth orbiting
and an around-the-Earth-by-Moon
orbiting progression, wherein we progressively establish
one feedback circuitry system
overlapping another, and another, and so on as the year
goes around.

 The reality is always systematically spiro-orbital.
Orbit = circuit. For
instance, all terrestrial critical-path developments
inherently orbit the Sun. No path can
develop as curvature-free linearity. All paths are precessionally
modulated by remotely
operative forces that produce curvi-wavi-spiralinear
paths. Increasingly complex curvi-
wavi-spiralinear, system-embracing circuits are diffusive<SUP>&#95;&#95;</SUP>ergo,
spinoff prone; ergo,
system-mass reducing; ergo, ultimately bit-by-bit self-annihilative.
Spun-off simplexes may
come into critical interattractiveness with other diffusely
detached simplexes to form other
young complex systems, to syntropically initiate new,
mass-increasing, cosmically-local-
traveler, complex system-defining, new intercelestial
orbiting circuits.
