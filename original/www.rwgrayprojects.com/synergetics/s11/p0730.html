 <B>Persistence of Perpendicularity:</B> As the frequency of
uniform spacing of
the rods increases and as the ends are uniformly and
infinitely extended, the distance each
end must move to accomplish union is infinitely decreased.
As this union takes place and
the surface of the original triangle becomes a spherical-surface
triangle of infinitely small
dimension on an infinitely large sphere, the <I>chords</I>
between the points of intersection of
the rods' triangle's surface, and the <I>arcs</I> between the
points of intersection, approach
infinitely negligible difference. We discern that, while
at the inflection point, the rods are at
right angles to the chord-arc<SUP>&#95;&#95;</SUP>''negligible"<SUP>&#95;&#95;</SUP>mean; that
they are not at right angles to the
chord at the gathering-of-the-ends phase; and that they
are always perpendicular to the
mean-arc-chord "infinity"; and that <I>the condition of
perpendicularity is persistent</I>
throughout all the transformation phases. Perpendicularity
does not "disappear" at the
zero-inflection phase of inside-outing, or positive-to-negative
transformation.

 The above development of our transformational projection
model is that of a
flexible and two-way steel rod-bristle brush with ends
extending evenly<SUP>&#95;&#95;</SUP>infinitely<SUP>&#95;&#95;</SUP>in
opposite (double infinity) directions and infinitely
tightly packed, the bristles being
mounted in the steel triangle and its rubber-band-interlaced
membrane, which is situated at
a central position between two infinite ends and, perpendicular
thereto, in both directions.

 Because the rubber bands seek the shortest distances
between their
respective points of interaction, and because the steel
<I>arcs</I> (to which they are attached at
uniform intervals) each <I>rotate</I> uniformly (as planes
of great circles of the same series of
commonly expanding or contracting spheres) away from
the other <I>two sides</I> (of the basic
articulatable steel triangle) <I>toward</I> one of which two
(rotated away from the sides) each
rubber band leads (from its own receding position on
its awaywardly rotating arc), each
band therefore yields elastically, in axial elongation,
to permit the continued three-way
awayness rotation. Each will persist in finding the
progressive set of shortest distances
between the points of the spherical triangle's respective
perpendicular rod-penetrated
surface.

 <B>Three-Way Crossings: Zigzags:</B> Great circles represent
the shortest
distances between two points on spherical surfaces,
and the chords of the arcs between
points on spherical surfaces are the even shorter lines
of Universe between those points.
When the ends of the rods have been gathered together,
the rubber bands will be found
each to yield complexedly as an integrated resultant
of least resistance to the other two
bands crossing at each surface point of the grid. They
yield respectively each to the other
and to the outward thrusting of their rigidly constant
steel rods, perpendicularly impinging
from within upon the progressively expanding grid. The
progressively integrated set of
force resultants continuously sorts the rods into sets
of rows in the great-circle planes
connecting the uniform boundary scale subdivisions of
the flexing and outwardly rotating
steel-band arcs of the equi-side and -angle articulatable
triangle.

 How do we know empirically that this force-resultant
integration is taking
place? The stresses pair off into identical zigzags
of two-way stress in every chord, in
identical magnitude, through the six-functional phases
of the six right spherical triangles
primarily subdividing the basic equi-side and -angle
articulatable steel triangle!

 How do we know that this is true mathematically? Because
the sum-total
overall lengths of the vectors in direct opposition
are identical, and the sums of their
angles are identical!
