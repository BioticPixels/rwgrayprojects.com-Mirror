 Another model is the omnitriangulated strip tape whose
width exactly equals
the altitude of the regular tetrahedron's triangular
face. This strip's surface has been
entirely divided into a series of equilateral triangles,
each of whose edges are of the same
length as any edge of the regular tetrahedron. Employing
this wavilinear-faced tape, we
can completely and successively spool-wrap the entire
surfaces of all four faces of the
tetrahedron while also wrapping four of the tetrahedron's
six edges and exactly paralleling
the wrapping tape along the other two edges of the tetrahedron.
None of the four vertexes
are embracingly wrapped, but all of them are tangentially
wrapped.

 The tetrahedron so wrapped has a wrapping axis running
through, and
perpendicular to, the midpoints of the two unwrapped
edges of the tetrahedron spool.
Being a regular tetrahedron, this spool may be used
as a roller printing device, when its
fixes are inked, to make a continuously printed strip
of edge-to-edge equilateral triangles.
Ergo, we have a device for projecting all of the omnidirectionally
occurring and
tetrahedrally observed data onto a minimum-surface system
that is unwrappable onto a flat
ribbon printout with four-dimensional coordination.
In this method of projection the
observer's viewpoint always remains perpendicular to
the outside surface of the system, as
in the Dymaxion map projection, where any star remains
in exact perpendicular zenith to
the corresponding point on the map of the world, whether
the map is stretched in one flat
plane or whether it is the surface of complete unitary
sphericity. The same triangles are
going to come out flat and the same stars are in exact
zenith over their respective points,
as the radii remain perpendicular to the system independent
of whether the triangular area
edges are arcs or chords.

 The omnitriangulated strip is an extraordinary mathematical
transformation
in which you can graphically accommodate the omnidirectionality
of all systems in an
exactly coordinated mathematical accounting. It can
project and print out on a strip all
gravitational and radiational data, be they in the form
of stars, fishes, or anything. They are
all coordinatably print-outable onto one continuous
flat ribbon map. What we have is a
true prototype of an <I>omnidirectional typewriter.</I> It
can print out each omniembracing layer
of each frequency layer of each convergent-divergent
system. When you print out the
omnidata on such a strip, it identifies specifically
where and when each event in the
transformation occurs.

 This omnidirectional, convergent-divergent, systems-reporting
device can
print out the most-economical-interrelationships trackings
and information-coordinating
routings of all systems, because it embraces the pattern
of all 87 of the most economical
and only available great-circle railroad tracks and
no-loss-holding stations of energetic
Universe; i.e., through all the closest-sphere-packed
systems; i.e., through all the isotropic
vector matrixes. In other words, if you want to go from
here to there in Universe in the
quickest and most economical way, while stopping over
here and there for indefinite
periods at no-extra-cost hotels, you have got to go
through the 12 points of intertangency
of the 25 great circles of fundamental symmetry that
apply to all the atoms and their
association in all seven of the fundamental symmetry
subsets.

 The 31 great circles of the icosahedron always shunt
the energies into local-
holding great-circle orbits, while the vector equilibrium
opens the switching to
omniuniverse energy travel. The icosahedron is red light,
holding, no-go; whereas vector
equilibrium is green light, go. The six great circles
of the icosahedron act as holding
patterns for energies. The 25 great circles of the vector
equilibrium all go through the 12
tangential contact points bridging between the 12 atomic
spheres always closest packed
around any one spherical atom domain.

 Each of the 25 great circles of any one closest-packed
sphere can be used by
that special local sphere as an "until-ready,'' local
shunt-off, holding circuit track for any
traveling energy entity. This is permitted by the fact
that each and all of the 25 great
circles are foldable into local, bow-tie, clover-leaf,
figure-eight, ``chain-of-sausages,"
three-or-four-bladed-propeller-type patterns which,
when totally interassembled, also
provide full, uninterrupted, 360-degree, around-the-sphere
circuitry. The energy entities
can travel around locally on any one sphere's holding
tracks in these local 360-degree total
shuntings for as long as is "convenient'' to the system.

 The 25 great circles of the vector equilibrium are
the only omni-intersystem-
connecting "railroad tracks'' of energy in the Universe.
When an energy entity holding
locally on a local sphere gets a green light to get
back on the grand-omni-interspheres'
system tracks, it can do so by crossing over one of
the 12 inter-atomic-sphere bridges. As
we have seen in Sec. <A HREF="../s04/p5000.html#450.00">450</A>,
three of the vector equilibrium's
four unique sets of great
circles, whose respective numbers total 25, disclose
different rates of encounter with the
tangential "Grand Central Stations'' through which
the energy-entity travelers can
transfer to other spheres of the omni-equiradiused,
closest-packed-spherical-dynamics
domains of any one elemental atomic class. Arranged
in order of the number of encounters
with (and entries into) the sphere-to-sphere, tangential
grand-central transfer points per
each great-circle cycle, they may be accounted as follows:

 Because only 12 of 16 station transfers can be accommodated,
each sphere
has inherently eternal retention of four energy entities.
Four energy entities comprise the
minimum system-defining constellation<SUP>&#95;&#95;</SUP>i.e. the tetrahedron<SUP>&#95;&#95;</SUP>which
is exactly one energy
quantum. Thus we see that the 16 potential encounters
of the 25 great-circle sphere may
be identified as 16/4=4 energy quanta, of which only
three may be accommodated at the
exits: wherefore a fourth quantum is always retained.
No sphere or atom can be
exhausted.

 In the vector equilibrium's total of 25 great-circle
circuitings, we find at any
one moment four different sets of great-circle holding
patterns and four energy quanta per
sphere, but with exit accommodation for only three quanta.
With all these beautiful local
holding-circuit switches and stop-and-go controls we
begin to comprehend conceptually
the method by which nature can shunt, valve, hold, and
transmit all information in
Universe. This is the information-control system of
the Universe. This is the way spheres
transmit through closest-packing patterns.

 This is why transistors work; it explains why somebody
was suddenly able to
discover that a tiny piece of metal embraced an energy-quanta
valving system having
reliable regularities. Science unthinkingly spoke of
this phenomenon as "solid state
physics,'' partially because individual humans could
not see those beautiful little atoms and
electrons doing their acts on their railroad tracks
and their respective local great-circle
energy holding patterns, and partially because science
has been flying blind on instruments.
For over a century science has been maintaining stubbornly
that there was nothing to see
by looking out of the windows. They said nature does
not use models in the invisible
microcosm; she uses only abstract equations. This "nonconceptuality
viewpoint" was
fortified to the public by use of the term "solid state
physics."

 In the behaviors of the vector equilibrium's 25 great
circles we have the
basis for the design of a nuclear omnidirectional typewriter,
a programmable computer
smaller than a pinhead, which is capable of storing,
retrieving, and printing out all humanly
acquirable information. Synergetics mathematics has
the ability to convert the spherically
arranged information and project it onto flat conceptual-information-printout
arrays of
negligible distortion. The least-possible-distorted
transformational projection is
icosahedral treatment employed in the Dymaxion airocean
world map system. The
simplest frame of reference, however, is that of the
spherical tetrahedron, which
transforms into the flat, omnitriangulated-grid, strip-wrapped,
four-dimensionally-
symmetrical tetrahedron. The tetrahedron produces a
conveniently linear, four-dimensional
roller printout.

 These transformational projections afford the most
economical, least
distorted means of translating the symmetrically omnidirectional
into a flat symmetrical
projection. The prime structural system of Universe,
the tetrahedron, unwraps linearly to
print out all possible variations of angle and frequency
modulation. Here we have a
conceptualizing model that can be reliably programmed
to conceptualize atomic
structurings at humanly discernible magnitudes. This
kind of atomic-level behavior is
exactly what all the computer model specialists have
been missing<SUP>&#95;&#95;</SUP>ergo, the magnitude
of the chasm between their projective equation strategies
and synergetics' four-
dimensional conceptual integrity independent of size
and its inherent ability to deal
discretely with closest-packed atomic system proclivities
and behaviors.
