 The transformational projection is contained entirely
within a plurality of
great-circle-bounded spherical triangles (or quadrangles
or multipolygons) of constant,
uniform-edge-module (invariant, central-angle-incremented)
subdivisioning whose
constantly identical edge length permits their hinging
into flat mosaic-tile continuities. The
planar phase of the transformation permits a variety
of hinged-open, completely flat,
reorientable, unit-area, world mosaics. The transformational
projection model
demonstrates how the mosaic tiles migrate zonally. It
demonstrates how each tile
transforms cooperatively but individually, internally
from compound curvature to flat
surface without interborder-crossing deformation of
the mapping data.

 There are three spring-steel straps of equal length,
each of which is pierced
with rows of holes located at equal intervals, one from
the other, along the longitudinal
center line of the straps' flat surfaces; the first
and last holes are located inward from the
ends a distance equal to one-half the width of the steel
straps' flat surfaces.

 Steel rods of equal length are inserted an equal distance
through each of the
holes in the straps in such a manner that each rod is
perpendicular to the parallel surfaces
of the strap and therefore parallel to the other rods.
Each of the straps and their respective
rods form, in effect, a long-toothed comb, with the
comb's straight back consisting of the
steel strap.

 Assuming that the steel straps are flexible, and assuming
that each of the
rods is absolutely stiff (as when employed as a lever),
if the rods have their long lower
ends gathered toward one another, at one point the strap
will yield by curving of its flat
surface to the section of a cylinder whose axis is perpendicular
to the plane of the rods and
congruent with the rod ends. The strap is bent into
an arc of a true circle whose radius is
uniformly that of the uniform rod lengths. Each of the
rods, as a radius of the circular arc,
is perpendicular to the arc. That is, the rods are constantly
perpendicular to the strap in
either its flat condition or in any of its progressive
arcings.

 Next, one of the two ends of each of the three steel
straps is joined to an end
of one of the other two straps by means of their end
rods being removed and one of the
rods being reinserted through their mutual end holes
as one strap is superimposed on the
other with their respective end holes being brought
into register, whereafter, hollow
"stovepipe" rivets<SUP>1</SUP> of complementary inside-outside diameters
are fastened through the
end holes to provide a journal through which one of
the former end rods is now
perpendicularly inserted, thus journaled pivotally together
like a pair of scissors. The three
straps joined through their registered terminal holes
form an equilateral triangle of
overlapping and rotatably journaled ends. (See Illus.

 It will next be seen that a set of steel rods of equal
length may be inserted an
equal distance through each of the holes of each of
the straps, including the hollow
journaled holes at the ends, in such a manner that each
rod is perpendicular to the parallel
surfaces of the straps; therefore, each rod is parallel
to the others. All of the rods
perpendicularly piercing any one of the straps are in
a row, and all of their axes are
perpendicular to one common plane. The three unique
planes of the three rows of rods are
perpendicular to each of the straps whose vertical faces
form a triangular prism
intersecting one another at the central axes of their
three comer rods' common hinge
extensions. Each of the three planes is parallel to
any one rod in each of the other two
planes. (See Illus.

 Assuming that each of the rods is absolutely stiff
(as when employed as a
lever) and that the rotatable journaling in their respective
end holes is of such close
tolerance that the combined effect of these two qualities
of the model is such that any
different directions of force applied to any two different
rod ends would force the steel
straps to yield into circular arc<SUP>&#95;&#95;</SUP>then it will be clear
that the three journaled end rods
permit the three corner angles of the triangle to change
to satisfy the resulting force or
motion differential.

 If the rods in any one row in any one strap have their
ends gathered toward
one another, the strap will yield by curving its flat
surfaces to the section of a cylinder
whose axis is perpendicular to the plane of the rods.
If all the rod ends of one strap are
pulled together at one point (we refer to the one set
of ends on either side of the strap),
the strap, being equidistant along its center from that
point, will form a segment of a
circle, and each of the rods, being radii of that circle,
will remain each perpendicular to the
strap and all in a single plane perpendicular to the
strap throughout the transformation.

 Now if all the ends of all the rods on one face side
or the other of the
triangle (since released to its original flat condition
of first assembly), and if all of the three
rows in the planes perpendicular to each of the three
straps forming the triangle are
gathered in a common point, then each of the three spring-steel-strap
and rod sets will
yield in separate arcs, and the three planes of rods
perpendicular to them will each rotate
around its chordal axis formed between the two outer
rivet points of its arc, so that the
sections of the planes on the outer side of the chords
of the three arcs, forming what is
now a constant-length, equiedged (but simultaneously
changing from flat to arced
equiedged), equiangled (but simultaneously altering
corner-angled), spherical triangle, will
move toward one another, and the sections of the planes
on the inner side of the chords of
the three arcs forming the constant, equiedged (but
simultaneously changing flat-to-arc
equiedged), and equiangled (but simultaneously altering
corner-angled), spherical triangle
will rotate away from one another. The point to which
all rod ends are gathered will thus
become the center of a sphere on the surface of which
the three arcs occur, as arcs of
great circles<SUP>&#95;&#95;</SUP>for their planes pass through the center
of the same sphere. The sums of the
corner angles of the spherical triangles add to more
than the 180 degrees of the flat
triangle, as do all spherical triangles with the number
of degrees and fractions thereof that
the spherical triangle is greater than its chorded plane
triangle being called the spherical
excess, the provision of which excess is shared proportionately
in each corner of the
spherical triangle; the excess in each comer is provided
in our model by the scissorslike
angular increase permitted by the pivotal journals at
each of the three corners of the steel-
strap-edged triangle. (See Illus.

 The three arcs, therefore, constitute the edges of
a spherical equilateral
triangle, whose fixed-length steel boundaries are subdivided
by the same uniform
perimeter scale units of length as when the boundary
lines were the "straight'' edge
components of the flat triangle. Thus we are assured
by our model that the original
triangle's edge lengths and their submodular divisions
have not been altered and that the
finite closure of the triangle has not been violated
despite its transformation from planar to
spherical triangles.

 If we now release the rods from their common focus
at the center of the
sphere and the spring-steel straps return to their normal
flatness, all the rods continue in
the same perpendicularity to the steel bands throughout
the transformation and again
become parallel to one another and are grouped in three
separate and axially parallel
planes. What had been the external spherical zenith
points remain in zenith in respect to
each rod's point of penetration through the now flat
triangle's surface edge. This is an
important cartographic property<SUP>2</SUP> of the transformational
projection, which will become of
increasing importance to the future high-speed, world-surface-unified
triangulation
through aerial and electromagnetic signal mapping, as
well as to the spherical world-
around data coordination now being harvested through
the coordinately ``positioned"
communications satellites "flying" in fixed formation
with Earth. They and Moon together
with Earth co-orbit Sun at 60,000 mph.

(Footnote 2: In first contemplating the application of transformational
projection for an Earth globe, I realized that the Basic Triangle
<SUP>&#95;&#95;</SUP>120 of which are the lowest common denominator
of a sphere<SUP>&#95;&#95;</SUP>would make a beautiful map. The reason
I did not use it was because its sinuses intruded into the continents
and there was no possible arrangement to have all the triangles' vertexes
occur only in the ocean areas as in the vector equilibrium and icosahedral
projection.  The Basic LCD Icosahedral Triangle also has a spherical
excess of only two degrees per corner, and there would have been
no trouble at all to subdivide until the spherical excess for any
triangle tile grid was approximately zero.  Thus it could have been
a 120-Basic-Triangle-grid, at a much higher frequency, but the big
detriment was that the spherical trigonometry involved, at that time
long before the development of a computer, was so formidable.
So the icosahedron was adapted.)

 If the rods are pushed uniformly through the spring-steel
straps so that
increasing or decreasing common lengths of rod extend
on the side of the triangle where
the rods are gathered at a common point, then, as a
result, varying ratios of radii length in
respect to the fixed steel-strap arc length will occur.
The longer the rods, the larger will be
the sphere of which they describe a central tetrahedral
segment, and the smaller the
relative proportional size of the spherical surface
triangle bounded by the steel springs<SUP>&#95;&#95;</SUP>as
compared to the whole implicit spherical surface. Because
the spherical triangle edge
length is not variable, being inherent in the original
length of the three identical steel
springs, the same overall length can accommodate only
an ever smaller spherical surface
arc (central-angle subtension) whenever the radii are
lengthened to produce a greater
sphere.

 If the ends of the rods gathered together are sufficiently
shortened, they will
finally attain a minimum length adequate to reach the
common point. This minimum is
attained when each is the length of the radius of a
sphere relative to which the steel
spring's length coincides with the length of an arc
of 120 degrees. This condition occurs
uniquely in a spherical triangle where each of the three
vertexes equals 180 degrees and
each of the arcs equals 120 degrees, which is of course
the description of a single great
circle such as the equator.

 Constituting the <I>minima transformation</I> obtainable by
this process of
gathering of rod ends, it will be seen that the minima
is a flat circle with the rods as spokes
of its wheel. Obviously, if the spokes are further shortened,
they will not reach the hub.
Therefore, the minima is not 0<SUP>&#95;&#95;</SUP>or no sphere at all<SUP>&#95;&#95;</SUP>but
simply the smallest sphere
inherent in the original length of the steel springs.
At the minima of transformation, the
sphere is at its least radius, i.e., smallest volume.

 As the rods are lengthened again, the implied sphere's
radius<SUP>&#95;&#95;</SUP>ergo, its
volume<SUP>&#95;&#95;</SUP>grows, and, because of the nonyielding length
of the outer steel springs, the
central angles of the arc decrease, as does also the
relative size of the equilateral,
equiangular spherical triangle as, with contraction,
it approaches one of the poles of the
sphere of transformation. The axis running between the
two poles of most extreme
transformation of the spherical triangle we are considering
runs through all of its
transforming triangular centers between its<SUP>&#95;&#95;</SUP>never attained<SUP>&#95;&#95;</SUP>minimum-spherical-excess,
smallest-conceivable, local, polar triangle on the ever-enlarging
sphere, then reversing
toward its largest equatorial, three- 180-degree-corners,
hemisphere<SUP>&#95;&#95;</SUP>area phase on its
smallest sphere, with our triangle thereafter decreasing
in relative spherical surface area as
the<SUP>&#95;&#95;</SUP>never attained<SUP>&#95;&#95;</SUP>smallest triangle and the sphere
itself enlarge toward the<SUP>&#95;&#95;</SUP>also
never attained<SUP>&#95;&#95;</SUP>cosmically largest sphere. It must be
remembered that the triangle gets
smaller as it approaches one pole, the complementary
triangle around the other pole gets
correspondingly larger. It must also be recalled that
the surface areas of both the positive
and negative complementary spherical triangles together
always comprise the whole
surface of the sphere on which they co-occur. Both the
positive and negative polar-
centered triangles are themselves the outer surface
triangles of the two complementary
tetrahedra whose commonly congruent internal axis is
at the center of the same sphere
whose total volume is proportionately subdivided between
the two tetrahedra.
