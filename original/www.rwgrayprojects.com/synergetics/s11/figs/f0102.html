<TR><TD>Fig. 1101.02 The projection system of the Dymaxion Airocean
World Map divides the sphere into 20
equilateral spherical triangles, which are then flattened
to form the icosahedron (J). These 20 triangles
are each projected into a flat plane (D, E, F, G, H,
I). This method results in a map having less visible
distortion than any previously known map projection
system to date. To flatten the globe it is simply
necessary to "unfold" the icosahedron (K). The more
conventional projection systems that are widely
used include the Mercator projection (A), the conic
projection (B), and the planar projection (C). All
three of these systems give rise to considerable visual
distortion, unlike the Dymaxion projection.
