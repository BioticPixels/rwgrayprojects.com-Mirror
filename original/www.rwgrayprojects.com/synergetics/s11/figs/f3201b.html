<TR><TD>Fig. 1132.01B Composite of Vector Equilibrium and Icosahedron
Great Circle Sets: This is a black-and-
white version of color plate 32. The Basic Equilibrium
48 LCD triangle appears here shaded in the
spherical grid. In this composite spherical matrix we
see all the 25 primary vector equilibrium great
circles and two sets skewed-positive and negative of
the icosahedron 31 great circle sets. (31 ' 2 = 62.
62
+ 25 = 87. But 14 of the 87 are redundant.) Four of
the VE great circles are congruent with four of the
icosa's 10-great circle set. Three of the VE great circles
are congruent with three of the icosa's 15-great-
circle set. Thus seven positive are redundant and seven
negative are redundant. (87<SUP>&#95;&#95;</SUP>14=73.) There are
73 great circles in the composite set. (See color plate
32.) This composite shows the vector equilibrium
great circles and the icosahedron great circles in the
two alternate ways of pumping the VE jitterbug
pattern.
