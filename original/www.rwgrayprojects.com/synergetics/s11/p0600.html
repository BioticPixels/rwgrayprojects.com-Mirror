 <B>Complementary Negative Tetrahedron:</B> The rod ends can
be increased
beyond the phase that induced the 180-degree triangle,
and the vertexes of the steel-spring
surface triangle can go on to be increased beyond 180
degrees each, and thus form a
<I>negative triangle.</I> This is to say that the original
tetrahedron formed between the three
vertexes of the spherical triangle on the sphere's surface<SUP>&#95;&#95;</SUP>with
the center of the sphere as
the fourth point<SUP>&#95;&#95;</SUP>will have flattened to one plane when
the vertexes are at 180 degrees; at
that moment the tetrahedron is a hemisphere. By lengthening
the radii again and increasing
the triangle's original "interior" angles, the tetrahedron
will turn itself inside out. In effect,
what seems to be a "small," i.e., an only apparently
``plane" equilateral triangle must
always be a small equilateral spherical triangle of
a very big sphere, and it is always
complemented by the negative triangle completing the
balance of the surface of the
inherent sphere respective to the three lines and three
vertexes of the triangle.

 No triangular surface is conceivable occurring independently
of its inherent
sphere, as there is no experimentally demonstrable flat
surface plane in Universe reaching
outward laterally in all directions to infinity; although
this has been illusionarily accepted
as "obvious" by historical humanity, it is contradictory
to experience. The surface of any
system must return to itself in all directions and is
most economically successful in doing
so as an approximate true sphere that contains the most
volume with the least surface.
Nature always seeks the most economical solutions<SUP>&#95;&#95;</SUP>ergo,
the sphere is normal to all
systems experience and to all experiential, i.e., operational
consideration and formulation.
The construction of a triangle involves a surface, and
a curved surface is most economical
and experimentally satisfactory. A sphere is a closed
surface, a unitary finite surface.
Planes are never finite. Once a triangle is constructed
on the surface of a sphere<SUP>&#95;&#95;</SUP>because
a triangle is a boundary line closed upon itself<SUP>&#95;&#95;</SUP>the
finitely closed boundary lines of the
triangle automatically divide the unit surface of the
sphere into two separate surface areas.
Both are bounded by the same three great-circle arcs
and their three vertexial links: this is
the description of a triangle. Therefore, both areas
are true triangles, yet with common
edge boundaries. It is impossible to construct one triangle
alone. In fact, four triangles are
inherent to the oversimplified concept of the construction
of "one" triangle. In addition to
the two complementary convex surface triangles already
noted, there must of necessity be
two complementary concave triangles appropriate to them
and occupying the reverse, or
inside, of the spherical surface. Inasmuch as convex
and concave are opposites, one
reflectively concentrating radiant energy and the other
reflectively diffusing such incident
radiation; therefore they cannot be the same. Therefore,
a minimum of four triangles is
always induced when any one triangle is constructed,
and which one is the initiator or
inducer of the others is irrelevant. The triangle initiator
is an inadvertent but inherent
tetrahedron producer; it might be on the inside constructing
its triangle on some cosmic
sphere, or vice versa.

 It might be argued that inside and outside are the
same, but this is not so.
While there is an interminable progression of insides
within insides in Experience Universe,
there is only one outside comprehensive to all insides.
So they are not the same, and the
mathematical fact remains that four is the minimum of
realizable triangles that may be
constructed if any are constructed. But that is not
all, for it is also experimentally disclosed
that not only does the construction of one triangle
on the surface of the sphere divide the
total surface into two finite areas each of which is
bound by three edges and three
angles<SUP>&#95;&#95;</SUP>ergo, by two triangles<SUP>&#95;&#95;</SUP>but these triangles are
on the surface of a system whose
unity of volume was thereby divided into two centrally
angled tetrahedra, because the
shortest lines on sphere surfaces are great circles,
and great circles are always formed on
the surface of a sphere by planes going through the
center of the sphere, which planes of
the three-greatcircle-arc-edged triangle drawn on the
surface automatically divide the
whole sphere internally into two spherical tetrahedra,
each of which has its four
triangles<SUP>&#95;&#95;</SUP>ergo, inscribing one triangle "gets you eight,"
like it or not. And each of those
eight triangles has its inside and outside, wherefore
inscribing one triangle, which is the
minimum polygon, like "Open Sesame," inadvertently gets
you 16 triangles. And that is
not all: the sphere on which you scribed is a system
and not the whole Universe, and your
scribing a triangle on it to stake out your ``little
area on Earth" not only became 16
terrestrial triangles but also induced the remainder
of Universe outside the system and
inside the system to manifest their invisible or nonunitarily
conceptual ``minimum
inventorying'' of ``the rest of Universe other than
Earth,'' each of which micro and macro
otherness system integrity has induced an external tetrahedron
and an internal tetrahedron,
each with 16 triangles for a cosmic total of 64 (see
Sec.

the maxima of the spherical equiside and -angle triangle

 No sphere large enough for a flat surface to occur
is imaginable. This is
verified by modern physics' experimentally induced abandonment
of the Greeks' definition
of a sphere, which absolutely divided Universe into
all Universe outside and all Universe
inside the sphere, with an absolute surface closure
permitting no traffic between the two
and making inside self-perpetuating to infinity complex<SUP>&#95;&#95;</SUP>ergo,
the first locally perpetual-
motion machine, completely contradicting entropy. Since
physics has found no solids or
impervious continuums or surfaces, and has found only
finitely separate energy quanta, we
are compelled operationally to redefine the spheric
experience as an aggregate of events
approximately equidistant in a high-frequency aggregate
in almost all directions from one
only approximate event (see Sec.
 <A HREF="../s02/p2400.html#224.07">224.07</A>). Since nature
always interrelates in the most
economical manner, and since great circles are the shortest
distances between points on
spheres, and since chords are shorter distances than
arcs, then nature must interrelate the
spheric aggregated events by the chords, and chords
always emerge to converge; ergo,
converge convexly around each spheric system vertex;
ergo, the sums of the angles around
the vertexes of spheric systems never add to 360 degrees.
Spheres are high-frequency,
geodesic polyhedra (see Sec.

 Because (a) all radiation has a terminal speed, ergo
an inherent limit reach;
because (b) the minimum structural system is a tetrahedron;
because (c) the unit of energy
is the tetrahedron with its six-degrees-of-minimum-freedoms
vector edges; because (d) the
minimum radiant energy package is one photon; because
(e) the minimum polar triangle<SUP>&#95;&#95;</SUP>
and its tetrahedron's contraction<SUP>&#95;&#95;</SUP>is limited by the
maximum reach of its three interior
radii edges of its spherical tetrahedron; and because
(f) physics discovered experimentally
that the photon is the minimum radiation package; therefore
we identify the minimum
tetrahedron photon as that with radius = c, which is
the speed of light: the tetrahedron
edge of the photon becomes unit radius = frequency limit.

 The transformational projection model coupled with
the spheric experience
data prove that a finite minima and a finite maxima
do exist, because a flat is exclusively
unique to the area confined within a triangle's three
points. The <I>almost flat</I> occurs at the
inflection points between spheric systems' inside-outings
and vice versa, as has already
been seen at the sphere's minima size; and that at its
maxima, the moment of flatness goes
beyond approximate flatness as the minima phase satisfies
the four-triangle minima
momentum of transformation, thus inherently eliminating
the paradox of static equilibrium
concept of all Universe subdivided into two parts: that
inside of a sphere and that outside
of it, the first being finite and the latter infinite.
The continual transforming from inside out
to outside in, finitely, is consistent with dynamic
experience.

 <B>Inside-Outing of Spheres:</B> When our model is in its
original condition of
having its springs all flat (a dynamic approximation)
and in one plane, in which condition
all the rods are perpendicular to that plane, the rods
may be gathered to a point on the
opposite side of the spring-steel strap to that of the
first gathering, and thus we see the
original sphere turned inside out. This occurs as a
sphere of second center, which, if time
were involved, could be the progressive point of the
observer and therefore no "different"
point.

 Considering Universe at minimum unity of two, two spheres
could then seem
to be inherent in our model. The half-out-of-phaseness
of the sphere maxima and minima,
with the maxima-minima of the surface triangles, find
the second sphere's phase of
maxima in coincidence with the first's minima. As the
two overlap, the flat phase of the
degree triangles of the one sphere's minima phase is
the flat phase of the other
sphere's maxima. The maxima sphere and the minima sphere,
both inside-outing, tend to
shuttle on the same polar axis, one of whose smaller
polar triangles may become
involutional while the other becomes evolutional as
the common radii of the two polar
tetrahedra refuse convergence at the central sphere.
We have learned elsewhere (see Sec.
<A HREF="../s05/p1500.html#517.00">517</A>)
that two or more lines cannot go through the same
point at the same time; thus the
common radii of the two polar tetrahedra must twistingly
avert central convergence, thus
accomplishing central core involutional-evolutional,
outside-inside-outside, cyclically
transformative travel such as is manifest in electromagnetic
fields. All of this is implicit in
the projection model's transformational phases. There
is also disclosed here the possible
intertransformative mechanism of the interpulsating
binary stars.

 Construction: Again returning the model to the condition
of approximate
dynamic inflection at maxima-minima of the triangle<SUP>&#95;&#95;</SUP>i.e.,
to their approximately flat
phase of "one" most-obvious triangle of flat spring-steel
strips<SUP>&#95;&#95;</SUP>in which condition the
rods are all perpendicular to the surface plane of the
triangle and are parallel to one
another in three vertical planes of rod rows in respect
to the triangle's plane. At this phase,
we apply a rubber-band grid of three-way crossings.
We may consider the rubber bands of
ideal uniformity of cross section and chemical composition,
in such a manner as to stretch
them mildly in leading them across the triangle surface
between the points uniformly
spaced in rows, along the spring-steel strap's midsurface
line through each of which the
rods were perpendicularly inserted. The rubber bands
are stretched in such a manner that
each rubber band leads from a point distant from its
respective primary vertex of the
triangle to a point on the nearest adjacent edge, that
is, the edge diverging from the same
nearest vertex, this second point being double the distance
along its edge from the vertex
that the first taken point is along its first considered
edge. Assuming no catenary sag or
drift, the "ideal" rubber bands of no weight then become
the shortest distances between
the edge points so described. Every such possible connection
is established, and all the
tensed, straight rubber bands will lie in one plane
because, at the time, the springs are
flat<SUP>&#95;&#95;</SUP>and that one plane is the surface of the main spring-steel
triangle of the model.

 The rubber bands will be strung in such a way that
every point along the
steel triangle mid-edge line penetrated by the rods
shall act as an <I>origin,</I> and every second
point shall become also the recipient for such a linking
as was described above, because
each side feeds to the other sides. The "feeds" must

 <B>Transformation: Aggregation of Additional Rods:</B> More
steel rods (in
addition to those inserted perpendicularly through the
steel-band edges of the basic
triangle model) may now be inserted<SUP>&#95;&#95;</SUP>also perpendicularly<SUP>&#95;&#95;</SUP>through
a set of steel
grommets attached at (and centrally piercing through)
each of the points of the three-way
crossings of the rubber bands (internal to the big triangle
of steel) in such a manner that
the additional rods thus inserted through the points
of three-way crossings are each
perpendicular to the now flat-plane phase of the big
basic articulatable steel triangle, and
therefore perpendicular to, and coincident with, each
of the lines crossing within the big
steel triangle face. The whole aggregate of rods, both
at edges and at internal
intersections, will now be parallel to one another in
the three unique sets of parallel planes
that intersect each other at 60 degrees of convergence.
The lines of the intersecting planes
coincide with the axes of the rods; i.e., the planes
are perpendicular to the plane of the
basic steel triangle and the lines of their mutual intersections
are all perpendicular to the
basic plane and each corresponds to the axis of one
of the rods. The whole forms a pattern
of triangularly bundled, equiangular, equilateral-sectioned,
parallel-prism-shaped tube
spaces.

 Let us now gather together all the equally down-extending
lengths of rod
ends to one point. The Greeks defined a sphere as a
surface equidistant in all directions
from one point. All the points where the rods penetrate
the steel triangle edges or the
three-way-intersecting elastic rubber-band grid will
be equidistant from one common
central point to which the rod ends are gathered<SUP>&#95;&#95;</SUP>and
thus they all occur in a spherical,
triangular portion of the surface of a common sphere<SUP>&#95;&#95;</SUP>specifically,
within the lesser
surfaced of the two spherical triangles upon that sphere
described by the steel arcs.
Throughout the transformation, all the rods continue
their respective perpendicularities to
their respective interactions of the three-way crossings
of the flexible grid lines of the basic
steel triangle's inherently completable surface.

 If the frequency of uniform spacing of the perpendicularly<SUP>&#95;&#95;</SUP>and
equidistantly<SUP>&#95;&#95;</SUP>penetrating and extending rods is exquisitely
multiplied, and the uniform
intervals are thus exquisitely shortened, then when
the rod ends are gathered to a common
point opposite either end of the basic articulatable
steel-band triangle, the gathered ends
will be closer together than their previous supposedly
infinitely close parallel positioning
had permitted, and the opposite ends will be reciprocally
thinned out beyond their
previous supposedly infinite disposition. Both ends
of the rods are in finite condition<SUP>&#95;&#95;</SUP>
beyond infinite<SUP>&#95;&#95;</SUP>and the parallel phase (often thought
of as infinite) is seen to be an
<I>inflection</I> phase between two phases of the gathering
of the ends, alternately, to one or the
other of the two spherical centers. The two spherical
centers are opposite either the
inflection or flat phase of the articulating triangle
faces of the basic articulatable triangle of
our geodesics transformational projection model.
