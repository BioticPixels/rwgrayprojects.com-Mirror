 When people say of Universe, "I wonder what is outside
its outside?" they
are trying to conjure a unitary conception and are asking
for a single picture of an
infinitely transforming, nonsimultaneous scenario. Therefore,
their question is not only
unanswerable but unrealistic, and indicates that they
have not listened seriously to Einstein
and are only disclosing their ignorance of its significance
when they boastfully tell you that
the speed of light is 186,000 miles per second.

 Humans have always tried to conform their concepts
of Universe to their
own human prototype. Humans stop and start; sleep and
wake; are born, grow, decay, and
die: so humans thought the Universe must also have a
beginning and an end. Now
astrophysicists find this to be untrue. There could
never have been a primordial chaos,
simply because scientists now know that the proton and
neutron always and only coexist
in the most exquisite interorderliness. There could
never have been a time when their
integrity was not an integrity.

 Universe is a scenario. Scenario Universe is the finite
but nonunitarily
conceptual aggregate of only partially overlapping and
communicated experiences of
humanity. Uni-verse is a momentarily glimpsed, special-case,
systemic-episode takeout.
When we start synergetically with wholes, we have to
deal with the scenario within which
we discover episodes<SUP>&#95;&#95;</SUP>like the frog the snake is swallowing.

 Time is only now. Time and size are always special-case,
asymmetric
episodes of now whose systemic aberrations are referenced
to the cosmic hierarchy of
primitive and symmetrical geometries through which they
pulsate actively and passively
but at which they never stop. The rest of Scenario Universe
is shapeless: untuned-in. (See

 Universe can only be thought of competently in terms
of a great, unending,
but finite scenario whose as yet unfilled film strip
is constantly selfregenerative. All
experiences are terminated, ergo finite. An aggregate
of finites is finite. Our Universe is
finite but nonsimultaneously conceptual: a moving-picture
scenario of nonsimultaneous
and only partially overlapping events. One single picture<SUP>&#95;&#95;</SUP>one
frame<SUP>&#95;&#95;</SUP>does not tell the
story. The single-frame picture of a caterpillar does
not foretell or imply the
transformation of that creature, first, into the chrysalis
stage and, much later, into the
butterfly phase of its life. Nor does one picture of
a butterfly tell the viewer that the
butterfly can fly.

 In scenarios, you have to have a pretty long sequence
run in order to gain
any clue at all as to what is going on. You cannot learn
what it is all about from a single

 In the endless but finite and never exactly repeating
(Heisenberged) "film-
strip" scenario of evolutionary Universe, after the
film strip has been projected, it goes
through a dissolved phase and re-forms again to receive
the ever-latest self-
intertransforming patterning just before being again
projected. The rate of change and the
numbers of special-case self-retransformings of <I>physical
evolution</I> tend ever to accelerate,
differentiate, and multiply; while the rate of change
and the numbers of self-remodifyings
of generalized law conceptionings of <I>metaphysical evolution</I>
tend ever to decelerate,
simplify, consolidate, and ultimately unify.

 The speeds of all the known different phases of measured
radiation are
apparently identical despite vast differences in wavelength
and frequency. Einstein's
adoption of electromagnetic radiation expansion<SUP>&#95;&#95;</SUP>omnidirectionally
in vacuo<SUP>&#95;&#95;</SUP>as normal
speed suggests a top speed of omnidirectional entropic
disorder increase accommodation
at which radiant speed reaches highest velocity. This
highest velocity is reached when the
last of the eternally regenerative Universe cyclic frequencies
of multibillions of years have
been accommodated, all of which complex of nonsimultaneous
transforming,
multivarietied frequency synchronizations is complementarily
balanced to equate as zero
by the sum totality of locally converging, orderly,
and synchronously concentrating energy
phases of scenario Universe’s eternally pulsative, and
only sum-totally synchronous,
disintegrative, divergent, omnidirectionally exporting,

 As seen by an individual human observer or as recorded
by any humanly

reaggregated within the recorded,

 Scenario Universe is to any and all human observers
very much like a rope-
making experience<SUP>&#95;&#95;</SUP>a rope that grows ever greater in
total complexity but not in total
diameter, and is comprised of ever more exquisitely
diametered and ever stronger separate
and differently lengthed fibers, a rope of which each
of the myriad of progressive
information events are in themselves terminal.

 Each fiber enters into the scenario of rope-making
by being twisted with
others into a small thread of successively introduced
and only partially overlapping fibers.
This composited thread in turn is twisted with other
threads into more complex strands.
The strands are twisted with strands<SUP>&#95;&#95;</SUP>always consistently
clockwise or counterclockwise
(never both)<SUP>&#95;&#95;</SUP>until the totally twisted complex is brought
together with a similarly twisted
but turned-around and now oppositely directioned rope
of equal complexity, whereat,
when side by side, their respective tendencies to untwist
interwhip them together to block
one another’s untwisting and produce an overall stabilized
rope.

 Employing the concept of individual fibers in this
rope-making analogy and
substituting for the word <I>fibers</I> the word <I>photons,</I> we
can comprehend Einstein’s curved-
space assumption of the manner in which the omniremotely,
entropically dispersed,
individual energy increments, radiationally disassociated
from former star sources at
maximum remoteness from other entities, now progressively
enter the gravitational
neighborhood of radiationally disassociated energy increments<SUP>&#95;&#95;</SUP>emanated
from many
sources<SUP>&#95;&#95;</SUP>and become thereafter progressively reassociated
with one another in forming
new celestial aggregates, thereafter<SUP>&#95;&#95;</SUP>as substantive
matter<SUP>&#95;&#95;</SUP>converging to a terminal
complexity and density, thereafter once more to become
radiantly dispersed.

 The balancing of the gravitational and radiational
exchanges is again
analogous to the patterns of rope-making. We simply
splice together the ends of the
stabilized overall ropes to produce a plurality of looped-back,
cosmic rope-making in a
Scenario Universe of nonsimultaneous, local, episode
twistings and untwistings. While
some loops are unraveling, their strayed-away strands
got caught elsewhere in new
intertwinings.

 The whole analogy of the rope-making and unmaking
can be retransformed
into the cinema concept, and the words <I>fibers</I> or <I>photons</I>
being replaced by the word
atoms. We can conceive now of all the separate atoms
in the chemical compounds
comprising the photo-negative celluloid ribbon of long-ago-exposed,
financially exploited,
stored-and-forgotten footage, the significance of whose
once novel special case
information has long since been incorporated in popularly
accepted generalized
viewpoints. The old film-strip has been chemically dissolved
and its atoms disassociatively
dispersed, migrated, and subsequently reassociated in
a new inventory of on-the-shelf,
unexposed, film-strip footage upon which may be recorded
the ever-changing but
progressively increasing inventory of comprehensive
human experiences of tomorrow’s
today. In this analogy there is a plurality of fresh
individual film-strips being
nonsimultaneously and only overlappingly-in-time exposed
for each individual observer in
the Universe, as each is overlappingly intertwined into
more complex information strands.

 Synergetics always commences its considerations and
explorations with
finite but nonunitarily conceptual Scenario Universe,
which is inherently nonsimultaneous.
Scenario Universe is the totality of all humanity’s
consciously apprehended and
communicated experiences. It is inherently prohibited
for the totality of physical Universe
to be quantitatively increased<SUP>&#95;&#95;</SUP>ergo, in synergetics
we have differentiation in the family of
primitive generalized conceptual systems. Multiplication
is always and only a special case,
relative time-size phenomenon<SUP>&#95;&#95;</SUP>ergo, multiplication is
accomplished always and only as
special case frequency of subdivision of the primitive
epistemographic family of
interassociations of primitive concepts.

 All special case multiplicity is considered and expressed
in unique frequency,
angle, vector, and topological quantation terms. The
epistemography of synergetics
discovers operationally, experientially, and experimentally
that the most primitive of the
conceptual systems to be divided or isolated from nonunitarily
and nonsimultaneously
conceptual Scenario Universe must inherently consist
of the simplest minimum
considerability none of whose components can exist independently
of one another. The
system components of minimum considerability are inherently
recollectable only because
they are experientially components of observable otherness.
The words to describe
inherencies of systems were invented by humans in spontaneous
recognition of co-
occurring observabilities. The word <I>part</I> could have
been invented by humans only after
having discovered a holistically considerable system.

 Within the time frame of any one given observer <I>simultaneous</I>
means the
unitary consideration of a plurality of experientially
observable, concurrently focal
episodes with differently occurring births, deaths,
and longevities<SUP>&#95;&#95;</SUP>but they are
overlappingly co-occurring with their omnidirectionally
comprehensive environment.
Omnicircumstance conditions are often forgotten in the
recall of only the focal episodes of
the considered systems’ most prominent central memorabilities.
Con-sideration<SUP>&#95;&#95;</SUP>or the
simultaneous co-reviewing of a plurality of stars<SUP>&#95;&#95;</SUP>is
always simultaneous. But
simultaneous is not instantaneous. Apprehending and
comprehending require a time lapse.
Simultaneous is episodal in Scenario Universe. Because
our sight is only a light-wave
frequency phenomenon, <I>instantaneous</I> cannot accommodate
apprehension because
instantaneity inherently lacks time span or wavelength.
