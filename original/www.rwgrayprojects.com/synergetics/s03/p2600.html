 The support of life on our planet consists of two
kinds<SUP>&#95;&#95;</SUP>metaphysical and
physical. Both cosmic and terrestrial energetic regeneration,
organic and inorganic, are
physical; while the know-what of pure science and the
know-how of applied science are
both metaphysical. The know-what of science’s experimental
evidence informs
technology’s know-how to employ efficiently the substantive
resources and synergetic
metaphysical patterns progressively found to be operative
in Universe. These are essential
to the maintenance of life on board our planet as well
as in mounting local-Universe
exploring excursions from our mother-spaceship Earth.

 Only the physical is alterable; the metaphysical is
unalterable. All the physical
is continually intertransforming in orderly ways discoverable
only by the weightless
metaphysical mind. The local physical systems are everywhere
energy exportive, which is
humanly misinterpreted to be entropic and dissynchronously
expansive only because the
exported energies are electromagnetically (i.e., nonsubstantially)

information</I><SUP>&#95;&#95;</SUP>which is purely metaphysical<SUP>&#95;&#95;</SUP>to be always

 We look at the stars, and they look very randomly
scattered throughout the
sky. But we can say that the number of direct and unique
interrelationships between all the
stars is always (N<sup>2</SUP> - N) / 2.
This equation demonstrates the principle
of order underlying all
superficially appearing disorderliness or randomness
(see Sec. <A HREF="../s02/p2400.html#227.00">227</A>)
and tells us quite
clearly and simply that we are mathematically justified
in assuming order to be always
present despite the superficially appearing disorder.
This gives us a personal sense of the
order-discovering and -employing power of the weightless
mind and at the same time a
sense of our human anatomy's negligible magnitude in
Universe when juxtaposed to the
vast array of stars visible to the naked human eye.
The stars observable on clear
nights<SUP>&#95;&#95;</SUP>the naked-eye-visible stars<SUP>&#95;&#95;</SUP>constitute but a
meager fraction of all the stars of our
own "Milky Way" galaxy. Beyond this there is the 99.99
times greater array of the only-
telescopically-visible, 200 billion other already photographically
identified galaxies, each
consisting of an average of 100 billion stars, all coordinately
operative within a 22-billion
light-year-diameter sphere of Earth-planet-mounted instrumental
observation and
Earthians' photographic recording. This spherical-sweepout
sphere of astronomical
observation by minuscule humans on Earth describes a
sphere of 123-plus-21-zeros-miles
in diameter, all of which adds up at the present moment
to each of the four billion humans
on Earth having an exclusive personal quota of 25 billion
stars or suns operatively
available to their energetic regeneration, just awaiting
his metaphysical know-how
development, with the metaphysical assurance already
established that the Universe is
eternally regenerative. Energy crises are crises of
ignorance induced by lethal self-interest.

 This cosmic-accounting analysis discloses the omniuniversal
orderliness that
the scientist finds always to be underlying all of the
only-ignorantly-apprehended illusions
of randomness. This tells us that the seeming disorder
of physical entropy is only
superficial and explains why metaphysical thought can
always find the syntropic
orderliness that cancels out all disorderliness. Disorderliness
is nonthinking. Exclusively
energetic brain, which stores the sensorial input data
of all the special-case experiences,
cannot find the synergetic interrelationships existing
only <I>between</I> and never <I>in</I> any of the
special-case systems considered only separately, any
more than a library building in itself
can find the unique interrelationships existing between
the separate data that it houses.
Only mind<SUP>&#95;&#95;</SUP>the magnificent, weightless, metaphysical,
pattern-seeking-and-apprehending
function<SUP>&#95;&#95;</SUP>has demonstrated the capability to intuitively
apprehend and mathematically
contrive the experimental means for identifying the
significant, only-between-and-not-of,
only mathematically expressible, eternal relationships,
which altogether permit a seemingly
inexhaustible variety of cosmic interrelationship patterning,
and thereby human mind’s
capability to participate in the ceaseless complex
of orderly intertransformings in such a
manner as continually to abet the human mind’s unique
local-Universe functioning in
maintenance of the cosmic integrity of eternal regeneration.

 So long as humans progressively employ and develop
their syntropic,
energetic, metaphysical mind's capability to locally
abet cosmic integrity, just so long will
that metaphysical capability continue to operate in
this particular local Universe's
ecologically regenerative, planetary team aboard spaceship
Earth. If, however, the
entropic, energetically exploiting, antisynergetic,
exclusively partisan profit
motive<SUP>&#95;&#95;</SUP>political or financial<SUP>&#95;&#95;</SUP>continues to dominate
and rule humans by force of arms,
then the Earthian ecology team will become self-disqualifying
for further continuance as a
potentially effective local sustainer of cosmic-regeneration
integrity. This is the net of
what has now become metaphysically evidenced regarding
the potential significance of
humans aboard planet Earth. It is the nature of the
contest between brain and mind. Brain
is selfishly exclusive; mind is cosmically inclusive.
Brain now commands the physical
power to overwhelm humanity. But it is also the nature
of mind’s design science capability
to render all humanity physically successful, thus eliminating
human preoccupation with
the struggle and thereby freeing all humanity to become
metaphysically preoccupied with
fulfilling its cosmic-regeneration functioning.

 The physical Universe is an aggregate of frequencies.
The human brain’s
senses are able to tune in directly only about one-millionth
of the exclusively-mind-
discovered and now experimentally proven and usable
electromagnetic ranges of energetic
reality. To this magnificent extent has the metaphysical
brought humans into potential
mastery of the physical. But thus far their physically
most powerful political masters,
misassuming ignorantly that there is fundamental inadequacy
of life support, continue to
exploit the fear that this induces in individuals, not
for the individuals’ sake but for
concern and love for their dependents. Thus individuals
concerned for the welfare of their
dependents fearfully yield their economic-strategy mandates
to the power-wielding brains
of exclusively partisan ideologists.

 In recognizing the residual ignorance of variously
dominant Earthian power-
structure partisans of this particular cosmic-history
moment, we do not impute
malevolence or wrongdoing; we are only recognizing the
checks-and-balances mechanisms
of nonsimultaneously occurring and only partially overlapping
Scenario Universe's vast
variety of local conception-to-birth gestation rates.
These gestations are the product of the
associative energies' frequency synchronizations as
well as of the concomitant rate of local
disassociative energies, the dyings-off.

 In the regenerative integrity of the cosmic design
the locally supportive,
human mind’s understanding operative on planet Earth
has to be midwife at the birth and
experiential development of critical information inventorying;
it must also sustain the
total<SUP>&#95;&#95;</SUP>Garden of Eden<SUP>&#95;&#95;</SUP>ecological regenerativity as naturally
accomplished by intense
high-frequency information transmitted by the electromagnetics
of chemical elements of
the star Sun and receivingly translated by the Earth’s
land-borne vegetation and water-
borne algae into photosynthetic sorting, reorganizing,
and combining of the planet Earth's
inventory of carbon, hydrogen, and other chemical elements.
Some of these energies are
redistributed to the biosphere, and some reenter directly
into the integral metabolic
multiplication and proliferation by all biological organisms
of the hydrocarbon molecules
and their concomitant environmentally supportive, chemical
exchanging events. To
function successfully in gales and storms while exposing
adequate leafage to the Sun, the
dry Earthborne vegetation must send into the soil and
rocks roots that draw water from
the soil to cool themselves against dehydration by the
heat of radiation exposure as well as
to provide the vegetation with noncompressible, hydraulic
structuring as well as with
hydraulic distribution of the many eccentric, locally
concentrated energy stressings of the
vegetation's structure. Because the vegetation is rooted,
it cannot reach the other
vegetation to procreate. To solve this regenerative
problem Universe inventively designed
a vast variety of mobile creatures<SUP>&#95;&#95;</SUP>such as birds, butterflies,
worms and ants<SUP>&#95;&#95;</SUP>to
intertraffic and cross-pollinate the vast variety of
vegetation involved in the biochemical
refertilization complexities of ecology, as for instance
does the honeybee buzz-enter the
flowers to reach its honey while inadvertently cross-fertilizing
the plants. Each biological
specimen is structurally designed by the programmed
codings of DNA-RNA and is
chromosomically programmed to go directly to immediately
rewarding targets while
inadvertently, or unknowingly, producing (what are to
it) "side effects" that inadvertently
sustain the main objective of Universe, which is the
sustenance of the synergetic circuitry
of terrestrial ecology and thereby as well to sustain
the cosmic regeneration.

 Humans, like the honeybee, are born ignorant, preprogrammed
with hunger,
thirst, and respiratory drives to take in chemical elements
in crystalline, liquid, and gaseous
increments, as well as with procreativeness and parental-protectiveness
drives. With their
directly programmed drives humans inadvertently produce
(what are to them) side effects,
which results in their doing the right cosmic regenerative
tasks for all the wrong
reasons<SUP>&#95;&#95;</SUP>or without any reason at all. This preliminary
phase of preconditioned human
reflexing, while lasting millions of years, is a gestative-phase
behavior that becomes
obsolete as humans' metaphysical mind discovers the
principles of precession and
discovers<SUP>&#95;&#95;</SUP>only through vast, cumulative trial and error<SUP>&#95;&#95;</SUP>the
pattern experience of both
terrestrial and cosmic ecology; whereafter humans will
progressively recommit their
endeavors in support of the recycling and orbitally
regenerative effects, precessionally
interproduced by all independently orbiting cosmic systems.
This abrupt 90-degree
reorientation constitutes the evolutionary stage through
which humanity is now passing,
wherein humanity will progressively exchange its exclusive
preoccupation with self-
preservation for that of supporting omniinclusive, cosmic
integrity.

 The physical Universe is characterized by local-system
entropy, an ever-
increasing, locally expansive randomness, and an ever-increasing
diffusion, as all the
different and nonsimultaneous transformations and reorientations
occur. While the entropy
and disorderliness of physically exportive Universe
increase and expand, we have the
metaphysical Universe countering syntropically with
energy importing, orderly sorting,
and comprehensive contraction and storage of energy.
In the metaphysically organized,
syntropic-importing phase of cosmic-energy events we
have the human mind digesting and
sorting out all the special case experiences and generalizing
therefrom the persistent
relationships existing <I>between</I> and not <I>in</I> the special
characteristics of all the special cases.
All the eternal, weightless principles apparently governing
both the physical and
metaphysical Universe are experimentally detected and
digested into mathematical
generalizations, of which only a very few are as yet
known.

 The whole process of generalizing generalizations
forms a pyramid whose
base consists of all the special cases of direct physical
experiences. We can say, "We take
a piece of rope and tense it," when we do not in fact
have a rope in our hands. We have all
had so many rope experiences that we can generalize
our communication of the concept.
This is a first-degree generalization. The discovery
of always and only coexisting tension
and compression is a second-degree generalization. Finding
a whole family of always and
only coexisting phenomena is a third-degree generalization;
and conceiving therefrom
“relativity” is a fourth-degree generalization.

 In this pyramid of generalizations the human mind

biologicals in its development of the diminishing conceptual
Universe<SUP>&#95;&#95;</SUP>diminishing
because, being progressively reduced and refined from
a plurality of first-degree to a

to as concise a form as E = Mc<SUP>2</SUP>,
which may some day be even more economically expressed
as it is synergetically digested
into ever more comprehensive and exquisite cosmic comprehension
by metaphysically
evolving human minds. So we find the metaphysical not
only comprehending the
physical<SUP>&#95;&#95;</SUP>which should have been expected<SUP>&#95;&#95;</SUP>but also encompassing
and omniaccounting
all the physical with the tetrahedron and thereafter
reducing Universe’s structural system

united, great-circle
chord vectors of the vector equilibrium, masteringly
coheres the physical by more effective
use of the same quanta of energy.

 Comprehensive Universe combines both the metaphysical
Universe and the
physical Universe. The local physical system is the
one we experience sensorially: the
conceptual metaphysical system is one we never experience
physically but only consider in
thought. As we discover in our grand synergetic strategy,
we commence all problem-
solving most advantageously at the supreme, terminally
comprehensive level of
Universe<SUP>&#95;&#95;</SUP>that is, at the generalized-principle level.
Thereafter we separate out from
nonunitarily conceptual Scenario Universe one single,
thinkable, experientially definable,
holistic concept, which definition function inadvertently
discloses the inherent polyhedral
geometry of all conceptually sizeless thought referencing.
We go on to find out through
topological mathematics how to demonstrate that the
difference between the cosmically
total metaphysical and physical Universe and any one
experiential physical system, or any
one conceptually thinkable system, is just one (positive
and negative) tetrahedron, or one
unity-of-twoness. This is to say that the difference
between the finite (because an
aggregate of finites) but nonunitarily conceptual total
Scenario Universe (which we used
to call infinity) and the physical Scenario Universe
of energy with which physics deals, is
just one finitely positive and one complementary, finitely
negative tetrahedron. The
exclusively conceptual metaphysical Universe is also
proven to be a finite scenario because
it too is an aggregate of locally terminal<SUP>&#95;&#95;</SUP>ergo, finite<SUP>&#95;&#95;</SUP>intellectual
conceptioning
experiences. The total Universe is just one (plus and
minus) tetrahedron more than either
the exclusively physical or exclusively metaphysical
conceptualized Universe. (See Sec .

 <B> Metaphysical and Physical: Summary</B>
<TABLE BORDER=0 CELLSPACING=10>
<TR VALIGN="top"><TD>Metaphysical cogitates reliably in respect to equilibrium.   </TD>
    <TD>Physical abhors equilibrium.  </TD>

<TR VALIGN="top"><TD>That which is communicated, i.e.,
        understood, is metaphysical.  </TD>
    <TD>The means of communication is
        physical. </TD>
<TR VALIGN="top"><TD>Metaphysical is unlimited and
        generalizable independent of time-space-sizing.</TD>
    <TD>Physical is limited, experienceable, and
        is always special case time space- sized.</TD>
<TR VALIGN="top"><TD>Metaphysical is unweighable,
        imponderable, and cannot move an
        electromagnetically or mass-at-tracted,
        levered needle.</TD>
    <TD>Physical is always apprehensible by an
        instrument's needle leverage actuated
        by weight, pressure, heat, or
        electromagnetics.  </TD>
<TR VALIGN="top"><TD>Metaphysical discoveries clarify ever
        more comprehensively, inclusively,
        and are more economically
        communicable in their progressive
        description of the eternally changeless,
        and the rate of the more economic
        restatability continually
        accelerates. </TD>
    <TD>Physical events are ever transforming
        and ever more acceleratingly entropic. </TD>
<TR VALIGN="top"><TD>Humans are metaphysical. You and I
        are awareness, which is the identity of
        the weightless life.</TD>
    <TD>The physical, automatedly rebuilding,
        information-gathering device we
        sensorially apprehend as our anatomy,
        employed by metaphysical mind,
        consists entirely of inanimate atoms
        and is therefore entirely physical.
<TR VALIGN="top"><TD>Conceptioning is metaphysical.</TD>
    <TD>Sensing is physical, and the sensed is
        physical and always inherently special
        case.</TD>
<TR VALIGN="top"><TD>Waves are metaphysical pattern integrities. </TD>
    <TD>Metaphysical pattern integrity waves
        articulate as physical phenomena such
        as water, air, or electromagnetic fields,
        and thus communicate their
        nonsensorially apprehensible presence
        through the displacement of the
        sensibly detectable physical
        phenomena. </TD>
<TR VALIGN="top"><TD>Symmetry is metaphysical.</TD>
    <TD>Asymmetry is physical. </TD>
<TR VALIGN="top"><TD>Equilibrium is metaphysical.</TD>
    <TD>Disequilibrium is physical. </TD>
<TR VALIGN="top"><TD>Conceptuality is metaphysical and
        weightless. Reality is metaphysically
        conceptualized information
        transmitted only through physical
        senses. </TD>
    <TD>Realizations are special case physical,
        brain-sensed phenomena. </TD>
<TR VALIGN="top"><TD>The metaphysical evolution of human
        awareness slows as it approaches the
        omniintegrated verity <SUP>&#95;&#95;</SUP> physically
        unattainable by the only-physically-
        sensing, anatomical machine designed
        specifically only for limited operation
        with the highly specialized local
        Universe conditions of the Earthian
        biosphere. </TD>
    <TD>Physical systems alone accelerate as
        they unravel entropically, ever
        approaching the speed of a noninterfered
        with electromagnetic, spherically
        expansive wave (186,000 mps.)<SUP>2</SUP></TD>
<TR VALIGN="top"><TD>The generalized conceptions of
        metaphysical evolution tend ever to
        decelerate, simplify, consolidate and
        ultimately unify. </TD>
    <TD>The special case transformings of
        physical evolution tend ever to accelerate,
        differentiate, and multiply. </TD>
<TR VALIGN="top"><TD>Generalization is metaphysical: mind
        function. Design is generalized
        metaphysical conceptioning. </TD>
    <TD>Tools, artifacts, and all humanly
        contrived extracorporeal facilities
        designed by mind are always special-case,
        brain-processed, physically
        sensible phenomena. </TD>
<TR VALIGN="top"><TD>Theoretical and applied science is
        conceptually metaphysical. </TD>
    <TD>Applied science always results in
        special-case, brain-sensible, limited-
        longevity phenomena. </TD>
<TR VALIGN="top"><TD>Metaphysically operative mind cannot
        design a generalized tool of
        unlimited and eternal capability, which
        unlimited and eternal capability is
        manifest only in purely metaphysical,
        weightless principles. Principles have
        no beginning-ending or other temporal
        limitations. Principles are truths </TD>
    <TD>We can invent only physical. The
        human mind, translating the general
        ized principles only through special
        case, individual, brain-operated
        anatomical tools, can realize only
        phenomena of special case, limited
        capacity capability and durability. </TD>
