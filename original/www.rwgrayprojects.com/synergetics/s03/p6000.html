 Universe itself is simultaneously unthinkable. You
cannot think about the
Universe sum-totally except as a scenario. Therefore,
for further examination and
comprehension, you need a thinkable set, or first subdivision
of Universe, into systems.

 Our original definition of Universe is a finite but
nonsimultaneously
occurring aggregate of all human experiences, which
is, therefore, a nonconceptual total
Universe. It is logical to proceed from this definition
to discover the patterning
characteristics of the first conceptual subdivision
of Universe into a structural system.
After we subdivide Universe into systems, we will make
further reductions into basic event
experiences and to quantum units. We will then come
to the realization that all structuring
can be identified in terms of tetrahedra and of topology.

 The Principle of Synergetic Advantage requires at
we proceed from macro
to micro. Definition requires conceptuality. Conceptuality
requires the generalization of
patterns gleaned from special-case experiences. Systems
are geometrically definable. Self-
stabilizing systems are structures. Conceptuality defines
the basic event experiences and
quantum unit measurement, which altogether constitute
structure.
The complex of event sequences is most often characterized
by overlappings. A man is born, grows up,
has children and grandchildren. His life overlaps that
of his grandfather and father and that of his
children and grandchildren. But his grandfather’s life
did not overlap his children’s nor his
grandchildren’s lives. Hence, partially overlapping.
Apparently, man matches the Universe in displaying the
same relative abundance of the 92 self-
regenerative chemical elements.
Whether communication is by telephone hook-up or by
wireless radio, what you and I transmit is only
weightless metaphysical information. Metaphysical, information
appreciative, you and I are not the
telephones nor the wired or wireless means of the metaphysical
information transmitting.
