 In the most comprehensive picture of Universe, we
find physical Universe
consisting entirely of energy. As the Second Law of
Thermodynamics shows, every local
physical system continually loses energy to surrounding
systems in physical Universe.
This loss of energy is called entropy. Because all the
local systems of Universe are in
constant motion and transformation, the energies are
given off nonsimultaneously in
multidirections and with increasing diffusion. The scientists
call this the law of the increase
of the random element. The increasing random element
brings about physical Universe
enlargement. These nonsimultaneous enlargements bring
about <I>expanding physical
Universe.</I> The expansion is verified by the astronomers’
discovery of the red shifts in
remote galaxies.

 Entropy is the measurement of disorder within a closed
system. Entropy
measures the lack of information about a structure in
a system. In Eddington’s proof of
irreversibility, he dumps a box of wooden matches on
the table. Each one splinters the
others a little; therefore, there are little hairs and
fibers sticking out. They could never be
put back in the box the same way without pressing, that
is, without investing more energy.
This is how the law of the increase of the random element
operates. The cycle keeps on
time and again, from dust to atoms to proton to neutron.
This is what nature is doing in
high- and low-pressure pulsations.... And then, after
maximum dispersal, comes
reassociation, because Universe is regenerative. One
hundred million years later they will
all be back in the box again. After the last <I>Wow!</I>

 While energy leaves one local system after another,
it does so only by joining
other local systems. The energy is always 100 percent
accountable. The energies are given
off in an ever-increasing diffusion as all the different
and nonsimultaneous transformations
and reorientations occur. The energies given off alter
the environment irreversibly. The
biologicals take on and give off more energy than the
nonbiologicals

 Universe expands through progressively differentiating
out and multiplying
discrete considerations.

 All the differences between de-finite conceptual systems
and finite, yet
nonconceptual total Universe seem to provide a fundamental
means of identifying the
physical phenomenon entropy. Entropy no longer means
inherent -escape of energy from
any local system, or decrease of local order, or increase
to disorder. Entropy now means
the invisible extraction from any local definitive system
of the negative conceptual entity;
i.e., one negative tetrahedron deposited into Universe.
balance of energy conservation,
permitting the local extraction of any visible, orderly
conceptual system. Entropy is not
random: it is always one negative tetrahedron. It can
account finitely for any discrete rate
of energy loss.
