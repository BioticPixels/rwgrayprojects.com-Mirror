 The physical Universe is a machine. In fact, Universe
is the minimum and
only perpetual motion machine. Universe is the minimum
as well as the maximum closed
system of omni-interacting, precessionally transforming,
complementary transactions of
synergetic regeneration.

 Universe is finite. Local systems are de-finite. Local
perpetual motion
machines are impossible since Universe is the minimum
regenerative set of perpetually
intercomplementary, transformative functioning.

 There is a minimum set of patterns, which is a consequence
of one set of
patterns reacting with another set of patterns. In order
to have a monkey wrench, you
also have to make one or buy one at a store, you have
to have other things, and these
procurements in turn have antecedent event requirements.
Each event of Universe leads
back to all the great complex of events, and we get
then to a minimum set of
complementary events whereby the system regenerates
itself, and we thus come to
Universe. This tends to be a clearly defined inventory
of relative abundance of the various
chemical element patterns in Universe which needs a
large amount of the pattern hydrogen
while apparently not as much of the pattern uranium.

 The significance of Einstein’s electromagnetic radiation’s
top speed
unfettered in vacuo is that there is a cosmic limit
accommodation point of complete
regeneration by which our Universe is the only and minimum
perpetually self-regenerative
system. It is a self-regenerative Universe of fantastic
complexities and design of great
integrity in which the sum total of running through
the total film takes hundreds of billions
of years before it accomplishes its remotest re-wow.
