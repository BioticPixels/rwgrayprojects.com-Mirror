<BR> Historically long perspective
<BR>Suggests it as possible
<BR>That many of the intriguing
<BR>Yet ineffable experiences
<BR>Which humanity thus far
<BR>Has been unable to explain,
<BR>And, therefore, treats with only superstitiously,
<BR>May embrace phenomena
<BR>Which in due course
<BR>Could turn out to be complexes
<BR>Of physically demonstrable realities
<BR>Which might even manifest
<BR>Generalized principles of Universe.
<BR>
<BR>For this and similar reasons
<BR>I have paid a lot of attention
<BR>To ancient <I>numerology,</I>
<BR>Thinking that it might contain
<BR>Important bases for further understanding
<BR>Of the properties of mathematics
<BR>And of the intertransformative
<BR>Structurings and destructurings
<BR>Of the cosmic scenario yclept
<BR>"Eternally self-regenerative Universe."
<BR>
<BR>My intuition does not find it illogical
<BR>That humanity has developed and retained
<A NAME="728"></A>
<BR>The demisciences of
<BR><I>Astrology</I> and <I>numerology</I><SUP>&#95;&#95;</SUP>
<BR><I>Demi</I> because they are
<BR>Only partially fortified by experimental proofs<SUP>&#95;&#95;</SUP>
<BR>Which nonetheless challenge us tantalizingly
<BR>To further explorations
<BR>Within which it may be discovered
<BR>That generalized scientific laws
<BR>Are, indeed, eternally operative.
<BR>
<BR>Our observational awareness
<BR>And Newton's proof
<BR>Of the mass-attraction law
<BR>Governing the Moon's powerful tidal pull
<BR>On the Earth's oceans,
<BR>In coincidence with our awareness
<BR>Of the Moon phase periodicities
<BR>Of female humans' menstrual tides,
<BR>Gave the Moon's (men's month's) name
<BR>To that human blood flow.
<BR>Conceivably there could be
<BR>Many other effects of celestial bodies
<BR>Upon terrestrially dwelling human lives.
<BR>
<BR>In the late 1930s,
<BR>When I was science and technology consultant
<BR>On its editorial staff, with Russell Davenport
<BR>Then managing editor, of <I>Fortune</I> magazine,
<BR>I found him to be deeply involved with <I>astrology.</I>
<BR>Russell couldn't understand why I was not actively excited
<BR>By the demiscience<SUP>&#95;&#95;</SUP>astrology,
<BR>Since the prime celestial data derived
<BR>From scientific observations.
<BR>I was not excited
<BR>Because I had no experience data
<BR>That taught me incisively
<BR>Of any unfailingly predictable influence
<BR>Upon myself or other Earthians
<BR>Which unerringly corresponded
<BR>With the varying positions of the solar planets
<BR>At the time of the respective human births.
<A NAME="729"></A>
<BR>While the planetary interpositionings
<BR>At any given time had been scientifically established,
<BR>I had no scientifically cogent means for exploring
<BR>Their effect upon terrestrial inhabitants.
<BR>
<BR>On the other hand, I found many cogent clues
<BR>For exploring the ancient demiscience of numerology.
<BR>Ancient numerologists developed
<BR>Many tantalizingly logical theories,
<BR>Some of which were
<BR>Partially acceptable to formal mathematics,
<BR>Such as enumeration by "congruence in modulo eight,"
<BR>Or, "congruence in modulo ten,"
<BR>Or in increments of twelve.
<BR>
<BR>"Congruence in modulo ten" seemed
<BR>Obviously induced by
<BR>The convenience of the human's ten fingers
<BR>As memory-augmenting,
<BR>Sequentially bendable,
<BR>Counting devices of serial experiences.
<BR>Their common appendages of ten fingers each
<BR>Provided humans with "natural" and familiar sets
<BR>Of experience aggregates
<BR>To match with other newly experienced aggregates
<BR>As congruent sets.
<BR>
<BR>There was also the popular enumeration system
<BR>Based on modulo twelve.
<BR>Human counting systems of twelve were adopted
<BR>Because the decimal system
<BR>Does not rationally embrace
<BR>The prime number three.
<BR>Since humanity had so many threefold experiences,
<BR>Such as that of the triangle's stability,
<BR>Or that of the father-mother-child relationships,
<BR>Humanity needed an accounting system
<BR>That could be evenly and alternatively subdivided
<BR>In increments either
<BR>Of one, or two, or three.
<BR>Ergo, "congruence in modulo twelve"
<BR>Was spontaneously invented.
<BR>
<A NAME="730"></A>
<BR>"Invention" means
<BR>To bring into novel special-case use
<BR>An eternal and universal principle
<BR>Which scientific experiment and comprehension
<BR>May attest to be generalized principles.
<BR>
<BR>"Etymology" means
<BR>The scientific study of words and their origin.
<BR>Through etymology man gave names
<BR>To their abstract number set concepts.
<BR>
<BR>English is a crossbred
<BR>Worldian language.
<BR>It is interwoven with Anglo-Saxon,
<BR>Old German, Sanskrit, Latin and Greek roots
<BR>Interspersed with Polynesian, Magyar, Tatar, et al.
<BR>The largest proportion of English words
<BR>Are derived from India's Sanskrit,
<BR>Which itself embraces hundreds
<BR>Of lesser known root languages.
<BR>
<BR>There are a few words whose origins
<BR>Have thus far defied scientific identification.
<BR>There are not many unidentified root words.
<BR>Those of unknown origins
<BR>Are classified etymologically as "Old Words."
<BR>All but one of the world-around
<BR>Words or "names" for numbers
<BR>Are classified etymologically as "Old Words."
<BR>The one exception is the name for "five,"
<BR>Whose conceptual derivation comes directly or indirectly
<BR>From word roots identifying the human "hand."
<BR>None of the other names for numbers
<BR>In any of the human languages
<BR>Have pragmatic identifiability
<BR>With names for any other known
<BR>Physical-experience concepts.
<BR>
<BR>To accommodate the cerebrations
<BR>Of those who are reflexively conditioned
<BR>To recount their experiences
<A NAME="731"></A>
<BR>In twelvefold aggregates<SUP>&#95;&#95;</SUP>
<BR>That is, "congruence in modulo twelve"<SUP>&#95;&#95;</SUP>
<BR>Unique names were etymologically evolved
<BR>For the numbers <I>eleven</I> and <I>twelve</I>
<BR>As well as for the numbers <I>one</I> through <I>ten.</I>
<BR>In the new world-around-accepted computational system
<BR>Of "congruence in modulo ten"<SUP>&#95;&#95;</SUP>
<BR>That is, the <I>decimal</I> system<SUP>&#95;&#95;</SUP>
<BR>The numbers zero through ten
<BR>Are called "cardinal" numbers.
<BR>
<BR>But the English names "eleven" and "twelve,"
<BR>Or French names "onze" and "douze,"
<BR>Or the Germans' "elf" and "zwoelf,"
<BR>Likewise are cardinal numbers
<BR>In the duodecimal system,
<BR>And their cardinal names are used
<BR>Even when employed in the decimal system.
<BR>
<BR>Following twelve in the duodecimal system
<BR>The number names are no longer <I>cardinal.</I>
<BR>They are called <I>ordinal</I> numbers, which are produced
<BR>By combining one, two, or three with ten:
<BR>Thir-teen, four-teen, fif-teen, etcetera,
<BR>Which are three-ten and four-ten, alliterated
<BR>In English, French, and German.
<BR>It is not until thirteen is reached
<BR>That the process of counting ordinally (three plus ten)
<BR>Is employed in the ordinal naming of numbers
<BR>Where numbers are communicable by sound.
<BR>
<BR>There are, however, number systems
<BR>Based on other pragmatic considerations.
<BR>Roman numerals constituted
<BR>An exclusively visual method
<BR>Of tactilely scoring or scratching
<BR>Of a one-by-one exclusively "visual" experience.
<BR>When nonliterates were assigned
<BR>To counting items such as sheep,
<BR>They made one tactile scratch
<BR>For one visually experienced sheep,
<BR>And a second tactile scratch
<BR>As another sheep passed visually,
<BR>And another scratch
<BR>As the next sheep passed.
<BR>The scratch was not a number,
<BR>It was only a tactile reaction
<BR>To visual experience.
<BR>It was a one-by-one,
<BR>Tooth-by-tooth intergearing
<BR>Of two prime
<BR>Sensorially apprehending systems<SUP>&#95;&#95;</SUP>
<BR>Those of touch and sight.
<BR>
<BR>While literate you, in retrospect, could say
<BR>That you see <I>three</I> scratches,
<BR>That is reflexively occasioned
<BR>Because you have learned to see groups
<BR>And because you have
<BR>A sound word for a set of three;
<BR>But nonliterate Roman servants who were scoring
<BR>Did not have to have number words
<BR>To match with tactile one-by-one scratching
<BR>Their one-by-one visually experienced,
<BR>One-by-one passing-by sheep.
<BR>The man doing the scratching
<BR>Did not have to have
<BR>Any verbal number words or set concepts.
<BR>Those landlords, priests, bankers,
<BR>Or unsolicited "protection" furnishers
<BR>Who were interested
<BR>In trading, taxing, or extracting
<BR>Life-sustaining wealth<SUP>&#95;&#95;</SUP>
<BR>As sheep or wheat productivity<SUP>&#95;&#95;</SUP>
<BR>Alone were concerned
<BR>With the specific total numbers of scratches
<BR>And of the total sheep or bags of grain
<BR>The ignorant servants had scratchingly matched.
<BR>From these total numbers
<BR>They calculated how many sheep or bags
<BR>They could extract for their taxes
<BR>Or landlord's tithe,
<A NAME="733"></A>
<BR>Or protectionist's fee,
<BR>Or banker's "interest"
<BR>Without totally discouraging
<BR>The sheepherders' or farmers' efforts.
<BR>
<BR>"Pays" means land.
<BR>The shepherds and farmers
<BR>Were known as pagans
<BR>Or paysants, peasants,
<BR>I.e., land-working illiterates.
<BR>
<BR>Because the first millennium A.D.
<BR>Roman Empire dominating Mediterranean world
<BR>Was so pragmatically mastered
<BR>By landlords and their calculating priests,
<BR>It is in evidence
<BR>That the Roman numerals constituted only
<BR>A one-by-one scoring system
<BR>In which the V for five and X for ten
<BR>Were tactilely "sophisticated" supervisor's
<BR><I>Tallying</I> or <I>totaling</I> check marks
<BR>Which graphically illustrated
<BR>Their thumb's angular jutting out
<BR>From the four parallel packed fingers
<BR>Or digits of the totaler's free hand.
<BR>On the other hand, the intellectually conceived Arabic
<BR>numerals
<BR>Were graphic symbols
<BR>For the named sets
<BR>Of spontaneously perceived number aggregates.
<BR>The Arabic numerals
<BR>Did not come into use in the Mediterranean world
<BR>Until 700 A.D.
<BR>This was a thousand years after the Greeks had developed
<BR>Their intellectually conceived <I>geometry.</I>
<BR>
<BR>The 700 A.D. introduction of Arabic numerals
<BR>Into the knowledge-monopolized economic transactions
<BR>Of the ignorance-enweakening Roman Empire
<BR>And Mediterranean European world in general
<BR>Occurred under the so-called "practical" assumption
<BR>That the Arabic numerals were only
<BR>Economical "shorthand" symbols
<BR>For the Roman scratches.
<BR>To the nonliterate ninety-nine percent of society,
<BR>It was obviously much easier to make a "3" squiggle
<BR>Than to make three separate vertical scratch strokes.
<BR>But to the illiterate the symbols
<BR>Did not conjure forth a number name.
<BR>
<A NAME="734"></A>
<BR>The earliest calculating machine
<BR>Is the Chinese-invented abacus.
<BR>It is an oblong wooden frame
<BR>Which is subdivided
<BR>Into a large rectilinear bottom
<BR>And small top rectilinear areas
<BR>By a horizontal wooden bar
<BR>Running parallel to the top of the frame.
<BR>The frame's interior space is further subdivided
<BR>By a dozen or more
<BR>Perpendicularly strung parallel wires
<BR>Or thin bamboo rods.
<BR>There are four beads
<BR>Strung loosely into each of the wires
<BR>Below the horizontal crossbar,
<BR>And one bead strung loosely
<BR>Above the bar on each wire.
<BR>Start use of the abacus
<BR>With all the beads at bottom
<BR>Of their compartments.
<BR>In this all-lowered condition,
<BR>The columns are all "empty."
<BR>To put the number one
<BR>Into the first column on the right,
<BR>The topmost of the bottom four beads
<BR>Is elevated to the horizontal mid-bar.
<BR>To put the number two,
<BR>Two bottom beads are elevated to this bar.
<BR>To put five into the first column,
<BR>Lower all four bottom beads
<BR>And elevate the top bead.
<BR>To enter nine, leave the top bead elevated
<BR>And push up four beads
<BR>In the bottom section
<BR>On the first right-hand wire.
<BR>To enter ten,
<BR>Lower all beads in the right-hand column
<BR>Both above and below the crossbar;
<BR>Now elevate one bead In the bottom section
<BR>Of the second column from the right.
<BR>The first two right-hand columns read
<BR>One and zero, respectively,
<BR>Which spells out "ten."
<BR>The totaling bead
<BR>With a value of five In the separate compartment
<BR>At the head of each column
<BR>Permitted the release to <I>inactive</I> positioning
<BR>At the bottom of their wires
<BR>Of the one-by-one elevated bead aggregates.
<BR>Lowering of all beads
<BR>Permitted "empty columns" to occur.
<BR>Moving of the tenness leftward
<BR>Permitted progressive positioning,
<BR>Which integrated or differentiated out
<BR>As multiplication or division.
<BR>
<BR>To those familiar with its use,
<BR>The tactile-visual patterns
<BR>Of the bead positions of the abacus
<BR>Could be mentally re-envisioned, or recalled
<BR>And held as afterimage sets
<BR>In the <I>image</I>-ination,
<BR>Which could be mentally manipulated
<BR>As columns of so many beads
<BR>Which read out progressively
<BR>As successively adjacent columns
<BR>Of so many beads,
<BR>Which, when reaching fiveness,
<BR>Called for moving "up" the one bead
<BR>Of the totaling head-compartment set,
<BR>While releasing the previously aggregated
<BR>Lower four beads
<A NAME="736"></A>
<BR>To drop into their empty-column condition.
<BR>When an additional four beads
<BR>Were pushed upwardly in the column,
<BR>An additional fiveness accrued.
<BR>All the beads in the column were lowered,
<BR>And one was entered
<BR>On the bottom compartment
<BR>Of the next leftward column,
<BR>As the two columns now read as "ten."
<BR>It was easier to enter
<BR>Many columned numbers in the abacus
<BR>And to add to them
<BR>Multicolumned numbers.
<BR>This process then permitted
<BR>Multiplication and division as well.
<BR>
<BR>When an abacus was lost overboard or in the sands,
<BR>The overseas or over-desert navigator
<BR>Could sketch a picture
<BR>Of the abacus in the sand
<BR>Or on a piece of wood
<BR>With its easily remembered columns.
<BR>These abacus picturers invented
<BR>The "arabic" or abacus numerals
<BR>To represent the content
<BR>Of the successive columnar content of beads.
<BR>Obviously this abacus column imagining
<BR>Called also for a symbol
<BR>To represent an empty column,
<BR>And that symbol became the cyphra<SUP>&#95;&#95;</SUP>
<BR>Or in England, cypher,
<BR>Or in American, cipher,
<BR>Or what we symbolize as 0,
<BR>And much later renamed "zero"
<BR>To eliminate the ambiguity
<BR>Between the identity of the word cypher
<BR>With the word for secret codes
<BR>And the word for the empty number,
<BR>All of which mathematical abacus elaboration
<BR>Became known scoffingly as "abracadabra"
<BR>To the 99 percent nonliterate world society,
<BR>And to the temporal power leaders
<BR>Who feared its portent
<BR>As an insidious disrupter
<BR>Of their ignorance-fortified authority.
<BR>
<BR>Because of its utterly pragmatic bias,
<BR>The Roman culture had no numerical concept
<BR>Of "nothing"
<BR>That corresponds to the abacus's empty column<SUP>&#95;&#95;</SUP>
<BR>That is, the idea of "no sheep"
<BR>Was ridiculous. Humans cannot eat "no sheep."
<BR>When the Europeans first adopted the Arabic numerals
<BR>in 700 A.D.
<BR>As "shorthand" for Roman numeral aggregates,
<BR>They of course encountered the Arabic cypher,
<BR>But they had no thinkably identifiable experiences to
<BR>associate with it.
<BR>"Nothing" obviously lacked "value."
<BR>For this reason, the Mediterranean Europeans
<BR>Thought of the cypher only as a decoration
<BR>Signifying the end of a communication
<BR>In the way that we use the word "over"
<BR>In contemporary radio communication.
<BR>The cypher was just an end <I>period,</I>
<BR>Just a decorative terminal symbol.
<BR>
<BR>It was not until 1200 A.D.
<BR>Or five hundred years later,
<BR>That the works of a Persian named Algorismi
<BR>Were translated into
<BR>Latin and introduced into Europe.
<BR>Algorismi lived in Carthage, North Africa.
<BR>He wrote the first treatise explaining
<BR>How the Arabic cypher functioned calculatively
<BR>By progressively moving leftward
<BR>The newly attained tenness
<BR>By elevating one bead at the bottom
<BR>Of the bottom section
<BR>Of the next leftwardly adjacent column in multiplication
<BR>And next rightwardly in division.
<BR>Thus complex computation could be effected
<BR>Which had been impossible with Roman numerals.
<A NAME="738"></A>
<BR>The Arabic cypher had been used
<BR>For several millenniums
<BR>In the computational manner,
<BR>First in the Orient,
<BR>Then in Babylon and Egypt.
<BR>But such calculations had never before been made
<BR>In the Roman Empire's Mediterranean world.
<BR>No matter how intuitively
<BR>A man might have felt
<BR>About the probable significance
<BR>Of the principle of leverage
<BR>Or about the science of falling bodies,
<BR>Previous to the knowledge
<BR>Of the cypher's capabilities to position numbers,
<BR>He could not compute
<BR>Their relative effectiveness values
<BR>Without "long" multiplication and division.
<BR>
<BR>The introduction into Europe
<BR>Of the computational significance of the cypher
<BR>Was an epoch-initiating event
<BR>For it made it possible for <I>anybody</I> to calculate.
<BR>And this was the moment in which
<BR>For the first time
<BR>The Copernicuses and Tycho Brahes,
<BR>The Galileos and Newtons,
<BR>The Keplers and Leonardos
<BR>Had computational ability.
<BR>This broke asunder the Dark Ages
<BR>With intellectual enlightenment
<BR>Regarding the scientific foundations
<BR>And technological responsibilities
<BR>Of cosmic miracles,
<BR>Now all the more miraculous
<BR>As the everyday realizer
<BR>Of all humanity's innate capabilities.
<BR>
<BR>When I first went to school in 1899,
<BR>The shopkeepers in my Massachusetts town asked me
<BR>If I had "learned to do my cyphers"
<BR>By which key word<SUP>&#95;&#95;</SUP>"cypher"<SUP>&#95;&#95;</SUP>
<A NAME="739"></A>
<BR>They as yet identified all mathematics.
<BR>Even in 1970
<BR>Accountants in India
<BR>Are known officially as "cypherists."
<BR>
<BR>Tobias Dantzig, author of <I>Number: The Language of Science,</I>
<BR>Has traced the etymological history
<BR>Of the names for the numbers
<BR>In all the known languages of the Earth.
<BR>He finds the names for numbers all classifiable
<BR>As amongst the "oldest" known words.
<BR>Sir James Jeans said "Science is the attempt
<BR>To set in order the facts of experience."
<BR>Dantzig, being a good scientist,
<BR>Undertook to set in order
<BR>The experienced facts of the history
<BR>Of the language of number names.
<BR>He arranged them experimentally
<BR>In their respective ethnic language columns.
<BR>Juxtaposed in this way
<BR>We are provided with new historical insights.
<BR>For instance, we learn
<BR>That if we are confronted
<BR>With two numbers of different languages,
<BR>Words that we have never seen before,
<BR>And an authority assures us
<BR>That one of these words means "one"
<BR>And the other means "two,"
<BR>And we are then asked to guess
<BR>Which of them means "one"
<BR>And which means "two,"
<BR>We will be surprised to find
<BR>That we can tell easily which is which.
<BR>"One" in every language
<BR>Starts with a vowel<SUP>&#95;&#95;</SUP>
<BR>Eins, un, odyn, unus, yet, ahed<SUP>&#95;&#95;</SUP>
<BR>And has vowel sound emphasis,
<BR>While "two" always has a consonant sound in the front<SUP>&#95;&#95;</SUP>
<BR>Duo, zwei, dva, nee, tnayn, and so forth,
<BR>And has a consonant sound emphasis.
<BR>For instance, the Irish-Gaelic
<BR>Whose ancestors were sea rovers
<BR>Say "an" for one and "do" for two.
<BR>These vowel-consonant relations
<BR>Hold through into the teens<SUP>&#95;&#95;</SUP>
<BR>Eleven, twelve<SUP>&#95;&#95;</SUP>in English
<BR>Onze, douze<SUP>&#95;&#95;</SUP>in French
<BR>Elf, zwoelf<SUP>&#95;&#95;</SUP>in German,
<BR>With vowels for "oneness"
<BR>And consonants for "twoness."
<BR>
<BR>Despite the dissimilarity in different languages
<BR>For the names for the same experiences,
<BR>And despite the unknown origins of the concepts
<BR>From which all numbers but five were derived,
<BR>The whole array of names for the numbers
<BR>In different languages
<BR>Makes it perfectly clear
<BR>That the names given the numbers around the world
<BR>Grew from the same fundamental
<BR>Conceptioning and sound roots.
<BR>
<BR>In view of the foregoing discovery,
<BR>We either have to say that some angels
<BR>Invented the names for numbers
<BR>And the phonetically soundable
<BR>Alphabetical letter symbols
<BR>With which to spell them
<BR>And wrote them on parchments
<BR>And air-dropped those number-name leaflets
<BR>All around the spherical world,
<BR>Thus teaching world-around people the same number names:
<BR>Or we have to say that the numbers were invented
<BR>By one-world-around-traveling people.
<BR>
<BR>However, if we adopt the latter possibility,
<BR>It becomes obvious that no single generation of people
<BR>Could, within its lifetime,
<BR>Or, in fact, within many lifetimes
<A NAME="741"></A>
<BR>Travel all around the world on foot,
<BR>For the world's lands are islanded.
<BR>But one way humans could get around,
<BR>And in a relative hurry,
<BR>Was by "high-seas-keeping" sailboats.
<BR>It thus becomes intuitively logical
<BR>To assume that sailors discovered
<BR>And invented the numbers
<BR>And inculcated their use
<BR>All around the world.
<BR>
<BR>The Polynesians, we know,
<BR>Sailed all over the Pacific.
<BR>They probably sailed
<BR>From there into the Atlantic and Indian oceans
<BR>By riding ever-west-toward-east "Roaring Forties"<SUP>&#95;&#95;</SUP>
<BR>The Forty-South latitudes'
<BR>Ever-eastward-revolving
<BR>Waters and atmospheric winds
<BR>Which circle around the vast Antarctic continent.
<BR>The "Roaring Forties"
<BR>Constitute a gigantic hydraulic-pneumatic merry-go-round,
<BR>Which as demonstrated by
<BR>World-around single-handing sailors of the 1960s
<BR>Enables those who master its ferocious waters
<BR>To encircle the world
<BR>Within only a year's time.
<BR>The Magellans, Cooks, and Slocums
<BR>With slower vessels circumnavigated in two years,
<BR>In contradistinction to the absolute inability
<BR>To go all around the world on foot.
<BR>The circumnavigation of the one-ocean world
<BR>Which covers three-quarters of our planet
<BR>Makes it obvious that the names for numbers
<BR>Were conceived by the sailors.
<BR>As Magellan, Cook, and later Slocum
<BR>Came to the Tierra del Fuego islanders,
<BR>They were surrounded by the islanders,
<BR>Who lived by pillaging passing ships
<BR>And must have been doing so
<BR>Profitably for millenniums.
<A NAME="742"></A>
<BR>To explain their sustained generations
<BR>In an environment approximately devoid
<BR>Of favorable human survival,
<BR>Except by piracy and salvage
<BR>Of the world-around sailing vessels
<BR>Funneled through the narrow
<BR>And incredibly tumultuous
<BR>Waters of the Horn Running between Antarctica and South America,
<BR>With often daily occurring
<BR>One-hundred-feet high waves
<BR>Cresting at the height
<BR>Of ten-story buildings,
<BR>Their thousand-ton tops
<BR>Tumblingly sheared off to leeward
<BR>By hundred-miles-an-hour superhurricanes
<BR>Avoidance of whose worst ferocities
<BR>Could be accomplished by winding
<BR>Through the Strait of Magellan,
<BR>Whose fishtrap-like strategic enticement
<BR>Often lured Pacific-Atlantic sea traffic
<BR>Into those pirates' forlorn domain.
<BR>
<BR>With eighty-five percent of Earth's dry land
<BR>And ninety percent of its people
<BR>Occupying and dwelling north of the Equator
<BR>In the northern, or land-dominant, hemisphere;
<BR>And with less than one-tenth of one percent of humanity
<BR>Dwelling in the southernmost half
<BR>Of the southern, or wave-dominated, Earth hemisphere,
<BR>There is more and more scientific evidence accruing
<BR>That sailors have been encircling the Earth
<BR>South of Good Hope,
<BR>North or south of Australia,
<BR>And through the Horn
<BR>Consciously and competently
<BR>For many thousands of millenniums
<BR>All unknown to the ninety-nine percent of humanity
<BR>That has been "rooted" locally To their dry-land livelihoods.
<BR>The European scholars of the last millennium
<BR>Have considered the Polynesians to be illiterate
<BR>And therefore intellectually inferior to Europeans
<BR>Because the Polynesians didn't have a written history
<BR>And used only a binary mathematics,
<BR>Or "congruence in modulo two."
<BR>The European scholars scoffed,
<BR>"The Polynesians can only count to two."
<BR>
<A NAME="743"></A>
<BR>Since the Polynesians lived on the sea
<BR>And were naked,
<BR>Anything upon which they wrote
<BR>Could be washed overboard.
<BR>The Polynesians themselves
<BR>Often fell overboard.
<BR>They had no pockets
<BR>Nor any other means
<BR>Of retaining reminder devices
<BR>Or calculating and scribing instruments
<BR>Other than by rings
<BR>That could not slip off
<BR>From their fingers, ankles, wrists, and necks,
<BR>Or by comblike items
<BR>That were precariously
<BR>Tied into the hair on their heads
<BR>Or by rings piercing their ears and noses.
<BR>These sea people had to invent ways of calculating and
<BR>communicating
<BR>Principally by brain-rememberable pattern images.
<BR>They accomplished their rememberable patterns in sound,
<BR>They remembered them in chants.
<BR>With day after day of time to spend at sea
<BR>They learned to sing and repeat these chants.
<BR>Using the successive bow-to-stern,
<BR>Canoe and dugout, stiffing ribs and thwarts
<BR>Or rafters of their great rafts
<BR>As re-minders of successive generations of ancestors,
<BR>They methodically and recitationally recalled
<BR>The experiences en-chantingly taught to them
<BR>As a successive-generation,
<BR>Oral relay system
<BR>Specifically identified with the paired ancestral parents,
<BR>Represented by each pair of ship's ribs or rafters.
<BR>When they landed for long periods
<BR>They upside-downed their longboats
<BR>To provide dry-from-rain habitats.
<BR>(The word for "roof" in Japan
<BR>Also means "bottom of boat.")
<BR>Staying longer than the wood-life of their hulls,
<BR>They built long halls patterned after the hulls.
<BR>Each successive column and roof rafter
<BR>Corresponded with a rib of their long boat.
<BR>Gradually they came to carve
<BR>Each stout tree column's wood
<BR>To represent an ancestor's image.
<BR>Each opposing pair of parallel columns
<BR>Represented a pair of ancestors:
<BR>The male on the one hand
<BR>And the female on the other hand.
<BR>While most Europeans or Americans can recall
<BR>Only ten or less generations of ancestors,
<BR>In their chants
<BR>The Polynesians can recall
<BR>As much as one hundred generations
<BR>Of paired ancestors,
<BR>And their chants include
<BR>The history of their important discoveries
<BR>Such as of specific-star-to-specific-star directions
<BR>to be followed at sea
<BR>In order to navigate from here to there.
<BR>While many of the words
<BR>That their ancestors evolved
<BR>To describe their discoveries
<BR>Have lost present-day identification,
<BR>They continue to sing these words
<BR>In faithful confidence
<BR>That their significant meaning
<BR>Will some day emerge.
<BR>Therefore, they teach their children
<BR>As they themselves were taught<SUP>&#95;&#95;</SUP>
<BR>To chant successively the special stories
<BR>Which include words of lost meaning<SUP>&#95;&#95;</SUP>
<BR>Describing each one of every pair of ancestors.
<A NAME="745"></A>
<BR>That is why the Vikings
<BR>Had their chants and sagas
<BR>And why sailors all around the world
<BR>Chant their chanties<SUP>&#95;&#95;</SUP>"shanties"
<BR>As they heave-hoed rhythmically together.
<BR>
<BR>Thus too did the Viking sing their sagas;
<BR>And the Japanese and Indian sailors their ragas;
<BR>And the Balinese sailors their gagas,
<BR>Meaning "tales of the old people,"
<BR>Amongst all those high-seas-living world dwellers
<BR>Whose single language structure
<BR>Served the thirty-million-square-mile living Maoris;
<BR>Whereas hundreds of fundamentally different languages
<BR>Were of static-existence necessity developed,
<BR>For instance, by isolatedly living tribes
<BR>Of exclusively inland-dwelling New Guineans.
<BR>
<BR>A nineteenth-century sailor's shanty goes
<BR>"One, two, three, four
<BR>Sometimes I wish there were more.
<BR>Eins, zwei, drei, vier
<BR>I love the one that's near.
<BR>Yet, nee, same, see
<BR>So says the heathen Chinese.
<BR>Fair girls bereft
<BR>Then will get left
<BR>One, two, and three."
<BR>
<BR>As complex twentieth-century,
<BR>Electronically actuated computers
<BR>Have come into use,
<BR>Ever improving methodology
<BR>For gaining greater use advantage
<BR>Of the computers' capabilities,
<BR>As information storing,
<BR>Retrieving, and interprocessing devices,
<BR>Has induced reassessment
<BR>Of relative mathematical systems' efficiencies.
<BR>This in turn has induced
<BR>Scientific discovery
<A NAME="746"></A>
<BR>That binary computation
<BR>Or operation by "congruence in modulo two"
<BR>Is by far the most efficient and swift system
<BR>For dealing universally with complex computation.
<BR>In this connection we recall that the Phoenicians
<BR>Also as sailor people
<BR>Were forced to keep their mercantile records
<BR>And recollections in sound patterns,
<BR>In contradistinction to tactile and visual scratching<SUP>&#95;&#95;</SUP>
<BR>And that the Phoenicians to implement
<BR>Their world-around trading
<BR>Invented the Phoenician,
<BR>Or Phonetic, or word-sound alphabet,
<BR>With which to correlate and record graphically
<BR>The various sound patterns and pronunciations
<BR>Of the dialects they encountered In their world-around
<BR>trading.
<BR>And we suddenly realize
<BR>How brilliant and conceptually advanced
<BR>Were the Phoenicians' high-seas predecessors,
<BR>The Polynesians,
<BR>For the latter had long centuries earlier
<BR>Discovered the binary system of mathematics
<BR>Whose "congruence in modulo two"
<BR>Provided unambiguous,
<BR>Yes-no; go-no go,
<BR>Cybernetic controls
<BR>Of the electronic circuitry
<BR>For the modern computer,
<BR>As it had for millenniums earlier
<BR>Functioned most efficiently
<BR>In storing and retrieving
<BR>All the special-case data
<BR>In the brains of the Polynesians
<BR>By their chanted programming
<BR>And their persistent retention
<BR>Of the specific but no-longer-comprehended
<BR>Sound pattern words and sequences
<BR>Taught by their successive
<BR>Go-no go, male-female pairs of ancestors.
<A NAME="747"></A>
<BR>This realization forces rejection of the European scholars'
<BR>Former depreciation of the Polynesian competence,
<BR>Which reversal is typical
<BR>In both conceptioning and logic
<BR>Of the myriad of concept reversals
<BR>That are now taking place
<BR>And are about to occur
<BR>In vastly greater degree
<BR>In the late twentieth-century academic world.
<BR>The general education system
<BR>Has not yet formally acknowledged
<BR>The wholesale devaluation
<BR>Of their formally held
<BR>"Scholarly opinions and hypotheses,"
<BR>But that devaluation
<BR>Is indeed taking place
<BR>And is powerfully manifest
<BR>In the students' loss of esteem
<BR>For their intellectual wares.
<BR>
<BR>All of the foregoing
<BR>Newly dawning realizations
<BR>Point up the significance
<BR>Of the world-around physically cross-bred kinship
<BR>Of the world's "one-ocean" sailors
<BR>Whose Atlantic, Pacific, and Indian waters
<BR>Were powerfully interconnected
<BR>By the Antarctic-encircling
<BR>"Roaring Forties."
<BR>Polynesians, Phoenicians, Venetians, Frisians, Vikings
<BR>(Pronounced "Veekings" by the Vikings)
<BR>All alliterations of the same words.
<BR>All evolved from the same ancestors.
<BR>
<BR>The sea was their normal life,
<BR>And since three-quarters of the Earth's surface
<BR>Is covered with water,
<BR>"Normal" life would mean living on the sea.
<BR>The Polynesians spontaneously conceive of an island
<BR>As a "hole" in the ocean.
<A NAME="748"></A>
<BR>Such conceptioning of a negative hole in experience
<BR>Brought about their natural invention
<BR>Of a symbol for nothing<SUP>&#95;&#95;</SUP>the zero.
<BR>This is negative space conceptioning
<BR>And is evident in the Maori paintings.
<BR>What is a peninsula to land people
<BR>Is a "bay" to them.
<BR>The Maori also look at males and females
<BR>In the reverse primacy of the land-stranded Western
<BR>culture.
<BR>Seventy-five percent of the planet is covered by the sea.
<BR>The sea is normal.
<BR>The male is the sailor.
<BR>The male is normal.
<BR>The penis of the normal sea
<BR>Intrudes into the female land.
<BR>The bay is a penis of the sea.
<BR>The females dwell upon the land.
<BR>To the landsman the peninsula or penis
<BR>Juts out into the ocean.
<BR>
<BR>On the Indian Ocean side of southeast Africa,
<BR>The Zulus are linked with this round-the-world water
<BR>sailing.
<BR>They are probably evolved from the Polynesians of long
<BR>ago
<BR>Swept westward by the monsoons.
<BR>I found some of the Zulu chiefs
<BR>Wearing discs in their ears
<BR>Upon which the cardinal points of the compass
<BR>Were clearly marked.
<BR>The "Long Ears" of Easter Island
<BR>Had their ears pierced and stretched
<BR>To accommodate their navigational devices.
<BR>Many of the items which European society
<BR>Has misidentified in the Fijis as superstitious decoration
<BR>Were and as yet are
<BR>Navigational information-storing devices,
<BR>Being stored, for instance,
<BR>As star-pattern combs in their hair,
<BR>As rings around their necks,
<BR>Or as multiple bracelets
<BR>Mounted on their two arms and two legs,
<BR>And multiple rings
<BR>Upon the four fingers of their hands.
<BR>They had thirteen columns of slidable counters,
<BR>One neck, eight fingers, two arms, two legs.
<BR>Most of the earliest known abacuses
<BR>Also have thirteen columns of ring (bead) counters
<BR>Which became more convenient to manipulate and retain
<BR>When rib-bellied ships
<BR>Supplanted the open raft and catamaran.
<BR>Once the mathematical conceptioning
<BR>Of sliding rings on thirteen columns
<BR>Had been evolved by the navigators, traders, magicians,
<BR>It was no trick at all
<BR>To reproduce the thirteen-column system
<BR>In a wooden frame with bamboo slide columns.
<BR>
<BR>By virtue of their ability to go
<BR>From the known here to the popularly unknown there,
<BR>The navigators were able to psychologically control
<BR>Their local island chieftains.
<BR>If a chieftain needed a miracle
<BR>To offset diminishing credit by his people,
<BR>He could confront them with his divine power
<BR>By exhibiting some object they had never seen before,
<BR>Because it was nonexistent
<BR>On their particular island.
<BR>All the chieftain had to do
<BR>Was to ask the navigators
<BR>To exercise their mysterious ability
<BR>To disappear at sea
<BR>And return days later with an unfamiliar object.
<BR>But the navigators kept secret
<BR>Their mathematical knowledge
<BR>Of offshore celestial navigation
<BR>And the lands they thus were able to reach.
<BR>
<BR>To the landed chieftains
<BR>The seagoing navigators were mysterious priests.
<BR>The South Seas navigators lived and as yet live
<BR>Absolutely apart from the chieftains and the tribe
<BR>The "priests" taught only their sons about navigation
<BR>And they did so only at sea.
<BR>A new era dawned
<BR>For humanity on our planet
<BR>When the Polynesians learned
<BR>How to sail zigzaggingly to windward
<BR>Into the prevailing west-to-east winds.
<BR>Able to sail westward<SUP>&#95;&#95;</SUP>
<BR>Able to follow the Sun<SUP>&#95;&#95;</SUP>
<BR>At far greater sustainable
<BR>(All day and all night, day after day)
<BR>Sailing speeds than those attainable
<BR>By paddling or rowing into head seas;
<BR>Having for all time theretofore drifted
<BR>In predominantly eastward windblown directions,
<BR>Or gone aimlessly where ocean currents bore them,
<BR>Yielding to the inevitable
<BR>From-west-to-east elements
<BR>Bearing them to the American west coasts
<BR>And to all the Pacific islands
<BR>Throughout the previous <I>x</I> millions of years.
<BR>
<BR>Whereas the Southern Hemisphere ocean
<BR>Was dominated by the west-east "Roaring Forties,"
<BR>The Polynesians when entering the Northern Hemisphere
<BR>Were advantaged not only by their ability
<BR>To sail into the wind,
<BR>But also by the east-west counter-currents
<BR>Of the tropical westward trade winds,
<BR>Which they discovered and
<BR>Called so because they made it possible
<BR>To go back where man had previously been
<BR>And thus to integrate world resources.
<BR>Thus the secretly held navigational capability
<BR>And knowledge of the elemental counting and astronomy
<BR>Went westward from Polynesia
<BR>Throughout Malaysia and to southern India,
<BR>Across the Indian Ocean to Mesopotamia and Egypt
<BR>And thence into the Mediterranean.
<BR>The powerful priests of Babylon, Egypt, and Crete
<BR>Were the progeny of mathematician navigators of the Pacific
<BR>Come up upon the land
<BR>To guide and miracle-ize the new kings
<BR>Of the Western Worlds.

<BR>Knowing all about boats,
<BR>These navigator priests were the only people
<BR>Who knew that the Earth is spherical,
<BR>That the Earth is a closed system
<BR>With its myriad resources chartable.
<BR>But being water people,
<BR>They kept their charts in their heads
<BR>And relayed the information
<BR>To their navigator progeny
<BR>Exclusively in esoterical,
<BR>Legendary, symbolical codings
<BR>Embroidered into their chants.
<BR>
<BR>But some of their numbers
<BR>Also sailed deliberately eastward
<BR>Carrying their mathematical skills
<BR>To west-coast America.
<BR>
<BR>The Mayans used base twenty in their numerical system
<BR>By counting with both their fingers and toes.
<BR>The number twenty often occurs
<BR>In a "magically" strategic way.
<BR>For an example
<BR>We can look at symmetrical aggregates
<BR>Of progressively assembled spheres
<BR>Closest packed on a plane<SUP>&#95;&#95;</SUP>a pool table.
<BR>First take two balls and make them tangent.
<BR>Tangent is the "closest"
<BR>That spheres may come to one another.
<BR>We may next nest a third ball
<BR>In the valley between the first tangent two.
<BR>Now each of the three spheres is tangent to two others
<BR>And none can get closer to each other.
<BR>These three make a triangle.
<BR>There is no ball in the center
<BR>Of the triangular group.
<BR>We can now add three more balls to the first three
<BR>By arranging them tangentially in a row
<BR>Along one edge of the first three's triangle.
<BR>As yet, all six balls are arranged
<BR>As outside edges of the triangle.
<BR>Not until we add a fourth row of balls
<BR>Nested along one edge of the triangular aggregate
<BR>Does a single ball become placed as the nuclear ball
<BR>In the center of the triangular "patterned" ball pool-table array.
<BR>Ten is the total number of balls
<BR>In this first nuclear-ball-containing triangle:
<BR>Nine surround the nuclear tenth ball.
<BR>And since a triangle is a fundamental structural pattern,
<BR>And since the triangular aggregate
<BR>Of nine balls around a nuclear one
<BR>Is a symmetrical array,
<BR>Man's intuitive choice of "congruence in modulo ten"
<BR>May have been more subtly conceived
<BR>Than simply by coincidence
<BR>With the ten digits of his hands.
<BR>
<BR>We will now see what happens experimentally
<BR>When sailors stack coconut or orange cargoes
<BR>Or when we stack planar groups of triangular aggregates of spheres
<BR>On top of one another in such a manner that they will be
<BR>Structurally stable without binding agents.
<BR>
<BR>First we will nest six balls
<BR>In a closest-packed triangular planar array
<BR>On top of the first triangularly arranged ten-ball aggregate.
<BR>And on top of those six balls
<BR>We can nest three more.
<BR>We now have a total of nineteen balls.
<BR>We may now nest one more topmost ball
<BR>In the one "nest" of the three-ball triangle.
<BR>We now have a symmetrical
<BR>Tetrahedral aggregate
<BR>Consisting of twenty balls
<BR>Without any nuclear ball
<BR>Occurring in the center
<BR>Of the symmetrical tetrahedral pyramid of balls.
<BR>We began our vertical stacking
<BR>With a symmetrical base triangle of ten balls,
<BR>And now we have a tetrahedron composed of twenty balls.
<BR>Just as fingers alone may not have been the only reason
<BR>For the choice of base ten,
<BR>Fingers and toes together may not have been the only reason
<A NAME="753"></A>
<BR>That the Mayan priests chose
<BR>Congruence in modulo twenty
<BR>Or that twenty was considered a magical number.
<BR>It might have been the result of an intuitive understanding
<BR>Of closest packing of spheres,
<BR>Which is something much more fundamental.
<BR>For unlike our fingers which lie in a row,
<BR>The packing of twenty spheres
<BR>That can be grouped symmetrically together without a nucleus
<BR>Is a fundamentally significant phenomenon.
<BR>In a tetrahedron composed of twenty balls
<BR>There is no nucleus.
<BR>This may be why twenty appears so abundantly
<BR>In the different chemical element isotopes.
<BR>And "twenty" is one of the "Magic Numbers"
<BR>In the inventory of chemical-element isotopal abundancy in Universe.
<BR>
<BR>In order to position a nuclear ball in the center
<BR>Of a symmetrical tetrahedral pyramid of balls,
<BR>We need to add another or fifth nested layer of fifteen
<BR>balls
<BR>To one face of the tetrahedron of twenty.
<BR>The total number of balls is then thirty-five,
<BR>Of which one is the nuclear ball.
<BR>If, however, we add four
<BR>Progressively larger
<BR>Triangular layers of balls
<BR>To each of the four triangular faces
<BR>Of the twenty-ball, no-nucleus tetrahedron,
<BR>It will take exactly one hundred more balls
<BR>To enclose the twenty-ball, no-nucleus tetrahedron<SUP>&#95;&#95;</SUP>
<BR>This makes a symmetrical tetrahedron
<BR>Of one hundred and twenty balls.
<BR>This symmetrical tetrahedron
<BR>Is the largest symmetrical assembly
<BR>Of closest-packed spheres nowhere containing
<BR>Any two-layer-covered nuclear spheres
<BR>That is experimentally demonstrable.
<BR>In the external affairs of spheres
<BR>Such omnidimensional spherical groupings
<BR>Of one hundred and twenty same-size balls
<BR>Without a nucleus ball
<A NAME="754"></A>
<BR>Can be logically identified
<BR>With the internal affairs
<BR>Of individual spheres,
<BR>Wherein we rediscovered
<BR>The one hundred and twenty,
<BR>Least-common-denominator,
<BR>Right spherical triangles of the sphere,
<BR>Which are archeologically documented
<BR>As having been well known to the Babylonians'
<BR>Come-out-upon-the-land-ocean,
<BR>Navigator-high-priest mathematicians.
<BR>
<BR>The number 120 also appears as a "Magic Number"
<BR>In the relative-abundance hierarchy
<BR>Of chemical-element isotopes of Universe.
<BR>One hundred and twenty accommodates
<BR>Both the decimal and the duodecimal system
<BR>(Ten multiplied by twelve).
<BR>
<BR>The Mayans too may have understood
<BR>About the tetrahedral closest packing of spheres.
<BR>They probably made such tetrahedra
<BR>With symmetrically closest-packed stacks of oranges.
<BR>
<BR>The twentieth-century fruit-store man
<BR>Spontaneously stacks his spherical fruits
<BR>In such closest-packed
<BR>Stacking and nesting arrays.
<BR>But the physicists didn't pay any attention
<BR>To the fruit-store man until 1922.
<BR>Then for the first time physicists
<BR>Called the tetrahedral stacks of fruit
<BR>"Closest packing of spheres."
<BR>For centuries past
<BR>The numerologists had paid attention
<BR>To the closest packing of spheres In tetrahedral pyramids,
<BR>But were given the academic heave-ho
<BR>When in the mid-nineteenth century
<BR>Physicists abandoned the concept of models.
<A NAME="755"></A>
<BR>We have seen
<BR>That there are unique or cardinal names
<BR>For the concepts one through twelve
<BR>In England and Germany,
<BR>And for the concepts one through sixteen in France,
<BR>But that after that they simply repeat
<BR>In whatever congruence modulos
<BR>They happen to be working.
<BR>The Arabic numerals as well as their names
<BR>Are unique and stand alone
<BR>Only from zero through nine.
<BR>However, eleven is the result of two ones<SUP>&#95;&#95;</SUP>11,
<BR>And twelve is similarly fashioned from two
<BR>Previously given symbols,
<BR>Namely, one and two<SUP>&#95;&#95;</SUP>12.
<BR>
<BR>But certain numbers
<BR>Such as prime numbers
<BR>Have their own cosmic integrity
<BR>And therefore ought to be integrally expressed.
<BR>What the numerologist does
<BR>Is to add numerals horizontally (120=1+2+0=3)
<BR>Until they are all consolidated into one integer.
<BR>Numerologists have also assigned
<BR>To the letters of the alphabet
<BR>Corresponding numbers: A is one, B is two, C is three, etc.
<BR>Numerologists wishfully assume
<BR>That they can identify
<BR>Characteristics of people
<BR>By the residual integer
<BR>Derived from integrating
<BR>All of the integers,
<BR>(Which integers
<BR>They speak of as digits,
<BR>Identifying with the fingers of their hands,
<BR>That is, their fingers.)
<BR>Corresponding to all the letters
<BR>In the individual's complete set of names.
<BR>Numerologists do not pretend to be scientific.
<BR>They are just fascinated
<BR>With correspondence of their key digits
<BR>With various happenstances of existence.
<BR>They have great fun
<BR>Identifying events and things
<BR>And assuming significant insights
<BR>Which from time to time
<BR>Seem well justified,
<BR>But what games numerologists
<BR>Chose to play with these tools
<BR>May or may not have been significant.
<BR>Possibly by coincidence, however,
<BR>And possibly because of number integrity itself
<BR>Some of the integer intergrating results
<BR>Are found to correspond elegantly
<BR>With experimentally proven, physical laws
<BR>And have subsequently proven to be
<BR>Infinitely reliable.
<BR>Half a century ago I became interested in seeing
<BR>How numerologists played their games.
<BR>I found myself increasingly intrigued
<BR>And continually integrating digits.
