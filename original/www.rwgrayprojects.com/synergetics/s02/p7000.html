symmetrically
concentric, multistaged but continually smooth (click-stop

 In the era before the measurement of the speed of
light scientists assumed an
instant, unitarily conceptual, normally-at-rest (but
for the moment, and only locally,
perversely restless) Universe. Before the 20th-century
discoveries of other galaxies and in
the early days of thermodynamics and its disclosure
of entropy<SUP>&#95;&#95;</SUP>the inexorable systemic
loss of energy<SUP>&#95;&#95;</SUP>the scientists were prone to assume that
the vast instantaneous cosmic
machine as a thermodynamic system must itself be "running
down"<SUP>&#95;&#95;</SUP>that is, continually
spending itself entropically and trending eventually
to self-annihilation.

 Boltzmann contradicted that assumption by saying in
effect that the a priori
fact of the existence of billions of stars radiantly
and entropically broadcasting their
energies must require an as-yet-undiscovered but obviously
operative energy redistribution
system by which stars are elsewhere and elsewhen assemblingly
formed. Boltzmann
therefore assumed a cosmic complex of invisible energy-importing
centers whose
nonsimultaneous formations but sum-total, long-run energy
importing exactly balances all
the long-run cosmic exportings. The entropic radiance
of the exporting centers makes
them visible to us, while the importing centers are
inherently invisible, except when
starlight bounces reflectively off them as does Sunlight
make the Moon<SUP>&#95;&#95;</SUP>and the planets
Venus, Jupiter, Mars, and Saturn<SUP>&#95;&#95;</SUP>reflectively visible
to us Earthians.

 Because Boltzmann could not demonstrate the astrophysical
presence of
such inherently invisible importing centers, his concept
was not widely accepted by other
scientists. Einstein, however, later supported Boltzmann's
concept as constituting a logical
corollary of Einstein's own implicit concept of the
Universe as an aggregate of
nonsimultaneous, variously enduring, and only partially
overlapping energy events.
Though Einstein did not employ the analogy, his was
in effect an endless ropelike concept
of variously enduring, finite, special case episodes
converging in generalized principle to
apparent interrelevance and overlapping one another
momentarily to constitute a fat- or
thin-diametered rope of meaningful concern as might
preoccupy any one cosmologist at
any one time.

 Among their many sophisticated mathematical devices
mathematicians' most
advanced conceptual tool is the topology of Leonhard
Euler, whose three irreducible
visualizable aspects of <I>vertexes V, planar faces or
areas F,</I> and <I>edges of faces or lines E</I>
seem to the geometrically heedless mathematical physicists
and astrophysicists to have no
inherent correspondence with experimentally demonstrable
energetic reality.

 Synergetics and operational mathematics find that
by combining topology
and vectorial geometry, and by always requiring structural
stability and intertransformative
proofs in four-dimensional electromagnetic reality for
all propositions, and by starting with
minimum conceptuality of a substantive entity as having
inherent insideness and
outsideness, <I>it is in evidence </I>
<UL>
<LI> that the minimum polyhedron (the tetrahedron) consists
entirely of minimum
polygons (triangles);
<LI> that the minimum polyhedron systematically and inherently
divides all Universe
into (a) an excluded macrocosm, (b) an included microcosm,
and (c) the
remainder of Universe constituting the dividing system
itself;
<LI> that this tune-in-able minimum, systemic, primitive
entity is apprehensible
conceptually because of its contrast to the “nothingness”
of the presently untuned-
in and un-tune-in-able (within the limited frequency
range of the human
observer's given equipment);
<LI> that the cosmically comprehensive equilibrium of all
vectors provides the
geometrically conceptual field of <I>structuring-as-you-go</I>
reference and is known as
the four-dimensional isotropic vector, meaning cosmically

and unapprehendible in any special case time-size reality<SUP>&#95;&#95;</SUP>but
both intellectually
and geometrically conceptualized in synergetics' vectorial,
angular-oriented
comprehensivity; and

 Euler shows that in respect to all uncored polyhedra
the number of vertexes
plus the number of faces always equals the number of
edges plus the number 2  (V+F=E+2).
But the diversion of this formula into local aspects
of polyhedra introduced a nonexistent
two-dimensionality, allowing the mathematicians to detour
around reality. Academic
mathematicians (themselves indifferent to physical manifestation
of experimental evidence)
have detoured Euler's concepts into such games as that
of the pretended existence of a
substanceless rubber sheet having no insideness but
only a one-way-at-a-time-facing
surface with no edge thickness or obverse surface. On
such an imaginary surface Euler's
vertexes, faces, and edges have been distortingly redeployed.

 Euler was almost blind, but with his compensatorily
vivid imagination he
discovered that all visual experiences could be reduced
to three prime aspects: <I>lines,</I> and
where lines converge to <I>vertexes,</I> and where lines surroundingly
cross one another to
describe <I>areas</I> bound by those lines. Because his topology
was concerned with only visual
aspects, Euler was able to overlook substantial textures,
sounds, tastes, and smells;
temperatures, weights, and volumes; durations, intensities,
frequencies, and velocities. But
he was so great a scientist and so competent a mathematician
that he evolved the
fundamentals of structural analysis employed in the
20th century in designing structures of
land, sea, sky, and extraterrestrial functioning.

 The chemist Willard Gibbs, developed the phase rule
dealing with liquid,
gaseous, and crystalline states of substances, apparently
not realizing that his phase rule
employed the same generalized mathematics as that of
Euler's topological vertexes, faces,

 Synergetics is concerned exclusively with physically
demonstrable, and thus
experimentally evidenceable, phenomena. Synergetics
adds to Euler’s topology its
discovery of the mathematically generalizable constant
relative interabundance of angles,
volumes, and all the physical characteristics of time-space
velocity, force, wavelength and
frequency, directional orientation, and systems consideration<SUP>&#95;&#95;</SUP>always
identifying Euler's
edge lines <I>E</I> as representative only of physical energy
vectors or metaphysical lines of
unique interrelationships of vertexially located phenomena.
Vectors are discrete in length,
being the product of physical velocity and mass operating
in a given angularly describable
direction in respect to a given axis of observation.
Velocity is a product of time and
distance, while mass is a relative density of energy
events per given volume; wherefore all
the qualities of physical experience are describable
in a unified four-dimensional field, a
state at which physical Universe never tarries, and
relative to which (and through which)
all of nature's physical manifestations are local, differentially
frequenced aberratings and
pulsative omniconvergent-divergent, omniinteraccommodative
transformings.

 Since the sum of the chordally convergent angles of
any triangle (right,
isosceles, or scalene) is always 180 degrees, the sum
of the angles of any chordally defined
tetrahedron, regular or irregular, is always 720 degrees;
therefore, all its topological and
geometrical interrelationship properties are consistently
similar<SUP>&#95;&#95;</SUP>ergo, universal
independently of time-size considerations.

 We start our vectorial, topological, structuring-as-you-go
exploration with
the primitive state of conceptuality (independent of
size and time) of the universal
tetrahedron, with its four triangular facets, its four
corners, its 12 angles, and its six most
economical, chordal, interrelationship lines running
between its four-corner event foci.

 In exploring the intertransformability of the primitive
hierarchy of
structuring-as-you-go, with its omnitriangularly oriented
evolution and the interbonding of
its evolving structural components, we soon discover
that the universal interjointing of
systems and their foldability permit the angularly hinged
convergence into congruence of
vectors, faces, and vertexes as demonstrated in the
<I>vector equilibrium jitterbug</I> (Sec.
<A HREF="../s04/p6000.html#460.00">460</A>),
each of whose multicongruences appears as only
one edge or one vertex or one face
aspect. Topological accounting as conventionally practiced
accounts each of these
multicongruent aspects as consisting of only one such
aspect. Only synergetics accounts
for the presence of all the congruent aspects<SUP>&#95;&#95;</SUP>double,
triple, or fourfold<SUP>&#95;&#95;</SUP>by always
accounting for the initial inventory of the comprehensive
tetravolume-48 rhombic
dodecahedron and the 20 tetravolume vector equilibrium,
together with their initial or
primitive inventory of vertexes, faces, and edge lines,
which are always present in all
stages of the 48<IMG SRC="../figs/rparrow.gif">1 jitterbug
convergence transformation,
though often imperceptibly so.

 With recognition of the foregoing topological deceptiveness,
and always
keeping account of the primitive total inventory of
such aspects, we find it possible to
demonstrate conceptually and to prove the validity not
only of Boltzmann's concepts but
of all quantum phenomena. This makes it possible to
interlink the mathematical accounting
of synergetics conceptually with the operational data
of physics and chemistry as well as
with the complex associabilities of their related disciplines.
