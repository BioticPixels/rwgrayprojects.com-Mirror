<TR><TD>Fig. 222.01 <I>Equation for Omnidirectional Closest Packing
of Spheres:</I> Omnidirectional concentric
closest packings of equal spheres about a nuclear sphere
form series of vector equilibria of progressively
higher frequencies. The number of spheres or vertexes
on any symmetrically concentric shell outer
layer is given by the equation 10 F<SUP>2</SUP> + 2, where F =
Frequency. The frequency can be considered as the
number of layers (concentric shells or radius) or the
number of edge modules on the vector equilibrium.
A one-frequency sphere packing system has 12 spheres
on the outer layer (A) and a one-frequency
vector equilibrium has 12 vertexes. If another layer
of spheres are packed around the one-frequency
system, exactly 42 additional spheres are required to
make this a two-frequency system (B). If still
another layer of spheres is added to the two-frequency
system, exactly 92 additional spheres are
required to make the three-frequency system (C). A four-frequency
system will have 162 spheres on its
outer layer. A five-frequency system will have 252 spheres
on its outer layer, etc.
