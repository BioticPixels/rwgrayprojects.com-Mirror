 Discoveries are uniquely regenerative to the explorer
and are most powerful
on those rare occasions when a generalized principle
is discovered. When mind discovers a
generalized principle permeating whole fields of special-case
experiences, the discovered
relationship is awesomely and elatingly beautiful to
the discoverer personally, not only
because to the best of his knowledge it has been heretofore
unknown, but also because of
the intuitively sensed potential of its effect upon
knowledge and the consequently
improved advantages accruing to humanity’s survival
and growth struggle in Universe.
The stimulation is not that of the discoverer of a diamond,
which is a physical entity that
may be monopolized or exploited only to the owner’s
advantage. It is the realization that
the newly discovered principle will provide spontaneous,
common-sense logic engendering
universal cooperation where, in many areas, only confusion
and controversy had hitherto
prevailed.

 Whether it was my thick eyeglasses and lack of other
personable favors, or
some other psychological factors, I often found myself
to be the number-one antifavorite
amongst my schoolteachers and pupils. When there were
disturbances in the classroom,
without looking up from his or her desk, the teacher
would say, "One mark," or "Two
marks," or "Three marks for Fuller." Each mark was a
fifteen-minute penalty period to be
served after the school had been let out for the others.
It was a sport amongst some of my
classmates to arrange, through projectiles or other
inventions, to have noises occur in my
vicinity.

 Where the teacher’s opinion of me was unfavorable,
and that, in the
humanities, was<SUP>&#95;&#95;</SUP>in the end<SUP>&#95;&#95;</SUP>all that governed the marking
of papers, I often found
myself receiving lower grades for reasons irrelevant
to the knowledge content of my
work<SUP>&#95;&#95;</SUP>such as my handwriting. In science, and particularly
in my mathematics, the
answers were either right or wrong. Probably to prove
to myself that I might not be as
low-average as was indicated by the gradings I got in
the humanities, I excelled in my
scientific classes and consistently attained the top
grades because all my answers were
correct. Maybe this made me like mathematics. But my
mathematics teachers in various
years would say, “You seem to understand math so well,
I’ll show you some more if you
stay in later in the afternoon.” I entered Harvard with
all As in mathematics, biology, and
the sciences, having learned in school advanced mathematics,
which at that time was
usually taught only at the college level. Since math
was so easy, and finding it optional
rather than compulsory at Harvard, I took no more of
its courses. I was not interested in
getting grades but in learning in areas that I didn't
know anything about. For instance, in
my freshman year, I took not only the compulsory English
A, but Government, Musical
Composition, Art Appreciation, German Literature, and
Chemistry. However, I kept
thinking all the time in mathematics and made progressive
discoveries, ever enlarging my
mathematical vistas. My elementary schoolwork in advanced
mathematics as well as in
physics and biology, along with my sense of security
in relating those fields, gave me great
confidence that I was penetrating the unfamiliar while
always employing the full gamut of
rigorous formulation and treatment appropriate to testing
the validity of intuitively
glimpsed and tentatively assumed enlargement of the
horizon of experientially
demonstrable knowledge.

 My spontaneous exploration of mathematics continued
after I left Harvard.
From 1915 to 1938<SUP>&#95;&#95;</SUP>that is, for more than twenty years
after my days in college<SUP>&#95;&#95;</SUP>I
assumed that what I had been discovering through the
postcollege years, and was
continuing to discover by myself, was well known to
mathematicians and other scientists,
and was only the well-known advanced knowledge to which
I would have been exposed
had I stayed at Harvard and majored in those subjects.
Why I did not continue at Harvard
is irrelevant to academics. A subsequent special course
at the U. S. Naval Academy,
Annapolis, and two years of private tutelage by some
of America's leading engineers of
half a century ago completed my formally acknowledged
“education.”

 In the twentieth year after college, I met Homer Lesourd,
my old physics
teacher, who most greatly inspired his students at my
school, Milton Academy, and who
for half a century taught mathematics at Harvard. We
discovered to our mutual surprise
that I had apparently progressed far afield from any
of the known physio-mathematical
concepts with which he was familiar or of which he had
any knowledge. Further inquiry by
both of us found no contradiction of our first conclusion.
That was a third of a century
ago. Thereafter, from time to time but with increasing
frequency, I found myself able to
elucidate my continuing explorations and discoveries
to other scientists, some of whom
were of great distinction. I would always ask them if
they were familiar with any
mathematical phenomena akin to the kind of disclosures
I was making, or if work was
being done by others that might lead to similar disclosures.
None of them was aware of
any other such disclosures or exploratory work. I always
asked them whether they thought
my disclosures warranted my further pursuit of what
was becoming an ever-increasingly
larger body of elegantly integrated and coordinate field
of omnirationally quantified
vectorial geometry and topology. While they could not
identify my discoveries with any of
the scientific fields with which they were familiar,
they found no error in my disclosures
and thought that the overall rational quantation and
their logical order of unfoldment
warranted my further pursuing the search.

 When one makes discoveries that, to the best of one’s
knowledge and wide
inquiry, seem to be utterly new, problems arise regarding
the appropriate nomenclature
and description of what is being discovered as well
as problems of invention relating to
symbolic economy and lucidity. As a consequence, I found
myself inventing an
increasingly larger descriptive vocabulary, which evolved
as the simplest, least ambiguous
method of recounting the paraphernalia and strategies
of the live scenario of all my
relevant experiences.

 For many years, my vocabulary was utterly foreign
to the semantics of all the
other sciences. I drew heavily on the dictionary for
good and unambiguous terms to
identify the multiplying nuances of my discoveries.
In the meanwhile, the whole field of
science was evolving rapidly in the new fields of quantum
mechanics, electronics, and
nuclear exploration, inducing a gradual evolution in
scientific language. In recent years, I
find my experiential mathematics vocabulary in a merging
traffic pattern with the language
trends of the other sciences, particularly physics.
Often, however, the particular new
words chosen by others would identify phenomena other
than that which I identify with
the same words. As the others were unaware of my offbeat
work, I had to determine for
myself which of the phenomena involved had most logical
claim to the names involved. I
always conceded to the other scientists, of course (unbeknownst
to them); when they
seemed to have prior or more valid claims, I would then
inventor select appropriate but
unused names for the phenomena I had discovered. But
I held to my own claim when I
found it to be eminently warranted or when the phenomena
of other claimants were ill
described by that term. For example, quantum mechanics
came many years after I did to
employ the term <I>spin.</I> The physicists assured me that
their use of the word did not involve
any phenomena that truly spun. <I>Spin</I> was only a convenient
word for accounting certain
unique energy behaviors and investments. My use of the
term was to describe a direct
observation of an experimentally demonstrable, inherent
spinnability and unique
magnitudes of rotation of an actually spinning phenomenon
whose next fractional
rotations were induced by the always co-occurring, generalized,
a priori, environmental
conditions within which the spinnable phenomenon occurred.
This was a case in which I
assumed that I held a better claim to the scientific
term <I>spin.</I> In recent years, spin is
beginning to be recognized by the physicists themselves
as also inadvertently identifying a
conceptually spinnable phenomenon<SUP>&#95;&#95;</SUP>in fact, the same
fundamental phenomenon I had
identified much earlier when I first chose to use the
word spin to describe that which was
experimentally disclosed as being inherently spinnable.
There appears to be an increasing
convergence of scientific explorations in general, and
of epistemology and semantics in
particular, with my own evolutionary development.

 Because physics has found no continuums, no experimental
solids, no things,
no real matter, I had decided half a century ago to
identify, mathematical behaviors of
energy phenomena only as <I>events.</I> If there are no things,
there are no nouns of material
substance. The old semantics permitted common-sense
acceptance of such a sentence as,
"A man pounds the table," wherein a noun verbs a noun
or a subject verbs a predicate. I
found it necessary to change this form to a complex
of events identified as me, which must
be identified as a verb. The complex verb me observed
another complex of events
identified again ignorantly as a "table." I disciplined
myself to communicate exclusively
with verbs. There are no <I>wheres</I> and <I>whats;</I> only angle
and frequency events described as
<I>whens.</I>

 In the competitive world of money-making, discoveries
are looked upon as
exploitable and monopolizable claims to be operated
as private properties of big business.
As a consequence, the world has come to think of both
discoveries and patents as
monopolized property. This popular viewpoint developed
during the last century, when
both corporations and government supported by courts
have required individuals working
for them to assign to them the patent rights on any
discoveries or inventions made while in
their employ. Employees were to assign these rights
during, and for two years after
termination of, their employment, whether or not the
invention had been developed at
home or at work. The drafting of expert patent claims
is an ever more specialized and
complex art, involving expensive legal services usually
beyond the reach of private
individuals. When nations were remote from one another,
internal country patents were
effective protection. With today's omniproximities of
the world's countries, only world-
around patents costing hundreds of thousands of dollars
are now effective, with the result
that patent properties are available only to rich corporations.

 So now the major portions of extant inventions belong
to corporations and
governments. However, invention and discovery are inherently
individual functions of the
minds of individual humans. Corporations are legal fabrications;
they cannot invent and
discover. Patents were originally conceived of as grants
to inventors to help them recover
the expenses of the long development of their discoveries;
and they gave the inventor only
a very short time to recover the expense. Because I
am concerned with finding new
technical ways of doing more with less, by which increasing
numbers of humanity can
emerge from abject poverty into states of physical advantage
in respect to their
environment, I have taken out many patent claims<SUP>&#95;&#95;</SUP>first,
to hold the credit of initiative for
the inspiration received by humanity's needs and the
theory of their best solution being that
of the design revolution and not political revolution,
and second, to try to recover the
expense of development. But most importantly, I have
taken the patents to avoid being
stopped by others<SUP>&#95;&#95;</SUP>in particular, corporations and governments<SUP>&#95;&#95;</SUP>from
doing what I felt
needed doing.

 What often seems to the individual to be an invention,
and seems also to be
an invention to everyone he knows, time and again turns
out to have been previously
discovered when patent applications are filed and the
search for prior patents begins.
Sometimes dozens, sometimes hundreds, of patents will
be found to have been issued, or
applied for, covering the same idea. This simultaneity
of inventing manifests a forward-
rolling wave of logical exploration of which the trends
are generated by the omni-
integrating discoveries and the subsequent inventions
of new ways to employ the
discoveries at an accelerating rate, which is continually
changing the metaphysical
environment of exploratory and inventive stimulation.

 I have learned by experience that those who think
only in competitive ways
assume that I will be discouraged to find that others
have already discovered, invented,
and patented that which I had thought to be my own unique
discovery or invention. They
do not understand how pleased I am to learn that the
task I had thought needed doing, and
of which I had no knowledge of others doing, was happily
already being well attended to,
for my spontaneous commitment is to the advantage of
all humanity. News of such work
of others frees me to operate in other seemingly unattended
but needed directions of
effort. And I have learned how to find out more about
what is or is not being attended to.
This is evolution.

 When I witness the inertias and fears of humans caused
by technical
breakthroughs in the realms of abstract scientific discovery.
I realize that their criteria of
apprehension are all uninformed. I see the same patterns
of my experience obtaining
amongst the millions of scientists around the world
silently at work in the realm of
scientific abstract discovery, often operating remote
from one another. Many are bound to
come out with simultaneous discoveries, each one of
which is liable to make the others a
little more comprehensible and usable. Those who have
paid-servant complexes worry
about losing their jobs if their competitors' similar
discoveries become known to their
employers. But the work of pure science exploration
is much less understood by the
economically competitive-minded than is that of inventors.
The great awards economic
competitors give to the scientists make big news, but
no great scientist ever did what he
did in hope of earning rewards. The greats have ever
been inspired by the a priori
integrities of Universe and by the need of all humanity
to move from the absolute
ignorance of birth into a little greater understanding
of the cosmic integrities. They esteem
the esteem of those whom they esteem for similar commitment,
but they don't work for it.

 I recall now that when I first started making mathematical
discoveries, years
ago, my acquaintances would often say, "Didn't you know
that Democritus made that
discovery and said just what you are saying 2,000 years
ago?" I replied that I was lucky
that I didn't know that because I thought Democritus
so competent that I would have
given up all my own efforts to understand the phenomena
involved through my own
faculties and investment of time. Rather than feeling
dismayed, I was elated to discover
that, operating on my own, I was able to come out with
the same conclusions of so great a
mind as that of Democritus. Such events increased my
confidence in the resourcefulness
and integrity of human thought purely pursued and based
on personal experiences.

 I know that many of the discoveries of synergetics
in the book of their
accounting, which follows, may prove in time to be well-known
to others. But some of
them may not be known to others and thus may be added
to the ever-increasing insights of
the human mind. Any one individual has inherently limited
knowledge of what total
Universe frontiering consists of at any one moment.
My list embraces what I know to be
my own discoveries of which I have no knowledge of others
having made similar
discoveries earlier than my own. I claim nothing. Proofs
of some of my theoretical
discoveries have been made by myself and will be made
by myself. Proofs may have been
made by others and will be made by others. Proofs are
satisfying. But many mathematical
theorems provide great living advantages for humanity
over long periods of time before
their final mathematical proofs are discovered. The
whys and wherefores of what is rated
as mathematical proof have been evolved by mathematicians;
they are formal and esoteric
conventions between specialists.

cosmically unique aspects of vertexes, faces, and edges.
Synergetics adds (1) angles, (2)
irrelevant untuned insideness and outsideness, (3) convexity
and concavity, and (4) axis of
spin, making a total of seven topological aspects (see
Sec. <A HREF="../s10/p3363.html#1044.00">1044.00</A>);

perceptivity, whose maximum terrestrial range is the
horizon. Beyond the horizon the
distances between remote objects are reduced to optically
nontunable angle-size or -
frequency discernibility. Ergo, at the maximum tunability
of differential-wavelength-
perceptivity, our range-finding optical system produces
a false image of a seemingly
convergent pair of parallel railroad tracks. It is not
that the tracks or the ties are coming

 Though the diameter of Betelguese in Orion’s Belt
is greater than the
diameter of the planet Earth’s orbit around the Sun,
Betelguese appears to Earthians only
as a fine point of light. As in the rate of information
recall by the mind from brain storage,
there is also an inherent lag in the rate human optical
equipment can apprehend newly
perceived phenomena. The pulsative frequency of alternating
current electric light is 60
cycles per second, which is designed to coincide with
the frequency corresponding to
humans’ “second look” stroboscopic rate of apprehending.
In a like manner the frequency
rate of the cinema's picture-frame running is synchronized
to coincide with the human rate
of mental-mouthful digestibility of new information
receptivity, which must check the new
information with the old to permit recognition or new
cognition. The static frames

 The <I>XYZ</I>-rectilinear coordinate system of humans fails
to accommodate any
finite resolution of any physically experienced challenge
to comprehension. Physical
experience demonstrates that individual-unit wavelength
or frequency events close-pack in
spherical agglomerations of unit radius spheres. Two
unit-radius spheres in tangency
provide a seemingly linear pattern, but a third closest-packed
sphere nests in the valley of
the first two and produces triangulation. In equilateral
triangular growth of closest-planar-
packed unit-radius spheres the triangle’s edges are
never parallel. As human experience
increases<SUP>&#95;&#95;</SUP>event by event<SUP>&#95;&#95;</SUP>the number of experience spheres
along the faraway edge of
the triangle of individual observations also increases.
Each successive row of closest-
packed spheres away from the observer always increases
by one event. While the rows are
parallel to one another, the outermost row can be taken
perpendicularly away from the
master triangle and from any one of its sides without
disturbing the integrity of
equiangular symmetry. This progression of symmetrical
shrinkage of the triangle is a
property completely different from that of the square,
wherein the removal of any one
outer most parallel row of closest-packed cubes from
any of the four sides leaves a
nonsquare, nonequiedged rectangle.

nature operates in convergent-divergent, associative-disassociative

Synergetically, nature is both expansively radiant and

radiation<SUP>&#95;&#95;</SUP>an expansive, disintegrative, ever more disorderly
coming apart<SUP>&#95;&#95;</SUP>or nature as

 The synergetic coordinate system of nature and its

turnaround-limited hierarchy of primitive ascending

omnisymmetrically concentric, polyhedral components
provides the human mind with a
rational means of resolving problems by bringing nature
into a corner<SUP>&#95;&#95;</SUP>a convergent
terminus center, a four-dimensional corner of the four-dimensional
planes of the
tetrahedron. Only with the four-dimensional convergence
and divergence of synergetics
can the human mind reduce problems to comprehension
as minimum-limit systems. The
minimum polygon is a triangle; the minimum polyhedron
is a tetrahedron; both of their

 Two identical sets of 10 spheres in closest packing
precess in 90-degree
action to form a prime, nonnucleated, four-ball-to-the-edge
tetrahedron with a total of 20
spheres. Each of the two sets of 10 balls consists of
a line of four balls arranged in a
tangentially cohered row nested in the long valley of
a rectangle consisting of three pairs
of balls tangentially cohered to one another in a parallel
array, with two balls on one end
and three balls on the other end. Cohering the four-ball
row tangentially to the valley of
the six-ball quadrangle produces a 10-ball aggregate.
When brought together, these two
10-ball assemblies produce the prime, four-ball-edge
tetrahedron of 20 balls, the largest
single-shell tetrahedron without a nuclear ball. (This
20-ball tetrahedron is at the heart of
the tetrahedral assembly of 120 balls comprised of two
sets of 60 closest-packed
spheres<SUP>&#95;&#95;</SUP>see Sec. <A HREF="../s04/p1600.html#417.00">417.00</A>.)
To bring them into tetrahedral
symmetry of assembly, each four-
ball edge of the two separate assemblies must be precessed
(turned at right angles) to the
other's four-ball edge. In these conditions the two-ball
edges of the six-ball rectangle are
now addressing the three-ball edges of the other quadrangle.
To the trained eye and
rationale of rectilinear coordination it seems illogical
to address two balls to three balls or
three balls to two balls. In matching such assemblies
people think of doing so only in
parallels or perpendiculars.

 In universally convergent-divergent coordinate growth
or shrinking, each
row is greater (or lesser) by one than the next. Three
automatically goes to two in a
convergent, planar-arrayed, structurally stable system
and two automatically goes to three
in a divergent, planar-arrayed, structurally stable
system. Tetrahedral expansion or
contraction produces a structurally stable systematic
model of universal behavior. In
tetrahedral growth one goes to three and three goes
to six and six goes to 10 (see Sec.

 Getting nature into a corner is the essence of synergetics'
exploratory
strategy. Synergetics is the coordination of thought
and physical action, the genesis of
geometry, system, and structure. Physics and metaphysics
are resonantly integral: the
integrity of their intertransformative mathematics into
all the special case, variably
enduring associabilities cognized by humans as structural
design. The frequency rates are
the separate, static frame rates of inspection and are
recognized by humans' brains as
mechanics when the frequency of inspection by humans
synchronizes with the cinema
frames' running. The difference between structures and
machinery is the same as the
difference between "moving" and "static" pictures as
both relate to human information
comprehending. This is the grand strategy.

"areas" are only windows in polyhedrally conceptual
systems. You look out the window at
the nothingness of undimensional night<SUP>&#95;&#95;</SUP>or of fog. The
"faces" of presynergetics topology
packaged the undimensionable nothingness into arbitrary
somethingness, which thus
misassumed the dimensions of the face windows and their
closed-circuit edges to
constitute dimensional attributes of the undimensional
nothingness so framed.
Academically misinformed teachers go to the blackboard,
drawing a "square," and saying
to the students, "A square is an area bound by a closed
line of four equal-length edges and
four equiangled corners," without paying any attention
to the inherently existent
complementations of Universe. To start off with, the
phenomenon "square" is dependent
on the phenomenon "blackboard," whose structural matrix
alone maintained the
symmetrical shape of the nonstructurally stabilized
pattern of the square. (Compare Sec.
<A HREF="../s06/p1300.html#617.04">617.04</A>.)
The closed-line pattern of the square inadvertently
subdivides the whole surface
of the polyhedral blackboard into two areas, both bound
by the closed line of four equal
edges and four equal angles. The four equal edges of
the large complementary square are
the same length as those of the small square; the big
square's corners are each 270
degrees, while the small square’s corners are each 90
degrees. (Compare Sec. <A HREF="../s08/p0000.html#810.00">810</A>.)
Moreover, the drawing of the square also inadvertently
subdivides the insideness and
outsideness of the blackboard into concave and convex
big and little squares; it also
deposits part of the Universe as "chalk" atoms onto
the blackboard’s agglomeration of
atoms, which inadvertently rearranges the chemical element
resources of Scenario
Universe.

 In the layer-around-layer, symmetrical closest packing
of unit radius spheres
around a nuclear sphere of the same radius, the number

develop a microscope. The point
seemed to be the terminal, smallest visual experience.
The visual smallest was smaller than

 Similarly, the concept of spatial nothingness is pretelescopic,
established
eons before anyone knew that humans might develop a
telescope. Now that humans have
acquired discretely measured knowledge regarding the
speed and other behavioral
characteristics of all radiation, including the refraction
of light, and have developed the
science of optics and the chemistry of light-sensitive
emulsions for phototelescopy, they
have discovered a macrocosm of billions of galaxies
consisting of an average of 100 billion
stars each; 99.9999 percent of these progressively outwardly
considered, discovered
phenomena are invisible to the naked human eye. In the
opposed or inwardly considered
experience field the physicists have discovered and
measured the unique frequency
characteristics of each of the chemical elements together
with frequency characteristics
and other energetic characteristics of atomic components.
Physicists employing the same
radiation-sensitive emulsion photography<SUP>&#95;&#95;</SUP>first through
the human-spectrum-range
microscope, subsequently through the scanning electron
microscope, and after that
through the field emission microscope<SUP>&#95;&#95;</SUP>have photographed
individual atoms. In this
inwardly and diminishing magnitude progression humans
have photographically harvested
knowledge of physical reality that is 99.9999 percent
infra- or subvisible to humans,
meaning untunable within the very limited electromagnetic
frequency range of the human
senses’ crystal-equipped radio sets. The exponential,
fourth-power, historical acceleration
rate of these outwardly exploding and inwardly permeating
human cognitive events has
become too sudden for societal digestion and recognition
of the significance of what
seemed to be <I>terminal</I> yesterday. The reality of the
<I>point</I> and the <I>space</I> have been
variously conceptualized in the purely theoretical and
physically unexperienceable

 Man suddenly got to thinking of the atom as the terminal,
the conceptual
minimum. He had the terminal case of the atom as a point,
but then later found that the
atoms consisted of at minimum a proton, a neutron, an
electron, and an atomic nucleus,
and so forth. And so for a while the atomic nucleus
was the terminal limit, until humans
began smashing the atom and breaking the nucleus into
new component particles: Thus
the quarks became the most recently apparent terminally
smallest limits of considerability.
But the characteristics of the quarks are very exciting
because they, too, incontrovertibly
manifest a complex of a plurality of interdependent
and numerically consistent behaviors.
So what physics is really discovering is primitive <I>system
conceptuality</I> independent of time
and size. And in synergetics conceptuality independent
of time and size discloses a
complex hierarchy of nuclear system intertransformabilities
with low-order numerical and
topological relationships, a complex of interrelationships
consistently characterizing every
one of their realizations as special case, experimentally
demonstrable, sense-tuned,
physical reality.

 Our brains are physical tuning capabilities consisting
of uniquely resonant
atoms and cells. Apprehension consists of resonant atoms
tuning into congruently resonant
atoms. There is a cosmic meshingness; an angle-and-frequency
congruence similar to that
of mechanical gear trains when the number of teeth per
circular perimeter and the angular
modulation of the valleys and peaks of the individual
teeth of the larger, smaller, or unit
radius gears must mesh with minimally tolerated aberrational
error; wherein the
aberrations of metallic gears must be compensatingly
interfilled with lubricants that
prevent the aberrations of one part from reaching the
aberrations of the reciprocating part.
In much modern machinery nylon and other plastic gears
have provided interyieldability,
obviating the use of lubricants. Such yielding is demonstrably
employed by nature in the
hydraulic-pneumatic, crystalline structuring of all
biological organisms. (See Sections

 At minimum, life involves awareness, self involves
otherness, and otherness
involves somethingness. Awareness is of otherness: awareness
of the outside superficiality
of the observer’s “finger” by the externality-searching
optical system of the observer.
Indeed, the externality-searching for the nipple of
its mother’s breast by the olfactorily
guided external nose-mouth of the newborn constitutes
initial otherness awareness. As a
fertilized ovum of an integrally evolving female organism
umbilically circuited with the
female organism, no otherness awareness is involved
except that of the mother even as she

 Otherness involves somethingness; This brings us to
reconsideration of the
nature of epistemological evolution and of the gradual
transition in degrees of relative
adequacy of macroscale of human comprehending and in
microscale of definitive
exactitude in interpreting what is being humanly experienced.
Humans were included in
the cosmic system's design to fulfill critical functions
in respect to maintenance of the
integrity of eternally regenerative Scenario Universe.
To arrive full-blown and functioning
in its cosmic role, humanity has been given the capability
to inventory its tactical resources
progressively and to reorient its functioning from an

 At one early historical moment in that epistemological
evolution humans
evolved the mathematical concept of dimensionless points,
lines, and planes. Their
dimensionless lines and planes were aggregates of the
dimensionless points, yet these self-
contradictory concepts have persisted in the children's
school curricula of today, despite
the fact that they were adopted long before humans had
even dreamed of optical
magnifying lenses, let alone electron microscopes. The
philosophy that adopted such
nonoperational educational devices was predicated<SUP>&#95;&#95;</SUP>they
said<SUP>&#95;&#95;</SUP>upon "purely imaginary

the ultratunable is ultra to
both external and internal experiences of human record.
The ultratunable nothingness
persists where the electromagnetic wavelengths involved
are greater than the span of all
humanly remembered experiences; wherefore the last time
such a phenomenon occurred
was prior to human experience recording, the next time
its wave is to peak is

 The operational self-discovery of any given conceptually
periodic frequency
is predicated upon a minimum experience quota of four
successively experienced, similar
events. This is because the three original time intervals
between four angularly finite

necessary to establish the

interval repetition between
what seem to be similar events. The first interval between

recurrence<SUP>&#95;&#95;</SUP>seemed to be only

 The ability of humans to tune in information is dependent
on their being
initially equipped with limited-range tuning apparatus,
such as that of seeing, hearing,
touching, smelling; human tunability is also dependent
upon the special case data of
experience stored in their recallable brain banks, the
interrelatedness of which is only
intuitively apprehended at first and later is experimentally
reconfirmed, but comprehended
only by human minds. Infra or ultratunability at any
one moment of human experience
neither precludes nor promises<SUP>&#95;&#95;</SUP>but can suggest to intuition<SUP>&#95;&#95;</SUP>the

tunability to be developed by humans to occur beyond

at-minimum-twoness of the observer provide the initial
four-dimensional foci of a
tetrasystem. Otherness as a noise always has a direction
relative to both the vertical human
observer's head-to-heel axis and the horizontal axis
of any pair of the human's two nostrils,
ears, eyes, hands, and arms. The two polar terminals
of the vertical axis derive from the
initial head-to-heel axis of the observer. The diametric
axis is generated subsequently and
spun horizontally and cirumferentially in the observational
plane of any two of its
terminally sensing facilities. The two polar terminals
of the head-to-heel axis and any two
of the sensing terminals of the diametric observational
axis are intertriangularly
connectable to produce the six interrelationships of
the inherent systemic tetrahedron of
the observer system. The interim orbital repositioning
of the observer system totality
during the spin cycle inherently occasions the occurrence
of the diametric axis in a plane
always other than that in which the original axis of
spinnability had occurred.

 Special case is angularly referenced to the inherent
twoness of the polar axis
of the system doing the observing, because the observer
is a system and the system is four-
dimensional. The fact that unity is two
(Sec. <A HREF="../s05/p1000.html#513.03">513.03</A>)
means that an observer is at
minimum two, but realistically four, because the observer
is a system; and the observed is
at minimum two, but being a system, is realistically
four. A range-finder is inherently
tetrahedral.

 The sensing apparatus and the action apparatus with
which humans are
integrally equipped are both designed to provide them
with angular orientation and the
triangulated observation of distance. The two ears,
two eyes, two nostrils, two arms, and
two legs all produce triangulated distance-to-object
information. They are range-finders.
Using the distance between any pair of their integral
sensing instruments as the baseline of
a triangle whose opposite vertex is marked by the external
object they are viewing,
touching, hearing, or smelling, they sense the relative
magnitude of the angles at the
sensing ends of the baseline<SUP>&#95;&#95;</SUP>which gives them the sense
of magnitude of the
complementary third angle at the apex of the triangle
where the sensed object is located.
Range-finding is triangulation. Sensing is triangulation.

 Conditioned to linear, special-case-directions thinking
by the formally
adopted educational systems of world-around society,
humans think of life as a continuous
linear experience despite all experiencing being inherently
omnidirectionally informed. But
they fail to consider that for every two eighthour periods
of seemingly continuous
consciousness they stop conscious experiencing for eight
hours<SUP>&#95;&#95;</SUP>two on and two
off<SUP>&#95;&#95;</SUP>two on and two off. And they fail to realize that
their sight is stroboscopically
discontinuous and that there are inherent lags between
sightings and cognitions, with the
intervals between sights and cognitions too short to
be cerebrally tunable. Here again we
have evidence of the omnidirectional, finitely islanded,
closed-system moments of
awareness, which moments alone can be identified with
what we call life. Here we have
infratunable discontinuity of life occurring 60 times
every second and tunably
discontinuing for eight hours every 16 hours<SUP>&#95;&#95;</SUP>with no
human ever having the capability to
prove that he is the same human who went to sleep nor
that what he calls being awake is

Tune-in-ability and tune-out-ability
systems function as transceivers. Tune-out-ability is
omnidirectional transmission: it does
not mean shut off, as does "turning out the light."
