 <B> Definition:</B> The number of vertexes of every omnitriangulated
structural
system is rationally and differentially accountable,
first, by selecting and separating out the
always <I>additive two</I> polar vertexes that must accommodate
the neutral axis of spin
inherent in all individual structural systems to permit
and account for their independent
motional freedom relationship from the rest of Universe.
The number of nonpolar vertexes
is called the base number. Second, we identify the always
<I>multiplicative</I> duality factor of
<I>two</I> characterizing the always coexistent insideness-outsideness
of systems and their
inherently positively and negatively congruent disparity
of convexity and concavity. Third,
we find the multiplicative duality factor of two to
be multiplied by one of the first four
prime numbers, 1, 2, 3, or 5 (multiplied by 1 if the
structural system is tetrahedral, by 2 if it
is octahedral, by 3 if it is the triangularly structured
cube, or by 5 if it is the icosahedron or
the triangularly stabilized vector equilibrium), or
factored by a variety of multiples
comprised of combinations of only those first four prime
numbers, whether the polyhedra
are, in the Platonic, Archimedean, or any other progression
of symmetrical structural
systems. When the vector edges of the symmetrical systems
are modularly subdivided, all
of the foregoing products are found to be multiplied
again to the second power by the
frequency of uniform modular subdivisions of the vector
edges of the symmetrical
structural system. In respect to the original base number
of nonpolar vertexes, there will
always be twice as many openings ("faces") and three
times as many vector edges of the
symmetrical structural system, always remembering that
the two polar vertexes were first
extracted from the inventory of topological characteristics
before multiplying the
remaining number of vertexes in the manner described
and in relation to which the number
of nonpolar vertexes and the relative abundance of the
other topological characteristics are
accurately derived and operationally described.

 <B>Axis of Spin:</B> Any two vertexes may be selected as
the axis of spin, whether
or not the axis described by them is immediately conceivable
as the logical axis of
spinnability, i.e., the axis need not be statically
symmetrical. (You can take hold of a boy
by his two hands and, holding one above the other and
leaning backward spin him
centrifugally around you. Although his two hands do
not represent the symmetrical static
axis of the boy’s body, their dynamic positions defined
the axis of your mutual spinning.)

twoness of local precessional system effects at 90 degrees,
and (2) the Universe-cohering
gravitational effects at 180 degrees. These are the

regenerate the scientific
generalization known as complementarity. Complementarity
is sum-totally eightfoldedly
operative: four definitive local system complementations

convex-outsideness of all systems: these four are the

 The <I>additive</I> twoness derives from the polar vertexes
of the neutral axis of
spin of all systems. This twoness is the beginning and
essence of consciousness, with
which human awareness begins: consciousness of the other,
the other experience, the
other being, the child's mother. To describe that of
which we are aware, we employ
comparison to previous experience. That which we are
aware of is hotter, or bigger, or
sharper than the other experience or experiences. The
a priori otherness of comparative
awareness inherently requires time. Early humanity's
concept of the minimum increment of
time was the <I>second</I>, because time and awareness <I>begin</I>
with the second experience, the
prime <I>other</I>. If there is only one think, one think is
naught. Life and Universe that goes
with it begins with two spheres: you and me . . . and
you are always prior to me. I have
just become by my awareness of you.

 The <I>multiplicative</I> twoness is inherent in the disparity
of the congruent
convexity and concavity of the system. The multiplicative
twoness is because both you and

concave.

 Conceptual systems having inherent insideness and
outsideness are defined at
minimum by four event foci and are, ergo, tetrahedral;
at maximum symmetrical
complexity, they are superficially "spherical"<SUP>&#95;&#95;</SUP>that
is, they are a spherelike array of event
foci too minute for casual resolution into the plurality
of individual event foci of which, in
experiential fact, they must consist, each being approximately
equidistant from one
approximately identifiable event focus at the spherical
array's center. Since all the
"surface" event foci may be triangularly interconnected
with one another by chords that
are shorter than arcs, all spherical experience arrays
are, in fact, polyhedra. And all spheres
are polyhedra. Spherical polyhedra may at minimum consist
of the four vertexes of the
regular tetrahedron.

 We discover that the additive twoness of the two polar
(and a priori
awareness) spheres at most economical minimum definition
of event foci are two
congruent tetrahedra, and that the insideness and outsideness
of complementary tetrahedra
altogether represent the two invisible complementary
twoness that balances the visible
twoness of the polar pair. This insideouting tetrahedron
is the minimum compound

 <B> Symmetrical Analysis of Topological Hierarchies:</B> Whenever
we refer to
an entity, it has to be structurally valid, and therefore
it has to be triangulated. Being
locally mixed, vectorially symmetrical but facially
asymmetrical, being triangulated but not
omnitriangulated, vector equilibrium may function as
a system but not as a structure.

 <B> Powering:</B> Second powering in the topology of synergetics
is identifiable
only with the vertexes of the system and not with something
called the "surface area."
Surfaces imply experimentally nondemonstrable continuums.
There are no topologically
indicated or implied <I>surfaces</I> or <I>solids</I>. The vertexes
are the external points of the system.
The higher the frequency of the system, the denser the
number of external points. We
discover then that second powering does not refer to
"squaring" or to surface
amplification. Second powering refers to the number
of the system's external vertexes in
which equating the second power and the radial or circumferential
modular subdivisions of
the system multiplied by the prime number <I>one</I> if a tetrahedral
system; by the prime
number <I>two</I> if an octahedral system; by the prime number
<I>three</I> if a triangulated cubical
system; and by the prime number <I>five</I> if an icosahedral
system; each, multiplied by two,
and added to by two, will accurately predict the number
of superficial points of the system.

 This principle eliminates our dilemma of having to
think of <I>second</I> and <I>third</I>
powers of systems as referring exclusively to continuum
<I>surfaces</I> or <I>solids</I> of the systems,
neither of which states have been evidenced by experimental
science. The frequencies of
systems modify their prime rational integer characteristics.
The second power and third
power point aggregations identify the energy quanta
of systems and their radiational
growth or their gravitational contraction. They eliminate
the dilemma in which physics
failed to identify simultaneously the wave and the particle.
The dilemma grew from the
misconceived necessity to identify omnidirectional wave
growth exclusively with the rate
of a nonexperimentally existent spherical surface continuum
growth, the second power of
radiational growth being in fact the exterior quanta
and not the spherical surface being
considered as a continuum.

 Max Planck's photons of light are separately packaged
at the radiation
source and travel in a group-coordinated flight formation
spherical surface pattern which
is ever expanding outwardly as they gradually separate
from one another. Every photon
always travels radially away from the common origin.
This group-developed pattern
produces a sum-totally expanding spherical wave-surface
determined by the plurality of
outwardly traveling photons, although any single photon
travels linearly outwardly in only
one radial direction. This total energy effort is exactly
expressed in terms of the
exponential second-power, or areal "squaring," rate
of surface growth of the overall
spherical wave; i.e., as the second power of the energy
effort expended in lifting one gram
in each second of time a distance of one "vertical"
centimeter radially outward away from
the origin center.

 In synergetics' topological accounting, surface areas
are always structural
triangles of the systems, which systems, being vectorially
structured, are inherently energy-
investment systems. As synergetics' topology also shows,
the number of triangular surface
areas of the system increases at twice the rate of the
nonpolar surface points, ergo the rate
of energetic system’s surface increase is accounted
in terms of the number of the triangular
areas of the system's surface, which rate of system
surface increase is 20F<SUP>2</SUP>, where F =
frequency; while the rate of volumetric increase is
20F<SUP>3</SUP>. The vector is inherent in the
synergetics system since it is structured with the vector
as unity. Because vectors = mass &#215;
velocity, all the factors of time, distance, and energy,
as both mass and effort as well as
angular direction, are inherent; and <I>E</I> as energy quantum
of one photon = 20F<SUP>2</SUP>.

 I recognize the experimentally derived validity of
the <I>coordinate invariant</I>
the result does not depend on the coordinate system
used. Planck's constant is just what it
says it is: an experimentally ascertained constant cosmic
relationship. Planck's constant as
expressed is inherently an irrational number, and the
irrationality relates to the invariant
quantum of energy being constantly expressed exclusively
in the volume-weight terms of a
special-case <I>shape</I> which, in the geometrical shape-variant
field of weight-strength and
surface-volume ratio limits of local structural science
containment of energy, as mass or
effort, by energy-as-structure, is neither maximum nor
minimum. The special-case
geometrical shape chosen arbitrarily by the engineering-structures-eschewing
pure
scientists for their energy-measurement accommodation,
that of the cube, is structurally
unstable; so much so as to be too unstable to be classified
as a structure. Unwitting of this
mensural shortcoming, Planck's constant inadvertently
refers to the cube, implicit to the
gram, as originally adopted to provide an integrated
unit of weight-to-volume
mensuration, as was the “knot” adopted by navigators
as a velocity unit which integrates
time-space incrementation values. The volume and weight
integrate as a gram. The gram
was arbitrarily assumed to be constituted by a cubic
centimeter of water at a specific
temperature, 4 degrees centigrade.

 Relationship constants are always predicated on limits.
Only limits are
invariable. (This is the very essence of the calculus.)
Variation is between limits. Though
Planck's constant is indirectly predicated on a limit
condition of physical phenomena, it is
directly expressed numerically only as a prefabricated,
constantly irrational number-
proportionality to that limit, but it is not the inherently
rational unit number of that limit
condition. This is because the cube was nonstructural
as well as occurring structurally

 Max Planck found a constant energy-value relationship
emergent in all the
photon-discovery experimental work of others. A great
variety of exploratory work with
measurements of energy behaviors in the field of radiation
disclosed a hitherto unexpected,
but persistent, minimum limit in relation to such energy
phenomena. Planck expressed the
constant, or limit condition, in the scientifically
prevailing numerical terms of the physical
and metaphysical equipment used to make the measuring.
The measuring system included:

<LI>the decimal system;
<LI>the CG<SUB>t</SUB>S and;

 Let us assume hypothetically that Ponce de Leon did
find the well of eternal-
youth-sustaining water, and that the well had no "spring"
to replenish it, and that social
demand occasioned its being bailed out and poured into
evaporation-proof containers; and
that the scientists who bailed out that precious well
of water used a cubically-shaped, fine-
tolerance, machined and dimensioned one-inch-thick shelled,
stainless steel bucket to do
their carefully measured bailing and conserving task.
They did so because they knew that
cubes close-pack to fill allspace, and because water
is a constant substance with a given
weight per volume at a given temperature. And having
ten fingers each, they decided to
enumerate in the metric system without any evidence
that meters are whole rational linear
increments of a cosmic nature. Thus organized, the Ponce

exhausted the well, after taking out only six and two-thirds
cubic bucket loads<SUP>&#95;&#95;</SUP>with a
little infinitely unaccountable, plus-or-minus, spillage

 Planck's constant, <I>h</I>, denotes the minimum energy-as-radiation
increment
known experimentally by humans to be employed by nature,
but the photon's energy value
could and should be expressed in terms of a whole number
as referenced directly by
physical experiment to nature's limit-case transforming
states.

 Had, for instance, the well-of-youth-measuring scientists
happened to be in a
hurry and had they impatiently used a cubical container
of the same size made of a thin-
wall plastic such as the cubically shaped motel waste
containers, they would have noticed
when they stood their waterfilled plastic cube bucket
on the ground beside the well that its
sides bulged and that the level of the water lowered
perceptibly below the container's rim;
though this clearly was not caused by leaking, nor by
evaporating, but because its shape
was changing, and because its volume-to-container-surface
ratio was changing.

 Of all regular polyhedra, the sphere (i.e., the high-frequency,
omnitriangulated, geodesic, spheroidal polyhedron) encloses
the most volume with the
least surface. Whereas the tetrahedron encloses the
least volume with the most surface.
The contained energy is at minimum in the tetrahedron.
The structure capability is at
maximum in the tetrahedron.

 Planck did not deliberately start with the cube. He
found empirically that the
amount of the photon's energy could be expressed in
terms of the CG<SUB>t</SUB>S-XYZ decimal-
enumeration coordinate system already employed by science
as the "frame of reference"<SUP>3</SUP>
for his photon evaluation which, all inadvertently,
was characterized by awkwardness and
irrationality.

 Energy has shape. Energy transforms and trans-shapes
in an evoluting way.
Planck's contemporary scientists were not paying any
attention to that. Science has been
thinking shapelessly. The predicament occurred that
way. It's not the size of the
bucket<SUP>&#95;&#95;</SUP>size is special case<SUP>&#95;&#95;</SUP>they had the wrong shape.
If they had had the right shape,
they would have found a whole-rational-number constant.
And if the whole number found
was greater than unity, or a rational fraction of unity,
they would simply have had to
divide or multiply to find unity itself.

 The multiplier 10<SUP>-27</SUP> is required to reduce the centimeter
magnitude of
energy accounting to that of the tuned wavelength of
the photon reception. Frequency and
wave are covariably coupled; detection of one discloses
the other. Since synergetics'
vector equilibrium's energy converging or dispersing
vector is both radially and chordally
subdivided evenly by frequency<SUP>&#95;&#95;</SUP>whatever that frequency
may be<SUP>&#95;&#95;</SUP>the frequency
fractionates the unit vector energy involvement by one-to-one
correspondence.

 If they had taken the same amount of water at the
same temperature in the
form of a regular tetrahedron, they would have come
out with a rational fraction of unity.
They happened to be enumerating with congruence in modulo
10, which does not include
any prime numbers other than 1, 2, and 5. The rational
three-ness of the cube in relation to
the tetrahedron is not accommodated by the decimal system;
nor is the prime 7 inherent in
modulo 10. Therefore, Planck's constant, while identifying
a hitherto undiscovered
invariant limit condition of nature, was described in
the wrong frame of reference in
awkward<SUP>&#95;&#95;</SUP>albeit in a constantly awkward<SUP>&#95;&#95;</SUP>term, which works,
because it is the truth; but
at the same time it befogs the otherwise lucid and rational
simplicity covering this
phenomenon of nature, just as does nature's whole number
of utterly rational atoms
exchanging rates in all her chemical combining and separating
transactions accounting.
