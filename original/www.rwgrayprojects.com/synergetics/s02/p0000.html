 Synergetics promulgates a system of mensuration employing
60-degree vectorial coordination comprehensive to both

 Synergetics originates in the assumption that dimension
must be physical; that conceptuality is metaphysical
and independent of size; and that a triangle is a triangle
independent of size.

 Since physical Universe is entirely energetic, all
dimension must be energetic. Synergetics is energetic
geometry since it identifies energy with number. Energetic
geometry employs 60-degree coordination because that
is nature's way to closest-pack spheres.

 Synergetics shows how we may measure our experiences
geometrically and topologically and how we may employ
geometry and topology to coordinate all information
regarding our experiences, both metaphysical and physical.
Information can be 
either conceptually metaphysical or quantitatively special
case physical experiencing, or it can be both. The
quantized physical case is entropic, while the metaphysical
generalized conceptioning induced by the generalized
content of the information is 
syntropic. The resulting mind-appreciated syntropy evolves
to anticipatorily terminate the entropically accelerated
disorder.

 The mathematics involved in synergetics consists of
topology combined with vectorial geometry. Synergetics
derives from experientially invoked mathematics. Experientially
invoked mathematics shows how we may measure and coordinate
omnirationally, energetically, arithmetically, geometrically,
chemically, volumetrically, crystallographically, vectorially,
topologically, and energy-quantum-wise in terms of
the tetrahedron.

 Although we are deeply and inescapably aware of the
vast ranges of unexploited geometry, we must not permit
such preoccupations to obscure our awareness of the
generalized, comprehensively coordinate, arithmetical,
geometrical, and factorial
system employed by nature in all her energetic-synergetic
transformative transactions. With the general systems'
discovery of the tetrahedron as the basic structural
unit of physical Universe quantation, we find that
there is a fundamental hierarchy of
vectorial-geometric relationships that coincides with
and integrates topology, quantum mechanics, and chemistry.

 Synergetics is a triangular and tetrahedral system.
It uses 60-degree coordination instead of 90-degree
coordination. It permits conceptual modeling of the
fourth and fifth arithmetic powers; that is, fourth-
and fifth-dimensional aggregations
of points or spheres in an entirely rational coordinate
system that is congruent with all the experientially
harvested data of astrophysics and molecular physics;
that is, both macro- and micro-cosmic phenomena. It
coordinates within one mensurational
system the complete gears-interlocking of quantum
wave mechanics and vectorial geometry.

 Synergetics explains much that has not been previously

 Rather than refuting the bases of presently known
Euclidean and non-Euclidean and hyperbolic and elliptic
geometry, synergetics identifies the alternate freedoms
of prime axiomatic assumption from which the present
mathematical bases were
selected. It embraces all the known mathematics. All
of the axiomatic alternatives are logical. Thus, original
assumptions eliminate the necessity for subsequent
assignment of physical qualities to nonconceptual mathematical
devices. Classical mathematics
has, of necessity, assigned progressively discovered
attributes of physical Universe to irrational relationships
with the ghostly, a priori Greek geometry. The quest
for a mathematics expressing nature's own design has
been an elusive one. Synergetics 
has developed as the search for the omnirational, comprehensive,
coordinate system employed by nature, i.e., Universe,
throughout all its complementary and interaccommodatively
transforming transactions.

Synergetics altogether forsakes
axioms as "self-evident," premicroscope, superficial
beliefs. It predicates all its relationship explorations
on the most accurately and comprehensively statable
observations regarding direct experiences.
The new set of data employed by synergetics seemingly
results in sublimely facile expression of hitherto
complex relationships. It makes nuclear physics a conceptual
facility comprehensible to any physically normal child.

 Synergetics makes possible the return to omniconceptual
modeling of all physical intertransformations and energy-value
transactions, as exclusively expressed heretofore<SUP>&#95;&#95;</SUP>especially
throughout the last century<SUP>&#95;&#95;</SUP>only as algebraic, nonconceptual
transactions. The conceptual modeling of synergetics
does not contradict but complements the exclusively
abstract algebraic expression of physical Universe
relationships that commenced approximately a century
ago with the electromagnetic-wave discoveries
of Hertz and Maxwell. Their electrical-apparatus experiments
made possible empirical verification or discard of
their algebraic treatment of the measured data without
their being able to see or conceptually comprehend
the fundamental energy behaviors.
The permitted discrete algebraic statement and treatment
of invisible phenomena resulted in science's comfortable
yielding to complete abstract mathematical processing
of energy phenomena. The abandonment of conceptual
models removed from the literary men
any conceptual patterns with which they might explain
the evolution of scientific events to the nonmathematically
languaged public. Ergo, the lack of modelability produced
the seemingly unbridgeable social chasm between the
humanities and the sciences.

 A study of the microbiological structures, the radiolaria,
will always show that they are based on either the
tetrahedron, the octahedron, or the icosahedron. The
picture was drawn by English scientists almost a century
ago as they looked
through microscopes at these micro-sea structures. The
development of synergetics did not commence with the
study of these structures of nature, seeking to understand
their logic. The picture of the radiolaria has been
available for 100 years, but I did 
not happen to see it until I had produced the geodesic
structures that derive from the discovery of their
fundamental mathematical principles. In other words,
I did not copy nature's structural patterns. I did
not make arbitrary arrangements for superficial
reasons. I began to explore structure and develop
it in pure mathematical principle, out of which the
patterns emerged in pure principle and developed themselves
in pure principle. I then realized those developed
structural principles as physical forms
and, in due course, applied them to practical tasks.
The reappearance of tensegrity structures in scientists'
findings at various levels of inquiry confirms the
mathematical coordinating system employed by nature.
They are pure coincidence<SUP>&#95;&#95;</SUP>but excitingly
valid coincidence.

 Synergetics represents the coming into congruence
of a mathematical system integrating with the most
incisive physics findings and generalized laws. At
no time am I being scientifically perverse. I am astonished
by a philosophic awareness
of the highest scientific order, which accommodates
the most mystical and mysterious of all human experience.
What we are experiencing is vastly more mystically
profound by virtue of our adherence to experimentally
harvested data than has ever been induced
in human comprehension and imagination by benevolently
implored beliefs in imagined phenomena dogmatically
generated by any of the formalized religions. We are
conscious of aspects of the mysterious integrity Universe
which logically explains that which
we experience and the integrity of the Universe to far
more comprehendable degree than that occurring in the
make-believe, nonscientifically founded communications
of humanity.

 It is a paradox that the computer, in its very ability
to process nonconceptual formulae and awkwardly irrational
constants, has momentarily permitted the extended use
of obsolescent mathematical tools while simultaneously
frustrating man's instinctive drive to comprehend his direct experiences.
The computer has given man physical hardware that has
altered his environmental circumstances without his
understanding how he arrived there. This has brought
about a general disenchantment with 
technology. Enchantment can only be sustained in those
who have it, or regained by those who have lost it,
through conceptual inspiration. Nothing could be more
exciting than the dawning awareness of the discovery
of the presence of another of the eloquently

 The geometrical model of energy configurations in
synergetics is developed from a symmetrical cluster
of spheres, in which each sphere is a model of a field
of energy all of whose forces tend to coordinate themselves,
shuntingly or pulsatively,
and only momentarily in positive or negative asymmetrical
patterns relative to, but never congruent with, the
eternality of the vector equilibrium. The vectors connecting
the centers of the adjacent spheres are identical in
length and angular relationship. 
The forces of the field of energy represented
by each sphere interoscillate through the symmetry
of equilibrium to various asymmetries, never pausing
at equilibrium. The vector equilibrium itself is only
a referential pattern of conceptual relationships 
at which nature never pauses. This closest packing
of spheres in 60-degree angular relationships demonstrates
a finite system in universal geometry. Synergetics
is comprehensive because it describes instantaneously
both the internal and external limit
relationships of the sphere or spheres of energetic
fields; that is, singularly concentric, or plurally
expansive, or propagative and reproductive in all directions,
in either spherical or plane geometrical terms and
in simple arithmetic.

 When energy-as-heat is progressively extracted from
systems by cryogenics, the geometries visibly approach
equilibrium; that is to say, removing energy-as-heat
reduces the asymmetrical pulsativeness in respect to
equilibrium. As the asymmetric 
kinetics of energy-as-heat are removed, and absolute
zero is neared, the whole field of vectors approaches
identical length and identical angular interaction;
that is to say, they approach the model of closest-packed
spherical energy fields. The lines 
interconnecting the adjacent spheres' centers constitute
a vectorial matrix in which all the lines and angles
are identical, which is spoken of by the mathematical
physicists as the isotropic vector matrix, i.e. where
all the energy vectors are identical,
 i.e., in equilibrium: the cosmically absolute zero.

 Comprehension of conceptual mathematics and the return
to modelability in general are among the most critical
factors governing humanity's epochal transition from
bumblebee-like self's honey-seeking preoccupation into
the realistic prospect
of a spontaneously coordinate planetary society. Insect
and avian bumbling in general inadvertently cross-fertilizes
all the vegetation's terrestrial impoundments of the
star-radiated energy which alone regenerates all biological
life around Earth planet.
The vegetational impoundments would be dehydrated
were they not osmotically watercooled by their root-connected
hydraulic circuitry of Earth waters' atomization for
return into the sky-distributed, fresh-water-regenerating
biological support system; and
the rooting frustrates integral procreation of the
vegetation which is regeneratively cross-fertilized
entirely by the insect and avian, entirely unconscious,
pollen-delivering inadvertencies. It is highly probable
that universal comprehension of synergetics is
strategically critical to humanity's exodus
from the womb of originally permitted absolute helplessness
and ignorance at birth and entry into the realization
that planetary society can spontaneously coordinate
in universally successful life support, that is,
achieve freedom from fundamental fear and
political bias inherent in the ignorant assumption
of life-support inadequacy.

 Synergetics augments the prospect of humanity becoming
progressively exploratory. There is clearly disclosed
the desirability of commencing scientific exploration
with synergy-of-synergies Universe: metaphysical and
physical. While synergetics 
seems to open new ranges of cosmic comprehension,
we assume that the time will come when the inventory
of experiences that have catalyzed both its conceptioning
and inception will have become overwhelmed by vaster
experientially based knowledge and
may well become progressively useful but, in its turn,
obsolete. Because the generalized principles cannot
be principles unless they are eternal, and because
human experience is inherently limited, there can be
no finality of human comprehension.
