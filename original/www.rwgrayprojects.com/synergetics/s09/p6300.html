 <B>Synergetics Constant:</B> The synergetics constant was
evolved to convert
third-power, volumetric evaluation from a cubical to
a tetrahedral base and to employ the
ABCD-four-dimensional system's vector as the linear
computational input. In the case of
the cube this is the diagonal of the cube's square face.
Other power values are shown in
Table
 <A HREF="p6300.html#963.10">963.10</A>.
 We have to find the total vector powers
involved in the calculation. In
synergetics we are always dealing in energy content:
when vector edges double together in
quadrivalence or octavalence, the energy content doubles
and fourfolds, respectively.
When the vector edges are half-doubled together, as
in the icosahedron phase of the
jitterbug<SUP>&#95;&#95;</SUP>halfway between the vector equilibrium 20
and the octahedron
compression<SUP>&#95;&#95;</SUP>to fourfold and fivefold contraction with
the vectors only doubled, we can
understand that the volume of energy in the icosahedron
(which is probably the same 20 as
that of the vector equilibrium) is just compressed.

 In Einstein's E = Mc<SUP>2</SUP>, M <I>is</I> volume-to-spherical-wave
ratio of the system
considered. Mass is the integration of relative weight
and volume. What Einstein saw was
that the weight in the weight-to-volume ratio, i.e.,
the Mass, could be reduced and still be
interpreted as the latent energy-per-volume ratio. Einstein's
M <I>is</I> partly identified with
volume and partly with relative energy compactment within
that spherical wave's volume.
There are then relative energy-of-reality concentration-modifiers

 All of the frozen volumetric and superficial area
mensuration of the past has
been derived exclusively from the external linear dimensions.
Synergetics starts system
mensuration at the system center and, employing omni-60-degree
angular coordinates,
expresses the omni-equal, radial and chordal, modular
linear subdivisions in "frequency" of
module subdivisioning of those radii and chords, which
method of mensuration exactly
accommodates both gravitational (coherence) and radiational
(expansion) calculations. As
the length of the vectors represents given mass-times-velocity,
the energy involvements
are inherent in the isotropic vector matrix.

are no continuous shells, there are only energy-event

of energy packages or points in the outer shell of the
system. The second-power number is
derived by multiplying the frequency of wave divisions
of the radius of the system, i.e., F<SUP>2</SUP>

 In the quantum and wave phenomena, we deal with individual
packages. We
do not have continuous surfaces. In synergetics, we
find the familiar practice of second
powering displaying a congruence with the points, or
separate little energy packages of the
shell arrays. Electromagnetic frequencies of systems
are sometimes complex, but they
always exist in complementation of gravitational forces
and together with them provide
prime rational integer characteristics in all physical
systems. Little energy actions, little
separate stars: this is what we mean by quantum. Synergetics
provides geometrical
conceptuality in respect to energy quanta.

powering is synergetically
identified with the total point population involvement

 Third powering identifies with a symmetric swarm of
points around, and in
addition to, the neutral axial line of points. To find
the total number of points collectively

 Arithmetical fourth-power energy evolution order has
been manifest time
and again in experimental physics, but could not be
modelably accommodated by the XYZ-
c.g<SUB>t</SUB>.s. system. That the fourth dimension can be modelably
accommodated by synergetics
is the result of complex local intertransformabilities
because the vector equilibrium has, at
initial frequency zero, an inherent volume of 20. Only
eight cubes can be closest packed in
omnidirectional embracement of any one point in the
XYZ system: in the third powering of
two, which is eight, all point-surrounding space has
been occupied. In synergetics, third
powering is allspace-fillingly accounted in tetrahedral
volume increments; 20 unit volume
tetrahedra close-pack around one point, which point
surrounding reoccurs isotropically in
the centers of the vector equilibria. When the volume
around one is 20, the frequency of
the system is at one. When the XYZ system modular frequency
is at one, the cube volume
is one, while in the vector-equilibrium synergetic system,
the initial volume is 20. When
the frequency of modular subdivision of XYZ cubes reads
two, the volume is eight. When
the vector equilibria's module reads two, the volume
is 20F<SUP>3</SUP> = 20 &#215; 8 = 160 tetrahedral
volumes<SUP>&#95;&#95;</SUP>160 = 25 &#215; 5<SUP>&#95;&#95;</SUP>thus demonstrating the use of conceptual
models for fourth- and
fifth-powering volumetric growth rates. With the initial
frequency of one and the volume
of the vector equilibrium at 20, it also has 24 &#215; 20
A and B Quanta Modules; ergo is
inherently initially 480 quanta modules. 480 = 25 &#215;
5 &#215; 3. With frequency of two the
vector equilibrium is 160 &#215; 24 = 3840 quanta modules.
3840 = 28 &#215; 3 &#215; 5. (See Illus.

three regular

overstuffing which precluded its
capability of providing conceptual modelability of fourth
powering. It was the failure of

fourth-dimensionality is experimentally undemonstrable<SUP>&#95;&#95;</SUP>ergo,

 In an omnimotional Universe, it is possible to join
or lock together two
previously independently moving parts of the system
without immobilizing the remainder
of the system, because four-dimensionality allows local
fixities without in any way locking
or blocking the rest of the system's omnimotioning or
intertransforming. This
independence of local formulation corresponds exactly
with life experiences in Universe.
This omnifreedom is calculatively accommodated by synergetics'
fourth- and fifth-power
transformabilities. (See Sec.

 In synergetics, all experience is identified as, a
priori, unalterably four-
dimensional. We do not have to explain how Universe
began converting chaos to a
"building block" and therefrom simplex to complex. In
synergetics Universe is eternal.
Universe is a complex of omni-interaccommodative principles.
Universe is a priori orderly
and complexedly integral. We do not need imaginary,
nonexistent, inconceivable points,
lines, and planes, out of which non-sensible nothingness
to inventively build reality. Reality
is a priori Universe. What we speak of geometrically
as having been vaguely identified in
early experience as "specks" or dots or points has no
reality. A point in synergetics is a
tetrahedron in its vector-equilibrium, zero-volume state,
but too small for visible
recognition of its conformation. A line is a tetrahedron
of macro altitude and micro base.
A plane is a tetrahedron of macro base and micro altitude.
Points are real, conceptual,
experienceable visually and mentally, as are lines and
planes.

 <B>Tetrahedron as Fourth-Dimension Model:</B> Since the outset
of humanity's
preoccupation exclusively with the XYZ coordinate system,
mathematicians have been
accustomed to figuring the area of a triangle as a product
of the base and one-half its
perpendicular altitude. And the volume of the tetrahedron
is arrived at by multiplying the
area of the base triangle by one-third of its perpendicular
altitude. But the tetrahedron has
four uniquely symmetrical enclosing planes, and its
dimensions may be arrived at by the
use of perpendicular heights above any one of its four
possible bases. That's what the
fourth-dimension system is: it is produced by the angular
and size data arrived at by
measuring the four perpendicular distances between the
tetrahedral centers of volume and
the centers of area of the four faces of the tetrahedron.

 As in the calculation of the area of a triangle, its
altitude is taken as that of
the triangle's apex above the triangular baseline (or
its extensions); so with the
tetrahedron, its altitude is taken as that of the perpendicular
height of the tetrahedron's
vertex above the plane of its base triangle (or that
plane's extension outside the
tetrahedron's triangular base). The four obtuse central
angles of convergence of the four
perpendiculars to the four triangular midfaces of the
regular tetrahedron pass convergently
through the center of tetrahedral volume at 109&deg; 28'.

Column 7's SIXness identifies uniquely with the rhombic
