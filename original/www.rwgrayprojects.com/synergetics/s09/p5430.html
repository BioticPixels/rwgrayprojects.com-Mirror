<B>Nuclear Asymmetric Octahedra:</B> There are eight additional
asymmetric
octahedra Couplers surrounding each face of each <I>Coupler.</I>
It is probable that these eight
asymmetric nuclear octahedra and the large variety of
each of their respective constituent
plus and minus Mite mix may account for all the varieties
of intercomplex complexity
required for the permutations of the 92 regenerative
chemical elements. These eight
variables alone provide for a fantastic number of rearrangements
and reorientations of the
A and B Quanta Modules within exactly the same geometric
domain volume.

 It is possible that there are no other fundamental
complex varieties than
those accounted for by the eight nuclear Coupler-surrounding
asymmetrical octahedra.
There is a mathematical limit of variation<SUP>&#95;&#95;</SUP>with our
friend octave coming in as before.
The Coupler may well be what we have been looking for
when we have been talking about
"number one." It is quite possibly one nucleon, which
can be either neutron or proton,
depending on how you rearrange the modules in the same
space.

 The uniquely asymmetrical octahedron has three XYZ
axes and a center of
volume, K. Its X and Y axes are equal in length, while
the Z axis is shorter than the other
two. The uniquely asymmetrical octahedron is always
polarly symmetrical around its short
Z axis, whose spin equatorial plane is a square whose
diagonals are the equilengthed X and
Y axes. The equatorially spun planes of both the X and
Y axes are similar diamonds, the
short diagonal of each of these diamonds being the Z
axis of the uniquely asymmetrical
octahedron, while the long diagonal of the two similar
diamonds are the X and Y axes,
respectively, of the uniquely asymmetrical octahedron.

 The uniquely asymmetrical octahedron could also be
named the polarly
symmetrical octahedron. There is much that is unique
about it. To begin with the "heart,"
or center of volume of the asymmetrical octahedron (knowable
also as the polarly
symmetrical octahedron, of geometrical volume 1), is
identified by the capital letter K
because K is always the kissing or tangency point between
each and every sphere in all
closest-packed unit radius sphere aggregates; <I>and it
is only through</I> those 12 kissing
(tangency) points symmetrically embracing every closest-packed
sphere that each and all
of the 25 unique great circles of fundamental crystallographic
symmetry must pass<SUP>&#95;&#95;</SUP>those
25 great circles being generated as the 3, 4, 6, 12
= 25 great circle equators of spin of the
only-four-possible axes of symmetry of the vector equilibrium.
Therefore it is only through
those volumetric heart K points of the uniquely asymmetrical
octahedra that energy can
travel electromagnetically, wavelinearly, from here
to there throughout Universe over the
shortest convex paths which they always follow.

 The uniquely asymmetrical octahedron is always uniformly
composed of
exactly eight asymmetrical, allspace-filling, double-isosceles
tetrahedra, the Mites, which
in turn consist of AAB three-quanta modules each. Though
outwardly conformed
identically with one another, the Mites are always either
positively or negatively biased
internally in respect to their energy valving (amplifying,
choking, cutting off, and holding)
proclivities, which are only "potential" when separately
considered, but operationally
effective as interassociated within the allspace-filling,
uniquely asymmetrical octahedron,
and even then muted (i.e., with action suspended as
in a holding pattern) until complexes
of such allspace-filling and regeneratively circuited
energy transactions are initiated.

 The cosmically minimal, allspace-filling Mites' inherent
bias results from
their having always one A + and one A - triple-bonded
(i.e., face-bonded) to constitute a
symmetrical isosceles (two-module) but non-allspace-filling
tetrahedron to either one of
the two external faces, of which either one B + or one
B -can be added to provide the
allspace-filling, semisymmetrical double-isosceles,
triple right-angled, three-moduled Mite,
with its positive and negative bias sublimatingly obscured
by the fact that either the
positive or the negative quantum biasing add together
to produce the same overall
geometrical space-filling tetrahedral form, despite
its quanta-biased composition. This
obscurity accounts for its heretofore unbeknownstness
to science and with that
unbeknownstness its significance as the conceptual link
between the heretofore remote
humanists and the scientists' cerebrating, while with
its discovery comes lucidly
conceptual comprehension of the arithmetical and geometrical
formings of the whole
inventory of the isotopes of all the atoms as explained
by the allspace-filling variety of
internal and external associabilities and reorientings
permitted within and without the
respective local octant-filling of the, also in-turn,
omni-space-filling, uniquely
asymmetrical octahedron, the Coupler.

six-quanta-moduled, double-

the Syte. The asymmetric octahedron

(4 As<SUP>&#95;&#95;</SUP>2 + , 2- <SUP>&#95;&#95;</SUP>and 2 Bs<SUP>&#95;&#95;</SUP>1 + ,

This eight-digited manifold is congruent with the Indig bow-tie wave
--another instance of the congruence of number and geometry in synergetics.
Because of the prime quanta functioning of the allspace-filling Mites,
we observe an elegant confirmation of the omniembracing and

 We give it the name the Coupler because it always
occurs between the
adjacently matching diamond faces of all the symmetrical
allspace-filling rhombic
dodecahedra, the "spherics" (of 96 As and 48 Bs). The
rhombic dodecahedron has the
maximum number (12) of identical (diamond) faces of
all the allspace-filling, unit edge
length, symmetrical polyhedra. That is, it most nearly
approaches sphericity, i.e., the
shortest-radiused, symmetrical, structural, polyhedral
system. And each rhombic
dodecahedron exactly embraces within its own sphere
each of all the closest-packed unit
radius spheres of Universe, and each rhombic dodecahedron's
volumetric center is
congruent with the volumetric center of its enclosed
sphere, while the rhombic
dodecahedron also embracingly accounts, both congruently
and symmetrically, for all the
isotropic-vector-matrix vertexes in closest-packed and
all their "between spaces." The
rhombic dodecahedra are the unique cosmic domains of
their respectively embraced unit
radius closest-packed spheres. The center of area, K,
of each of the 12 external diamond
faces of each rhombic dodecahedron is always congruent
with the internal center of
volume (tangent sphere's kissing points), K, of all
the allspace-filling uniquely
asymmetrical octahedra.

 Thus the uniquely asymmetrical octahedra serve most
economically to join,
or couple, the centers of volume of each of the 12 unit
radius spheres tangentially closest
packed around every closest packed sphere in Universe,
with the center of volume of that
omnisurrounded, ergo nuclear, sphere. However the asymmetrical,
octahedral coupler has
three axes (X, Y, M), and only its X axis is involved
in the most economical intercoupling
of the energy potentials centered within all the closest-packed
unit radius spheres. The Y
and M axes also couple two alternative sets of isotropic-vector-matrix
centers. The M axis
coupling the centers of volume of the concave vector
equilibria shaped between closest-
packed sphere spaces, and the Y axis interconnecting
all the concave octahedral between
spaces of unit-radius closest-packed sphere aggregates,
both of which concave between-
sphere spaces become spheres as all the spheres<SUP>&#95;&#95;</SUP>as convex
vector equilibria or convex
octahedra-transform uniformly, sumtotally, and coincidentally
into concave-between-unit-
radius-sphere spaces. The alternate energy transmitting
orientations of the locally
contained A and B Quanta Modules contained within the
12 couplers of each nuclear set
accommodate all the atomic isotope formulations and
all their concomitant side effects.

 We also call it the Coupler because its volume = 1

modules. The Couplers <I>uniquely bind together</I> each rhombic

 We see that the full variety of energy effects made
by the variety of uniquely
permitted A-and-B-Module rearrangeabilities and reassociabilities
within the unique
volumetric domain of the Coupler manifest a startling
uniqueness in the properties of the
Coupler. One of the Coupler's other unique characteristics
is that its volume is also the
exact prime number 1, which volumetric oneness characterizes
only one other polyhedron
in the isotropic-vector-matrix hierarchy, and that one
other prime-number-one-volumed
polyhedron of our quantum system is the symmetric, initial-and-minimal-structural
system
of Universe: the 24-module regular tetrahedron. Here
we may be identifying the cosmic

volume as the regular tetrahedron, which is not allspace-filling.
We go on to identify them
with the proton's and neutron's non-mirror-imaged complementation
and
intertransformability, because one consists of 24 blue
A Modules while the other consists
of sixteen blue As and eight red Bs, which renders them
not only dissimilar in fundamental
geometric conformation, but behaviorally <I>different</I> in
that the As are energy-inhibiting and
the Bs are either energy-inhibiting or energy-dissipating
in respect to their intramural

 When we consider that each of the eight couplers which
surround each
nuclear coupler may consist of any of 36 different AAB
intramural orientations, we
comprehend that the number of potentially unique nucleus
and nuclear-shell
interpatternings is adequate to account for all chemical
element isotopal variations, as well
as accommodation in situ for all the nuclear substructurings,
while doing so by
omnirational quantation and without any external manifestation

 Neatly seated in the diamond-rimmed valley of the
rhombic dodecahedron,
the unique asymmetrical octahedron's Z axis is congruent
with the short diagonal, and its
Y axis is congruent with the long diagonal of the diamond-rimmed
valley in the rhombic
dodecahedron's face into which it is seated. This leaves
the X axis of the uniquely
asymmetrical octahedron running perpendicular to the
diamond face of the diamond-
rimmed valley in which it so neatly sits; and its X
axis runs perpendicularly through the K
point, to join together most economically and directly
the adjacent hearts (volumetric
centers) of all adjacently closest-packed, unit radius
spheres of Universe. That is, the X
axes connect each nuclear sphere heart with the hearts
of the 12 spheres closest-packed
around it, while the Y axis, running perpendicularly
to the X axis, most economically joins
the hearts (volumetric centers) of the only circumferentially
adjacent spheres surrounding
the nuclear sphere at the heart of the rhombic dodecahedron,
but not interconnecting with
those nuclear spheres' hearts. Thus the Y axes interlink
an omnisymmetrical network of
tangential, unit-radius spheres in such a manner that
each sphere's heart is interconnected
with the hearts of only six symmetrically interarrayed
tangentially adjacent spheres. This
alternate interlinkage package of each-with-six, instead
of(six-with-twelve, other adjacent
spheres, leaves every other space in a closest-packed,
isotropic-vector-matrixed Universe
centrally unconnected from its heart with adjacent hearts,
a condition which, discussed
elsewhere, operates in Universe in such a way as to
permit two of the very important
phenomena of Universe to occur: (1) electromagnetic
wave propagations, and (2) the
ability of objects to move through or penetrate inherently
noncompressible fluid mediums.
This phenomenon also operates in such a manner that,
in respect to the vertexes of
isotropic vector matrixes, only every other one becomes
the center of a sphere, and every
other vertex becomes the center of a nonsphere of the
space interspersing the spheres in
closest packing, whereby those spaces resolve themselves
into two types<SUP>&#95;&#95;</SUP>concave vector
equilibria and concave octahedra. And, whenever a force
is applied to such a matrix every
sphere becomes a space and every space becomes a sphere,
which swift intertransforming
repeats itself as the force encounters another sphere,
whereby the sphere vanishes and the
resulting space is penetrated.

 We also find that the A and B Module rearrangeabilities
can vary the
intensity of interconnecting in four magnitudes of intensity
or of zero intensity, and can
also interconnect the three X and Y and M systems simultaneously
in either balanced or
unbalanced manners. The unique asymmetric octahedra
are in fact so unique as to
constitute the actual visual spin variable mechanisms
of Dirac's quantum mechanics, which
have heretofore been considered utterly abstract and

 <B>Possible Relevance to Periodic Table of the Elements:</B>
These are
interesting numbers because the 28/l44ths and the 116/144ths,
reduced to their least
common denominator, disclose two prime numbers, i.e.,
<I>seven</I> and <I>twenty-nine,</I> which,
together with the prime numbers 1, 2, 3, 5, and 13,
are already manifest in the rational
structural evolvement with the modules' discovered relationships
of unique nuclear events.
This rational emergence of the prime numbers 1, 3, 5,
7, 13, and 29 by whole structural
increments of whole unit volume modules has interesting
synergetic relevance to the
rational interaccommodation of all the interrelationship
permutation possibilities involved
in the periodic table of the 92 regenerative chemical
elements, as well as in all the number
evolvements of all the spherical trigonometric function
intercalculations necessary to
define rationally all the unique nuclear vector-equilibrium
intertransformabilities and their
intersymmetric-phase maximum aberration and asymmetric
pulsations. (See Sec.
