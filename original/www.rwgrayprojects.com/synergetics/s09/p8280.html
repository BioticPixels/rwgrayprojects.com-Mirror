 <B>Closest Packing of Circles:</B> Because we may now give
the dimensions of
any sphere as 5F<SUP>n</SUP>, we have no need for <I>pi</I> in developing
spheres holistically. According
to our exploratory strategy, however, we may devise
one great circle of one sphere of unit
rational value, and, assuming our circle also to be
rational and a whole number, we may
learn what the mathematical relationship to <I>pi</I> may be<SUP>&#95;&#95;</SUP>lengthwise<SUP>&#95;&#95;</SUP>of
our a priori circle
as a whole part of a whole sphere. We know that <I>pi</I> is
the length of a circle as expressed in
the diameters of the circle, a relationship that holds
always to the transcendentally
irrational number 3.14159. But the relationship of volume
5 to the radius of one of our
spheres is not altered by the circumference-to-diameter
relationship because we commence
with the omnidimensional wholeness of reality.

 We recall also that both Newton and Leibnitz in evolving
the calculus
thought in terms of a circle as consisting of an infinite
number of short chords. We are
therefore only modifying their thinking to accommodate
the manifest discontinuity of all
physical phenomena as described by modern physics when
we explore the concept of a
circle as an aggregate of short event-vectors<SUP>&#95;&#95;</SUP>tangents
(instead of Newtonian short
chords) whose tangential overall length must be greater
than that of the circumference of
the theoretical circle inscribed within those tangent
event-vectors<SUP>&#95;&#95;</SUP>just as Newton's
chords were shorter than the circle encompassing them.

 If this is logical, experimentally informed thinking,
we can also consider the
closest-tangential-packing of circles on a plane that
produces a non-all-area-filling pattern
with concave triangles occurring between the circles.
Supposing we allowed the
perimeters of the circles to yield bendingly outward
from the circular centers and we
crowded the circles together while keeping themselves
as omni-integrally, symmetrically,
and aggregatedly together, interpatterned on the plane
with their areal centers always
equidistantly apart; we would find then<SUP>&#95;&#95;</SUP>as floor-tile
makers learned long ago<SUP>&#95;&#95;</SUP>that when
closest packed with perimeters congruent, they would
take on any one of three and only
three possible polygonal shapes: the hexagon, the square,
or the triangle<SUP>&#95;&#95;</SUP>closest-packed
hexagons, whose perimeters are exactly three times their
diameters. Hexagons are, of
course, cross sections through the vector equilibrium.
The hexagon's six radial vectors
exactly equal the six chordal sections of its perimeter.

 Assuming the vector equilibrium hexagon to be the
relaxed, cosmic, neutral,
zero energy-events state, we will have the flexible
but not stretchable hexagonal perimeter
spun rapidly so that all of its chords are centrifugally
expelled into arcs and the whole
perimeter becomes a circle with its radius necessarily
contracted to allow for the bending
of the chords. It is this circle with its perimeter
equalling six that we will now convert, first
into a square of perimeter six and then into a triangle
of perimeter six with the following
results:

(In the case of the square, the radius is taken from

In the triangle the radius is taken to the comer, not

the radius of the square phase of the closest-packed
circle is 1.060660, the synergetics

 In accomplishing these transformations of the uniformly-perimetered
symmetrical shapes, it is also of significance that
the area of six equiangular, uniform-
edged triangles is reduced to four such triangles. Therefore,
it would take more
equiperimeter triangular tiles or squares to pave a
given large floor area than it would
using equiperimetered hexagons. We thus discover that
the hexagon becomes in fact the
densest-packed patterning of the circles; as did the
rhombic dodecahedron become the
minimal limit case of self-packing allspace-filling
in isometric domain form in the
synergetical from-whole-to-particular strategy of discovery;
while the rhombic
dodecahedron is the six-dimensional state of omni-densest-packed,
nuclear field domains;
as did the two-frequency cube become the maximum subfrequency
self-packing, allspace-
filling symmetrical domain, nuclear-uniqueness, expandability
and omni-
intertransformable, intersymmetrical, polyhedral evolvement
field; as did the limit-of-
nuclear-uniqueness, minimally at three-frequency complexity,
self-packing, allspace-filling,
semi-asymmetric octahedron of Critchlow; and maximally
by the three-frequency, four-
dimensional, self-packing, allspace-filling tetrakaidecahedron:
these two, together with the
cube and the rhombic dodecahedron constitute the only-four-is-the-limit-system
set of
self-packing, allspace-filling, symmetrical polyhedra.
These symmetrical realizations
approach a neatness of cosmic order.

volume of 4.188; corrected for
tetrahedral value we have 4.188 &#215; 1.193 = 4.996 = 5
tetrahedra = 1 sphere. Applying the
S<SUP>2</SUP> to the area of a circle of radius 1, (pi = 3.14159)
3.14159 &#215; 1.125 = 3.534 for the

 We may also employ the XYZ to synergetics conversion
factors between
commonly based squares and equiangled triangles: from
a square to a triangle the factor is
2.3094; from a triangle to a square the factor is 0.433.
The constant pi 3.14159 &#215; 2.3094
= 7.254 = 7 1/4; thus 7 1/4 triangles equal the area
of a circle of radius 1. Since the circle
of a sphere equals exactly four circular areas of the
same radius, 7 1/4 &#215; 4 = 29 = area of
the surface of a sphere of radius 1.

 The area of a hexagon of radius 1 shows the hexagon
with its vertexes lying
equidistantly from one another in the circle of radius
1 and since the radii and chords of a
hexagon are equal, then the six equilateral triangles
in the hexagon plus 1 1/4 such
triangles in the arc-chord zones equal the area of the
circle: 1.25/6 = 0.208 zone arc-chord
area. Wherefore the area of a circle of frequency 2
= 29 triangles and the surface of a
sphere of radius 2 = 116 equilateral triangles.

 For the 120 LCD spherical triangles S = 4; S = 4 for
four greatcircle areas of
the surface of a sphere; therefore S for one great-circle
area equals exactly one spherical
triangle, since 120/4 = 30 spherical triangles vs. 116/4
= 29 equilateral triangles. The S
disparity of 1 is between a right spherical triangle
and a planar equiangular triangle. Each
of the 120 spherical LCD triangles has exactly six degrees
of spherical excess, their three
corners being 90 degrees, 60 degrees and 36 degrees
vs. 90 degrees, 60 degrees, 30
degrees of their corresponding planar triangle. Therefore,
6 degrees per each spherical
triangle times 120 spherical triangles amounts to a
total of 720 degrees spherical excess,
which equals exactly one tetrahedron, which exact excessiveness
elucidates and elegantly
agrees with previous discoveries (see Secs.

 The synergetical definition of an operational sphere
(vs. that of the Greeks)
finds the spheric experience to be operationally always
a star-point-vertexed polyhedron,
and there is always a 720 degree (one tetrahedron) excess
of the Greek's sphere's
assumption of 360 degrees around each vertex vs. the
operational sum of the external
angles of any system, whether it be the very highest
frequency (seemingly "pure"
spherical) regular polyhedral system experience of the
high-frequency geodesic spheres, or

 <B>Spheric Experience:</B> Experientially defined, the spheric
experience, i.e., a
sphere, is an aggregate of critical-proximity event
"points." Points are a multidimensional
set of crossings of orbits: traceries, foci, fixes,
vertexes coming cometlike almost within
intertouchability and vertexing within cosmically remote
regions. Each point consists of
three or more vectorially convergent events approximately
equidistant from one
approximately locatable and as yet nondifferentially
resolved, point; i.e., three or more
visualizable, four-dimensional vectors' most critical
proximity, convergently-divergently
interpassing region, local, locus, terminal and macrocosmically
the most complex of such
point events are the celestial stars; i.e., the highest-speed,
high-frequency energy event,
importing-exporting exchange centers. Microcosmically
the atoms are the inbound
terminals of such omniorderly exchange systems.

complexity and polyhedral system unity consist structurally
of discontinuously islanded,
critical-proximity-event huddles, compressionally convergent
events, only tensionally and
omni-interattractively cohered. The pattern integrities
of all spheres are the high-
frequency, traffic-described subdivisionings of either
tetrahedral, octahedral, or
icosahedral angular interference, intertriangulating
structures profiling one, many, or all of
their respective great-circle orbiting and spinning
event characteristics. A11 spheres are
highfrequency geodesic spheres, i.e., triangular-faceted
polyhedra, most frequently
icosahedral because the icosasphere is the structurally
most economical.
