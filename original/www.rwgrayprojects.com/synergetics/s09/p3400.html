 If we take three columns of tetrahelixes and nest
them into one another, we
see that they also apparently internest neatly as with
a three-part rope twist; but upon
pressing them together to close the last narrow gap
between them we discover that they
are stubbornly resisting the final closure because the
core pattern they make is one in
which five tetrahedra are triple-bonded around a common
edge axis<SUP>&#95;&#95;</SUP>which angular gap is
impossible to close.

 Five tetrahedra triple-bonded to one another around
a common edge axis
leave an angular sinus<SUP>2</SUP> of 7&deg; 20' as the <I>birth unzipping</I>
angle of DNA-RNA behaviors.
This gap could be shared 10 ways, i.e., by two faces
each of the five circle-closing
tetrahedra, and only 44 minutes of circular arc per
each tetra face, each of whose two
faces might be only alternatingly edge-bonded, or hinged,
to the next, which almost-
closed, face-toward-face, hinge condition would mechanically
accommodate the spanned
coherence of this humanly-invisible, 44-minutes-of-circular-arc,
distance of
interadherence. Making such a tetrahelix column could
be exactly accomplished by only
hinging one edge of each tetrahedron to the next, always
making the next hinge with one
of the two-out-of-three edges not employed in the previous
hinge. Whatever the method
of interlinkage, this birth dichotomy is apparently
both <I>accommodated by</I> and <I>caused by</I>
this invisible, molecular biologist's 1&deg; 28' per tetra
and 7&deg; 20' per helical-cycle hinge
opening.

 Unzipping occurs as the birth dichotomy and the new
life breaks off from the
old pattern with a perfect imprint and repeats the other's
growth pattern. These helixes
have the ability to nest by virtue of the hinge-spring
linkage by which one is being
imprinted on the other. Positive columns nest with and
imprint only upon positive helix
columns and negative helix columns nest with and imprint
their code pattern only with and
upon negative helix columns. Therefore, when a column
comes off, i.e., unzips, it is a
replica of the original column.

 We know that the edge angle of a tetrahedron is 70&deg;
32', and five times that
is 352&deg; 40', which is 7&deg; 20' less than 360&deg;. In other
words, five tetrahedra around a
common edge axis do not close up and make 360 degrees,
because the dihedral angles are
7&deg; 20' short. But when they are brought together in a
helix<SUP>&#95;&#95;</SUP>due to the fact that a hinged
helix is a coil spring<SUP>&#95;&#95;</SUP>the columns will twist enough
to permit the progressive gaps to be
closed. No matter how long the tetrahelix columns are,
their sets of coil springs will
contract enough to bring them together. The backed-up
spring tries constantly to <I>unzip</I>
one nesting tetrahedron from the others of which it
is a true replica. These are only
synergetical conjectures as to the theoretical explanations
of otherwise as yet unexplained
behaviors of the DNA.

 Though classic science at the opening of the 18th
century had achieved many
remarkably accurate observations and calculations regarding
the behaviors of light,
individual scientists and their formal societies<SUP>&#95;&#95;</SUP>with
one notable exception-remained
unaware that light (and radiation in general) has a
speed. Ole Roemer (1644<SUP>&#95;&#95;</SUP>1710), both
Royal Astronomer and Royal Mathematician of Denmark,
was that exception. Roemer's
observations of the reflected light of the revolving
moons of the planet Jupiter made him
surmise that light has a speed. His calculations from
the observed data very closely
approximated the figure for that speed as meticulously
measured in vacuo two centuries
later, in the Michelson-Morley experiment of 1887. Though
Roemer was well accredited
by the scientists and scientific societies of Europe,
this hypothesis of his seemed to escape
their cosmological considerations. Being overlooked,
the concept did not enter into any of
the cosmological formulations (either academic or general)
of humanity until the 20th
century.

 Until the 20th century scientists in general assumed
the light of all the stars
to be instantaneously and simultaneously extant. Universe
was an instantaneous and
simultaneous system. The mid-19th-century development
of thermodynamics, and in
particular its second law, introduced the concept that
all systems always lose energy and
do so in ever-increasingly disorderly and expansive
ways. The academicians spontaneously
interpreted the instantaneity and simultaneity of Universe
as requiring that the Universe
too must be categorized as a system; the academicians
assumed that as a system Universe
itself must be losing energy in increasingly expansive
and disorderly ways. Any
expenditure of energy by humans on Earth<SUP>&#95;&#95;</SUP>to whom the
stars in the heavens were just so
much romantic scenery; no more, no less<SUP>&#95;&#95;</SUP>would hasten
the end of the Universe. This
concept was the foundation of classical conservatism<SUP>&#95;&#95;</SUP>economic,
political, and
philosophical. Those who "spent" energy were abhorred.

 This viewpoint was fortified by the hundred-years-earlier
concept of classical
science's giant, Isaac Newton, who in his first law
of motion stated that all bodies persist
in a state of rest, or in a line of motion, except as
affected by other bodies. This law posits
a cosmic norm of <I>at rest:</I> change is abnormal. This viewpoint
as yet persists in all the
graphic-chart coordinates used by society today for
plotting performance magnitudes
against a time background wherein the baseline of "no
change" is the norm. Change is
taken spontaneously as being inherently abnormal and
is as yet interpreted by many as
being cause for fundamental social concern.

 With the accurate measurement, in 1887, of the speed
of light in vacuo,
science had comprehensively new, experimentally redemonstrable
challenges to its
cosmogony and cosmology. Inspired by the combined discoveries
of the Brownian
movement, black body radiation, and the photon of light,
Einstein, Planck, and others
recognized that energy-as-radiation has a top speed<SUP>&#95;&#95;</SUP>ergo,
is finitely terminaled<SUP>&#95;&#95;</SUP>but
among them, Einstein seems to have convinced himself
that his own cosmological
deliberations should assume Boltzmann's concept to be
valid<SUP>&#95;&#95;</SUP>ergo, always to be included
in his own exploratory thoughts. There being no experimental
evidence of energy ever
being created or lost, universal energy is apparently
conserved. Wherefore Boltzmann had
hypothesized that energy progressively and broadcastingly
exported from various localities
in Universe must be progressively imported and reassembled
at other localities in
Universe.

 Boltzmann's concept was analogous to that upon which
was developed the
theory and practice of the 20th-century meteorological
weather forecasting, which
recognizes that our terrestrial atmosphere's plurality
of high-pressure areas are being
progressively exhausted at different rates by a plurality
of neighboring low-pressure areas,
which accumulate atmospheric molecules and energy until
they in turn become new high-
pressure areas, which are next to be progressively exhausted
by other newly initiated low-
pressure areas. The interpatterning of the various importing-exporting
centers always
changes kaleidoscopically because of varying speeds
of moisture formation or
precipitation, speeds and directions of travel, and
local thermal conditions.

 Einstein assumed hypothetically that energies given
off omnidirectionally
with the ever-increasing disorder of entropy by all
the stars were being antientropically
imported, sorted, and accumulated in various other elsewheres.
He showed that when
radiant energy interferes with itself, it can, and probably
does, tie itself precessionally into
local and orderly knots. Einstein must have noted that
on Earth children do not
disintegrate entropically but multiply their hydrocarbon
molecules in an orderly fashion;
little saplings grow in an orderly way to become big
trees. Einstein assumed Earthian
biology to be reverse entropy. (This account does not
presume to recapitulate the actual
thought processes of Einstein at any given point in
the development of his philosophy;
rather it attempts to illustrate some of the inevitable
conclusions that derive from his
premises.)

 One quantum of energy always consists of six energy
vectors, each being a
combined push-pull, positive-negative force. (See Secs.
 <A HREF="../s06/p0000.html#600.02">600.02</A> through
 <A HREF="../s06/p0900.html#612.01">612.01</A>
 and Fig.
 <A HREF="../s06/p2000.html#620.06">620.06</A>.)
Twelve unique forces: six plus and six minus.
Six vectors break into two sets of
three each. Classical engineers assumed that each action
had its equal and opposite
reaction at 180 degrees; but since the discovery of
the speed of light and the
understanding of nonsimultaneity, we find that every
action has not only a reaction but
also a <I>resultant.</I> Neither the reaction nor the resultant
are angularly "opposite" in 180-
degree azimuth from the direction of action. The "equal
and opposite" of classical
engineering meant that both action and reaction occurred
in opposite directions in the
same straight line in the same geometrical plane. But
since the recognition of
nonsimultaneity and the speed of light, it has been
seen that action, reaction, and resultant
vectors react omnidirectionally and precessionally at
angles other than 180 degrees. (See
Fig. <A HREF="../s05/p1000.html#511.20">511.20</A>.)

 As we enter the last quarter of the 20th century,
it is recognized in quantum
mechanics and astrophysics that there could never have
existed the traditionally assumed,
a priori universal chaos, a chaos from which it was
also assumed that Universe had
escaped only by the workings of chance and the long-odds-against
mathematical
probability of a sequence of myriad-illions of coincidences,
which altogether produced a
universal complex of orderly evolutionary events. This
nonsense was forsaken by the
astrophysicists only a score of years ago, and only
because science has learned in the last
few decades that both the proton and the neutron always
and only coexist in a most
orderly interrelationship. They do not have the same
mass, and yet the one can be
transformed into the other by employing both of their
respective two energy side effects;
i.e., those of both the proton and the neutron. Both
the proton and the neutron have their
respective and unique two-angle-forming patterns of
three interlinked lines, each
representing their action, reaction, and resultant vectors.

 The names of the players, the positions they play,
and the identifying letters
they wear on the three-vector teams of proton and neutron,
respectively, are identified as
follows. The proton's three-vector team consists of
<OL TYPE="1">
<LI> the <I>action</I> vector, played by its captain, the <I>proton,</I>
wearing the letters BD;
<LI> the <I>reaction</I> vector, played by the <I>electron,</I> wearing
the letters AD; and
<LI> the <I>resultant</I> vector, played by the <I>antineutrino,</I>
wearing the letters BC.
</OL>
The neutron's three-vector team consists of
<OL TYPE="1">
<LI> the <I>action</I> vector, played by its captain, the <I>neutron,</I>
wearing the letters A C;
<LI> the <I>reaction</I> vector, played by the <I>positron,</I> wearing
the letters CD; and
<LI> the <I>resultant</I> vector, played by the <I>neutrino,</I> wearing
the letters AB.
</OL>
Either one of these two teams of three-vector events
is identified in quantum mechanics as
being a half-quantum (or one-half spin or one-half Planck's
constant). When two half-
quanta associate, they produce one unit of quantum.
(See Sec.
 <A HREF="../s02/p4000.html#240.65">240.65</A>.) These two sets of
three vectors each combine to produce the six vector
edges of the tetrahedron, which is
the minimum structural system of Universe: one quantum
of energy thus becomes
structurally and systematically conceptual. (See Fig.
935.23.) One quantum of energy
equals one tetrahedron. Humanist writers and broadcasters
take notice that science has
regained conceptuality. Science's intertransformabilities
and intercomplementarities are
modelably demonstrable. The century-long chasm that
has separated science and the
humanities has vanished.

 The tetrahedral model of the quantum as the minimum
structural system of
Universe is a prime component in producing the conceptual
bridge to span the vast chasm
identified by C. P. Snow as having for so long existed
between the one percent of the
world people who are scientists and the 99 percent of
humanity comprehendingly
communicated with by the writers in literature and the
humanities. This chasm has been
inadvertently sustained by the use of an exclusively
mathematical language of abstract
equations on the part of scientists, thus utterly frustrating
the comprehension of the
scientists' work by the 99 percent of humanity that
does not communicate mathematically.
This book, <I>Synergetics,</I> contains the conceptualizing
adequate to the chasm-bridging task,
and it does so in vectorially structured geometry and
in exclusively low-order prime
numbers in rational whole-number accounting.

 As an instance of chasm-spanning between science and
the humanities by
conceptually transformative energy-quanta accounting,
synergetics conceptually elucidates
the Boltzmann import-export, entropy-syntropy transaction
and the elegant manner in
which nature accommodates the "hidden ball" play of
now-you-see-it-now-you-don't
energy transference.
