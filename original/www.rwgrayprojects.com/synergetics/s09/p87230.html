 Of the seven equatorial symmetries first employed in
the progression of self-
fractionations or cleavages, we use the tetrahedron's
six mid-edge poles to serve as the
three axes of spinnability. These three great-circle
spinnings delineate the succession of
cleavages of the 12 edges of the tetra-contained octahedron
whose six vertexes are
congruent with the regular tetrahedron's six midedge
polar spin points. The octahedron
resulting from the first cleavage has 12 edges; they
produce the additional external surface
lines necessary to describe the two-frequency, non-time-size
subdividing of the primitive
one-frequency tetrahedron. (See Sec.
 <A HREF="../s05/p2400.html#526.23">526.23</A>, which describes
how four happenings' loci
are required to produce and confirm a system discovery.)

 The midpoints of the 12 edges of the octahedron formed
by the first cleavage
provide the 12 poles for the further great-circle spinning
and Cleavage #2 of both the tetra
and its contained octa by the six great circles of Symmetry
#3. Cleavage #2 also locates
the center-of-volume nucleus of the tetra and separates
out the center-of-volume-

the six sets of great-circle

 This four-great-circle interaction in turn defines
the 24 equilengthed
vectorial radii and 24 equi-lengthed vector chords of
the VE. The 24 radii are grouped, by
construction, in two congruent sets, thereby to appear
as only 12 radii. Because the 24
radial vectors exactly equal energetically the circumferentially
closed system of 24
vectorial chords, we give this system the name vector
equilibrium. Its most unstable, only
transitional, equilibrious state serves nature's cosmic,
ceaseless, 100-percent-energy-
efficient, self-regenerative integrity by providing
the most expansive state of
intertransformation accommodation of the original hierarchy
of primitive, pre-time-size,
"click-stop" <I>rational</I> states of energy-involvement accountabilities.
Here we have in the
VE the eight possible phases of the initial positive-negative
tetrahedron occurring as an
inter-double-bonded (edge-bonded), vertex-paired, self-inter-coupling
nuclear system.

 With the nucleated set of 12 equi-radius vertexial
spheres all closest packed
around one nuclear unit-radius sphere, we found we had
eight tetrahedra and six Half-
octahedra defined by this VE assembly, the total volume
of which is 20. But all of the six
Half-octahedra are completely unstable as the 12 spheres
cornering their six square
windows try to contract to produce six diamonds or 12
equiangular triangles to ensure
their interpatterning stability. (See Fig.

 When this denucleation happens, the long diagonals
of the six squares
contract to unit-vector-radius length. The squares that

unit vectors were squares whose edges<SUP>&#95;&#95;</SUP>being exactly

of its sqrt(2)-lengthed,
interattractive-relationship lines transform into a

length. The difference
between the second root of two (which is 1.414214 -
1, i.e., the difference is 0.414214)
occurs six times, which amounts to a total system contraction
of 2.485284. This in turn
means that the original

the icosahedron is arrived at

 When all the foregoing is comprehended, it is realized
that the whole
concept of multiplication of information by division
also embraces the concept of
removing or separating out the nucleus sphere (vertex)
from the VE's structurally unstable
state and, as the jitterbug model shows, arriving omnisymmetrically
throughout the
transition at the structural stability of the icosahedron.
The icosahedron experimentally
evidences its further self-fractionation by its three
different polar great-circle hemispherical
cleavages that consistently follow the process of progressive
self-fractionations as spin-
halved successively around respective #5, #6, and #7
axes of symmetry. These successive
halvings develop various fractions corresponding in
arithmetical differentiation degrees, as
is shown in this exploratory accounting of the hierarchy
of unit-vector delineating
multiplication of information only by progressive subdividing
of parts.

 The positive and negative tetrahedra, when composited
as symmetrically
concentric and structurally stable, have eight symmetrically
interarranged vertexes defining
the corners of what in the past has been mistakenly
identified as a primitive polyhedron,
popularly and academically called the "cube" or hexahedron.
Cubes do not exist
primitively because they are structurally unstable,
having no triangularly-self-stabilizing
system pattern. They occur frequently in nature's crystals
but only as the superficial aspect
of a conglomerate complex of omnitriangulated polyhedra.

The rhombic dodecahedron exactly occupies the geometric
domain of each unit-vector-
radius sphere and that sphere's external share of the
symmetrically identical spaces
intervening between closest-packed unit-radius spheres
of any and all aggregates of unit-
radius, closest-interpacked spheres. In this closest-packed
condition each sphere within the
aggregate always has 12 spheres symmetrically closest
packed tangentially around it. The
midpoints of the 12 diamond faces of the rhombic dodecahedron's
12 faces are congruent
with the points of tangency of the 12 surrounding spheres.
All the foregoing explains why
unit-radius rhombic dodecahedra fill allspace when joined
together.

 Repeating the foregoing more economically we may say
that in this hierarchy
of omnisymmetric primitive polyhedra ranging from I
through 2, 2 , 3, 4, 5,
and 6 tetravolumes, the rhombic dodecahedron's 12 diamond-face-midpoints
occur at the
points of intertangency of the 12 surrounding spheres.
It is thus disclosed that the rhombic
dodecahedron is not only the symmetric domain of both
the sphere itself and the sphere's
symmetric share of the space intervening between all
closest-packed spheres and therefore
also of the nuclear domains of all isotropic vector
matrixes (Sec.
 <A HREF="../s04/p2000.html#420.00">420</A>), but the rhombic
dodecahedron is also the maximum-limit-volumed primitive
polyhedron of frequency-l.
