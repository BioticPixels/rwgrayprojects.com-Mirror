 The exposition herein recounts and recapitulates the
original surprise and
excitement of the progressive, empirically verified
conceptionings; the family of relevant
experimental-evidence recalls; the modus operandi; the
successive, only-evolutionarily-

of the omniinterresultant cosmic
significance of these strategically employable, synergetically
critical additions to human

 My first mathematics and geometry teachers taught me
games that I learned
to play well enough to obtain swiftly the answers for
which their (only-axiomatically-
argued) assumptions called. Webster's dictionary states
tersely the definitions of the
games they taught me. Webster's definitions are carefully
formulated by leading academic
authorities and represent the up-to-the-minute concensus
of what the educational system
assumes <I>geometry, mathematics,</I> and <I>science</I> to consist.

 Physics has found no surfaces and no solids: only localized
regions of high-
frequency, self-interfering, deflecting, and consequently
self-knotting energy events. These
self-interference patterns occur in pure principle of
ultra-high-frequency intervals and on
so minuscule a scale as to prohibit intrusion by anything
so dimensionally gross and slow
as our fingers. We cannot put our fingers between any
two of all the numbers occurring

 How do you see through a solid-glass window? Light
passes through glass.
Light is high-frequency radiation passing unobstructedly
at 700 million miles per hour with
lots of time and room "to spare" between the set of
energy events that constitute the
atomic-event constellation known as "glass." (In lenses
the light caroms off atoms to have
its course deliberately and angularly altered.)

 In respect to those definitions I was taught, between
1905 and 1913 at the
private preparatory school then most highly regarded
by Harvard, that "the properties of a
point" are nonexistent<SUP>&#95;&#95;</SUP>that a point is nondimensional
or infradimensional, weightless,
and timeless. The teacher had opened the day's lesson
by making a white chalk mark on
the cleanly washed-off blackboard and saying, "This
is a point." I was next taught that a
line is one dimensional and consists of a "straight"
row of nondimensional points<SUP>&#95;&#95;</SUP>and I
am informed that today, in 1978, all schoolchildren
around the world are as yet being so
taught. Since such a line lacks three-dimensionality,
it too is nonexistent to the second
power or to "the square root of nonexistence." We were
told by our mathematics teacher
that the plane is a raft of tangentially parallel rows
of nonexistent lines<SUP>&#95;&#95;</SUP>ergo, either a
third power or a "cube root of nonexistence"<SUP>&#95;&#95;</SUP>while the
supposedly "real" cube of three
dimensions is a rectilinear stack of those nonexistent
planes and therefore must be either a
fourth power or a fourth root of nonexistence. Since
the cube lacked weight, temperature,
or duration in time, and since its empty 12-edged frame
of nonexistent lines would not
hold its shape, it was preposterously nondemonstrable<SUP>&#95;&#95;</SUP>ergo,
a treacherous device for
students and useful only in playing the game of deliberate
self-deception. Since it was
arbitrarily compounded of avowedly nonexistent points,
the socially accepted three-
dimensional reality of the academic system was not "derived
from observation and
study"<SUP>&#95;&#95;</SUP>ergo, was to me utterly unscientific.

 The scientific generalized eternal principle of <I>leverage</I>
can be experientially
demonstrated, and its rate of lifting-advantage-gain
per each additional modular increment
of lifting-arm length can be mathematically expressed
to cover any and all special case
temporal realizations of the leverage principle. Biological
species can be likewise
generalizingly defined. So in many ways humanity has
been able to sort out its experiences
and identify various prominent sets and subsets of interrelationship
principles. The special-

the set of all the orioles, the class of all
birds, the class of all somethings, the class of all

common discovery of readily
recognized, differentiated, and remembered generalizable
sets of constantly manifest
residual interrelationship principles<SUP>&#95;&#95;</SUP>swiftly persuaded
mathematical thinkers to adopt the
symbolism of algebra, whose known and unknown components
and their relationships
could be identified by conveniently chosen empty-set
symbols. The intellectuals call this

 It was a very different matter, however, when in supposed
scientific integrity
mathematicians undertook to abstract the geometry of
structural phenomena. They began
their geometrical science by employing only three independent
systems: one supposedly
"straight"-edged ruler, one scribing tool, and one pair
of adjustable-angle dividers.

 Realistically unaware that they were on a spherical
planet, the Greek
geometers were first preoccupied with only plane geometry.
These Greek plane geometers
failed to recognize and identify the equally important
individual integrity of the system
upon whose invisibly structured surface they were scribing.
The Euclidean mathematicians
had a geocentric fixation and were oblivious to any
concept of our planet as an includable
item in their tool inventory. They were also either
ignorant of<SUP>&#95;&#95;</SUP>or deliberately
overlooked<SUP>&#95;&#95;</SUP>the systematically associative minimal complex
of inter-self-stabilizing forces
(vectors) operative in structuring any system (let alone
our planet) and of the
corresponding cosmic forces (vectors) acting locally
upon a structural system. These
forces must be locally coped with to insure the local
system's structural integrity, which
experientially demonstrable force-interaction requirements
are accomplishable only by
scientific intertriangulations of the force vectors.
Their assumption that a square or a cube
could hold its own structural shape proves their oblivousness
to the force (vector)
interpatternings of all structurally stable systems
in Universe. To them, structures were
made only of stone walls<SUP>&#95;&#95;</SUP>and stone held its own shape.

 The Ionian Greeks seem to have been self-deceived into
accepting as an
absolute continuum the surface of what also seemed to
them to be absolutely solid items
of their experience<SUP>&#95;&#95;</SUP>whether as randomly fractured, eroded,
or ground-apart solids or as
humanly carved or molded symmetrical shapes. The Ionian
Greeks did not challenge the
self-evident <I>axiomatic</I> solid integrity of their superficial-continuum,
surface-face-area
assumptions by such thoughts as those of the somewhat
later, brilliantly intuitive, scientific
speculation of Democritus, which held that matter might
consist of a vast number of
invisible minimum somethings<SUP>&#95;&#95;</SUP>to which he gave the name
"atoms." All of the Euclidean
geometry was based upon <I>axioms</I> rather than upon experimentally
redemonstrable
principles of physical behavior.

 Webster's dictionary defines <I>axiom</I> (etymologically
from the Greek "to think
worthy") as (1) a maxim widely accepted on its intrinsic
merit, and (2) a proposition
regarded as self-evident truth. The dictionary defines
<I>maxim</I> as (1) a general truth,
fundamental principle, or rule of conduct, and (2) a
saying of a proverbial nature. <I>Maxim</I>
and <I>maximum</I> possibly integratingly evolved as "the most
important axiom." Max +
axiom = maxim. The assumption of commonly honored, customarily
accredited axioms as
the fundamental "building-blocks" of Greek geometry
circumvented the ever-
experimentally-redemonstrable qualifying requirement
of all serious scientific
considerations.

 The Ionian Greeks assumed as fundamental geometric
components their line-
surrounded areas. These areas' surfaces could be rough,
smooth, or polished<SUP>&#95;&#95;</SUP>just as the
smooth surface of the water of the sea could be roughened
without losing its identity to
them as "the surface." Looking upon plane geometry as
the progenitor of subsequently-to-
be-developed solid geometry, it seemed never to have
occurred to the Euclideans that the
surface on which they scribed had shape integrity only
as a consequence of its being a
component of a complex polyhedral system, the system
itself consisting of myriads of
subvisible structural systems, whose a priori structural
integrity complex held constant the
shape of the geometrical figures they scribed upon<SUP>&#95;&#95;</SUP>the
polyhedral system, for instance,
the system planet Earth upon whose ground they scratched
their figures, or the stone
block, or the piece of bark on which they drew. Even
Democritus's brilliant speculative
thought of a minimum thing smaller than our subdimensional
but point-to-able speck was
speculative exploration a priori to any experimentally
induced thinking of complex
dynamic interactions of a plurality of forces that constituted
<I>structuring</I> in its most
primitive sense. Democritus did not think of the atom
as a kinetic complex of structural
shaping interactions of energy events operating at ultra-high-frequency
in pure principle.

stone columns were obviously perpendicular<SUP>&#95;&#95;</SUP>ergo, logically
parallel to one another.

 The Greeks' generalized geometry commenced with the
planar relationships
and developed therefrom a "solid" geometry by in effect
standing their planes on edge on
each of the four sides of a square base and capping
this vertical assembly with a square
plane. This structure was then subdivided by three interperpendicularly
coordinate
lines<SUP>&#95;&#95;</SUP>X, Y, and Z<SUP>&#95;&#95;</SUP>each with its corresponding sets of
modularly interspaced and
interparalleled planes. Each of these three sets of
interparallel and interperpendicular
planes was further subdivisible into modularly interspaced
and interparallel lines. Their sets
of interparallel and interperpendicular planar and linear
modulations also inherently
produced areal squares and volumetric cubes as the fundamental,
seemingly simplest
possible area-and-volume standards of uniform mensuration
whose dimensioning
increments were based exclusively on the uniform linear
module of the coordinate
system<SUP>&#95;&#95;</SUP>whose comprehensive interrelationship values
remained constant<SUP>&#95;&#95;</SUP>ergo, were
seemingly generalizable mathematically quite independently
of any special case experiential
selection of special case lengths to be identified with
the linear modules.

 The Euclidean Greeks assumed not only that the millions
of points and
instant planes existed independently of one another,
but that the complex was always the
product of endlessly multipliable simplexes<SUP>&#95;&#95;</SUP>to be furnished
by an infinite resource of
additional components. The persistence of the Greeks'
original misconceptioning of
geometry has also so distorted the conditioning of the
human brain-reflexing as to render
it a complete 20th-century surprise that we have a finite
Universe: a finite but nonunitarily-
and-nonsimultaneously accomplished, eternally regenerative
Scenario Universe. In respect
to such a scenario Universe multiplication is always
accomplished only by progressively
complex, but always rational, subdivisioning of the
initially simplest structural system of
Universe: the sizeless, timeless, generalized tetrahedron.
Universe, being finite, with
energy being neither created nor lost but only being
nonsimultaneously intertransformed,
cannot itself be multiplied. Multiplication is cosmically
accommodated only by further
subdivisioning.

 If the Greeks had tried to do so, they would soon have
discovered that they
could not join tetrahedra face-to-face to fill allspace;
whereas they could join cubes face-
to-face to fill allspace. Like all humans they were
innately intent upon finding the
"Building-Block" of Universe. The cube seemed to the
Greeks, the Mesopotamians, and
the Egyptians to be just what they needed to account
their experiences volumetrically. But
if they had tried to do so, they would have found that
unit-dimensioned tetrahedra could
be joined corner-to-corner only within the most compact
omnidirectional confine
permitted by the corner-to-corner rule, which would
have disclosed the constant
interspace form of the octahedron, which complements
the tetrahedron to fill allspace; had
they done so, the Ionians would have anticipated the
physicists' 1922 discovery of
"fundamental complementarity" as well as the 1956 Nobel-winning
physics discovery that
the complementarity does not consist of the mirror image
of that which it complements.
But the Greeks did not do so, and they tied up humanity's
accounting with the cube which
now, two thousand years later, has humanity in a lethal
bind of 99 percent scientific
illiteracy.

 In 1977 the NASA scientists scrutinized the robot-photographed
pictures of
the close-in Martian scene and reported the<SUP>&#95;&#95;</SUP>to them<SUP>&#95;&#95;</SUP>surprise
presence on Mars of two
(two-mile-base-edged) three-sided pyramids the size
of Mount Fuji. The NASA scientists
were unfamiliar with the tetrahedron. They remarked
that these forms, with whose
simplest, primitive character they were unacquainted,
must have been produced by wind-
blown sand erosion, whereas we have discovered that
tetrahedra are always and only a
priori to nature's processes of alteration of her simplest
and most primitive polyhedral
systems.

 Also suggestive of the same blindness to nature's reality
suffered by the
academic world and the scientists who lead it, was van't
Hoff's late 19th-century
identification of the primitive significance of the
tetrahedron in the structuring of organic
chemistry. (See Sec.
 <A HREF="p3000.html#931.60">931.60</A>.) His hypothesis was at
first scoffed at by scientists.
Fortunately, through the use of optical instruments
he was able to present visual proof of
the tetrahedral configuration of carbon bonds-which
experimentally reproduced evidence
won him the first Nobel prize awarded a chemist. The
Greeks of three millennia ago and
today's "educated" society are prone to assume that
nature is primitively disorderly and
that symmetrical shapes are accomplished only by human
contriving.
