 Recalling our discovery that angles, tetrahedra, and
topological
characteristics are system constants independent of
size, the limit of experimentally
demonstrable powering involves a constant vector equilibrium
and an isotropic vector
matrix whose omnisymmetrically interparalleled planes
and electable omniuniform
frequency reoccurrences accommodate in time-sizing everywhere
and anywhere
regenerative (symmetrically indestruct, tetrahedral,
four-dimensional, zerophase, i.e., the
vector equilibrium) rebirths of a constant, unit-angle,
structural system of convergent
gravitation and divergent radiation resonatability,
whose developed frequencies are the
specific, special-case, time-size dimensionings.

 Dimensional growth is not occasioned by an increase
in exponential powers.
It is brought about by increasing subdivision of the
constant whole of Universe to isolate a
locally considerable increment. For instance, E = Mc<SUP>2</SUP>
says that the amount of energy
involved in the isolated "mass" as a local event complex
of Universe under consideration
in this particular instance is to be determined by reference
to the constant amount of
cosmic energy involved in the constant rate of growth
of a spherical, electromagnetic,
wave surface, which constant is c<SUP>2</SUP>. Because the potential
energy is in vector equilibrium
packages, the centers of energy rebirth are accommodated
by the isotropic vector matrix.
The constant power is the frequency 10F<SUP>2</SUP> + 2, which
accommodates all the exportive-
importive, entropic-syntropic, regeneration patterning
of Universe.

 Newton's intermass attraction increases at the second
power as the time-
distance between is halved. Newton and Einstein deal
only with mass and frequency to the
second power. Their masses are relatively variable.
In one, mass is acceleratingly
expended; in the other, mass is acceleratingly collected.

plane defined by points ABC. With D
equidistant from A, B, and C, the volume of the regular
tetrahedron ABCD will not be
altered by letting D travel to any point in plane two
while point C travels to any point on
line two. Thus we learn that constant-volume tetrahedron
ABCD might become so
distended as to appear to be a line of no volume. Since
there could be no volumeless line

The centers of area of the triangular
faces are arrived at by bisecting the edges and connecting
the opposite angle. The center
of volume of the tetrahedron is arrived at by interconnecting
the four centers of triangular
area with their opposite vertexes. These four lines
constructed with fine, taut wires will
converge to tangency at<SUP>&#95;&#95;</SUP>and then diverge away from<SUP>&#95;&#95;</SUP>the

 The lines defining the center of four triangles and
the center of volume
inherently divide the modules into 24 equal parts. The
same progressive subdivisions of
the last 24 can be continued indefinitely, but each
time we do so the rational bits become
more and more asymmetrical. They get thinner and thinner
and become more and more
like glass splinters. By varying the frequency we can
make any shape tetrahedron from the
regular to the most asymmetric.

 When great electrostatic charges built into clouds
become dischargingly
grounded (to Earth) by the excellently-conducting water
of rain, and lightning occurs; we
see the Earthward, precessionally-branching lightning.
In grounding with Earth, lightning
often closes its circuit through the tree's branches,
whose liquid, water-filled, cell fibers
are the most efficient conductors available in conducting
the great electric charges inward
to Earth through the trunk and the precessionally-distributive
roots' branchings. Lines are
tetrahedra. Lines can wave-bounce in ribbons and beams:

 In synergetics there are four axial systems: ABCD.
There is a maximum set
of four planes nonparallel to one another but omnisymmetrically
mutually intercepting.
These are the four sets of the unique planes always
comprising the isotropic vector matrix.
The four planes of the tetrahedron can never be parallel
to one another. The synergetics
ABCD-four-dimensional and the conventional XYZ-three-dimensional
systems are
symmetrically intercoordinate. XYZ coordinate systems
cannot rationally accommodate
and directly articulate angular acceleration; and they
can only awkwardly, rectilinearly
articulate linear acceleration events.

the qualities of
experience, all aspects of being. Measurements of width,
breadth, and height are awkward,
inadequate descriptions that are only parts of the picture.
Without weight, you do not exist

You can convert the velocity-
times-mass into heat. Vectors are not abstractions,
they are resolutions. Time and heat and
length and weight are inherent in every dimension. Ergo,
time is no more the fourth
dimension than it is the first, second, or third dimension.

 Time is in synergetic dimensioning because our geometry
is vectorial. Every
vector = mass &#215; velocity, and time is a function of
velocity. The velocity can be inward,
outward, or around, and the arounding will always be
chordal and exactly equated with
the inwardness and outwardness time expendabilities.
The Euclidian-derived XYZ
coordinate geometry cannot express time equi-economically
around, but only time in and
time out. Synergetics inherently has time equanimity:
it deals with anything that exists
always in 1 &#215; 1 time coordination.
