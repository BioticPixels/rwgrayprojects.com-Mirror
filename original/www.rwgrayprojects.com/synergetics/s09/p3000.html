 Exploring the multiramifications of spontaneously
regenerative reangulations
and triangulations, we introduce upon a continuous ribbon
a 60-degree-patterned,
progressively alternating, angular bounce-off inwards
from first one side and then the
other side of the ribbon, which produces a wave pattern
whose length is the interval along
any one side between successive bounce-offs which, being
at 60 degrees in this case,
produces a series of equiangular triangles along the
strip. As seen from one side, the
equiangular triangles are alternately oriented as <I>peak
away,</I> then <I>base away,</I> then <I>peak
away</I> again, etc. This is the patterning of the only
equilibrious, never realized, angular field
state, in contradistinction to its sine-curve wave,
periodic realizations of progressively
accumulative, disequilibrious aberrations, whose peaks
and valleys may also be patterned
between the same length wave intervals along the sides
of the ribbon as that of the
equilibrious periodicity. (See Illus. 930.11.)

 <B>Pattern Strips Aggregate Wrapabilities:</B> The equilibrious
state's 60-
degree rise-and-fall lines may also become successive
cross-ribbon fold-lines, which, when
successively partially folded, will produce alternatively
a tetrahedral- or an octahedral- or
an icosahedral-shaped spool or reel upon which to roll-mount
itself repeatedly: the
tetrahedral spool having four successive equiangular
triangular facets around its equatorial
girth, with no additional triangles at its polar extremities;
while in the case of the
octahedral reel, it wraps closed only six of the eight
triangular facets of the octahedron,
which six lie around the octahedron's equatorial girth
with two additional triangles left
unwrapped, one each triangularly surrounding each of
its poles; while in the case of the
icosahedron, the equiangle-triangulated and folded ribbon
wraps up only 10 of the
icosahedron's 20 triangles, those 10 being the 10 that
lie around the icosahedron's
equatorial girth, leaving five triangles uncovered around
each of its polar vertexes. (See

 Thus we learn sum-totally how a ribbon (band) wave,
a waveband, can self-
interfere periodically to produce in-shuntingly all
the three prime structures of Universe
and a complex isotropic vector matrix of successively
shuttle-woven tetrahedra and
octahedra. It also illustrates how energy may be wave-shuntingly
self-knotted or self-
interfered with (see Sec.
 <A HREF="../s05/p0600.html#506.00">506</A>), and their energies impounded
in local, high-frequency
systems which we misidentify as only-seemingly-static
matter.

 <B>Single Bond:</B> In a single-bonded or univalent aggregate,
all the tetrahedra
are joined to one another by only one vertex. The connection
is like an electromagnetic
universal joint or like a structural engineering pin
joint; it can rotate in any direction
around the joint. The mutability of behavior of single
bonds elucidates the compressible
and load-distributing behavior of gases.

 <B>Quadrivalence of Energy Structures Closer-Than-Sphere
Packing:</B> In
1885, van't Hoff showed that all organic chemical structuring
is tetrahedrally configured
and interaccounted in vertexial linkage. A constellation
of tetrahedra linked together
entirely by such single-bonded universal jointing uses
lots of space, which is the openmost
condition of flexibility and mutability characterizing
the behavior of gases. The medium-
packed condition of a double-bonded, hinged arrangement
is still flexible, but sum-totally
as an aggregate, allspace-filling complex is noncompressible<SUP>&#95;&#95;</SUP>as
are liquids. The closest-
packing, triple-bonded, fixed-end arrangement corresponds
with rigid-structure molecular
compounds.

 The closest-packing concept was developed in respect
to spherical
aggregates with the convex and concave octahedra and
vector equilibria spaces between
the spheres. Spherical closest packing overlooks a much
closer packed condition of energy
structures, which, however, had been comprehended by
organic chemistry<SUP>&#95;&#95;</SUP>that of
quadrivalent and fourfold bonding, which corresponds
to outright congruence of the
octahedra or tetrahedra themselves. When carbon transforms
from its soft, pressed-cake,
carbon black powder (or charcoal) arrangement to its
diamond arrangement, it converts
from the so-called closest arrangement of triple bonding
to quadrivalence. We call this
self-congruence packing, as a single tetrahedron arrangement
in contradistinction to
closest packing as a neighboring-group arrangement of
spheres.

 Linus Pauling's X-ray diffraction analyses revealed
that all metals are
tetrahedrally organized in configurations interlinking
the gravitational centers of the
compounded atoms. It is characteristic of metals that
an alloy is stronger when the
different metals' unique, atomic, constellation symmetries
have congruent centers of
gravity, providing mid-edge, mid-face, and other coordinate,
interspatial accommodation

 One of the main characteristics of DNA is that we
have in its helix a
structural patterning instruction, all four-dimensional
patterning being controlled only by
frequency and angle modulatability. The coding of the
four principal chemical compounds,
GCTA, contains all the instructions for the designing
of all the patterns known to
biological life. These four letters govern the coding
of the life structures. With new life,
there is a parent-child code controls unzipping. There
is a dichotomy and the new life
breaks off from the old with a perfect imprint and control,
wherewith in turn to produce
and design others.

 The tetrahelix is a helical array of triple-bonded
tetrahedra. (See Illus. 933.01)
We have a column of tetrahedra with straight edges,
but when face-bonded to
one another, and the tetrahedra's edges are interconnected,
they altogether form a
hyperbolic-parabolic, helical column. The column spirals
around to make the helix, and it
takes just ten tetrahedra to complete one cycle of the
helix.

 Such tetrahelical columns may be made with regular
or irregular tetrahedral
components because the sum of the angles of a tetrahedron's
face will always be 720
degrees, whether regular or asymmetric. If we employed
asymmetric tetrahedra they
would have six different edge lengths, as would be the
case if we had four different

 This synergetics' tetrahelix is capable of demonstrating
the molecular-
compounding characteristic of the Watson-Crick model
of the DNA, that of the
deoxyribonucleic acid. When Drs. Watson, Wilkins, and
Crick made their famous model of
the DNA, they made a chemist's reconstruct from the
information they were receiving, but
not as a microscopic photograph taken through a camera.
It was simply a schematic
reconstruction of the data they were receiving regarding
the relevant chemical associating
and the disassociating. They found that a helix was
developing.

 They found there were 36 rotational degrees of arc
accomplished by each
increment of the helix and the 36 degrees aggregated
as 10 arc increments in every
complete helical cycle of 360 degrees. Although there
has been no identification of the
tetrahelix column of synergetics with the Watson-Crick
model, the numbers of the
increments are the same. Other molecular biologists
also have found a correspondence of
the tetrahelix with the structure used by some of the
humans' muscle fibers.

 When we address two or more positive or two or more
negative tetrahelixes
together, the positives nestle their angling forms into
one another, as the negatives nestle
likewise into one another's forms.

 <B>Closest Packing of Different-sized Balls:</B> It could
be that the CCTA
tetrahelix derives from the closest packing of different-sized
balls. The Mites and Sytes
(see Sec.
 <A HREF="p5100.html#953.00">953</A>) could be the
tetrahedra of the GCTA because
they are both positive-
negative and allspace filling.
