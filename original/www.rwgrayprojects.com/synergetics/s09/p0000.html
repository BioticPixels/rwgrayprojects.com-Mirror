 Synergetics is a book about models: humanly conceptual
models; lucidly
conceptual models; primitively simple models; rationally
intertransforming models; and the
primitively simple numbers uniquely and holistically
identifying those models and their

 The brain in its coordination of the sensing of each
special case experience
apprehends forms. Forms are special case. Models are
generalizations of interrelationships.
Models are inherently systemic. Forms are special case
systems. Mind can conceptualize
models. Brains can apprehend forms.

 The Basic Disequilibrium 120 LCD Spherical Triangle
of synergetics is
derived from the 15-great-circle, symmetric, three-way
grid of the spherical icosahedron.
It is the lowest common denominator of a sphere's surface,
being precisely 1/120th of that
surface as described by the icosahedron's 15 great circles.
The trigonometric data for the
Basic Disequilibrium LCD Triangle includes the data
for the entire sphere and is the basis
of all geodesic dome calculations.

 As seen in Sec.
<A HREF="../s06/p0900.html#610.20">610.20</A>
there are only three basic
structural systems in
Universe: the tetrahedron, octahedron, and icosahedron.
The largest number of equilateral
triangles in a sphere is 20: the spherical icosahedron.
Each of those 20 equiangular
spherical triangles may be subdivided equally into six
right triangles by the perpendicular
bisectors of those equiangular triangles. The utmost
number of geometrically similar
subdivisions is 120 triangles, because further spherical-triangular
subdivisions are no
longer similar. The largest number of similar triangles
in a sphere that spheric unity will
accommodate is 120: 60 positive and 60 negative. Being
spherical, they are positive and
negative, having only common arc edges which, being
curved, cannot hinge with one
another; when their corresponding angle-and-edge patterns
are vertex-mated, one bellies
away from the other: concave or convex. When one is
concave, the other is convex. (See
Illus.

 We cannot further subdivide the spherical icosahedron's
equiangular
triangles into similar, half-size, equiangular triangles,
but we can in the planar icosahedron.
When the sides of the triangle in the planar icosahedron
are bisected, four similar half-size
triangles result, and the process can be continued indefinitely.
But in the spherical
icosahedron, the smaller the triangle, the less the
spherical excess; so the series of triangles
will not be similar. Each corner of the icosahedron's
equiangular triangles is 72 degrees;
whereas the corners of its mid-edge-connecting triangle
are each approximately 63
degrees.

 When two great-circle geodesic lines cross, they form
two sets of similar
angles, any one of which, paired with the other, will
always add to 180<SUP>&ordm;</SUP>. (This we also
learned in plane geometry.) When any one great circle
enters into<SUP>&#95;&#95;</SUP>or exits from<SUP>&#95;&#95;</SUP>a
spherical triangle, it will form the two sets of similar
angles as it crosses the enclosing
great-circle-edge-lines of that triangle.

 As in billiards or in electromagnetics, when a ball
or a photon caroms off a

 If a great-circle-describing, inexhaustibly re-energized,
satellite ball that was
sufficiently resilient to remain corporeally integral,
were suddenly to encounter a vertical,
great-circle wall just newly mounted from its parent
planet's sphere, it would bounce
inwardly off that wall at the same angle that it would
have traversed the same great-circle
line had the wall not been there. And had two other
great-circle walls forming a right
spherical triangle with the first wall been erected
just as the resilient ball satellite was
hitting the first great-circle wall, then the satellite
ball would be trapped inside the
spherical-triangle-walled enclosure, and it would bounce
angularly off the successively
encountered walls in the similar-triangle manner unless
it became aimed either at a corner
vertex of the triangular wall trap, or exactly perpendicularly
to the wall, in either of which
cases it would be able to escape into the next spherical
area Lying 180<SUP>&ordm;</SUP>  ahead outside the
first triangle's walls.

happened to be dimensioned as one
of the 120 LCD right triangles of the spherical icosahedron)
great-circle walls representing

around within one such spherical

 For this reason the great-circle interior mapping
of the symmetrically
superimposed other sets of 10 and 6 great circles, each
of which<SUP>&#95;&#95;</SUP>together with the 15
original great circles of the icosahedron<SUP>&#95;&#95;</SUP>produces the

These

sphere may thus be

systems of Universe (see Sec.
<A HREF="../s06/p0900.html#610.20">610.20</A>)
<SUP>&#95;&#95;</SUP>required the least energetic, vectorial, structural
investment per volume of
enclosed local Universe, that led to the development
of the Basic Disequilibrium 120 LCD
Spherical Triangle and its multifrequenced triangular
subdivisioning as the basis for
calculating all highfrequency, triangulated, spherical
structures and structural subportions
of spheres; for within only one disequilibrious LCD
triangle were to be found all the
spherical chord-factor constants for any desired radius
of omnisubtriangulated spherical
structure.

 In the same way it was discovered that local, chord-compression
struts could
be islanded from one another, and could be only tensionally
and non-inter-shearingly
connected to produce stable and predictably efficient
enclosures for any local energetic
environment valving uses whatsoever by virtue of the

 Because the 120 basic disequilibrious LCD triangles
of the icosahedron have
2 l/2 times less spherical excess than do the 48 basic
equilibrious LCD triangles of the
vector equilibrium, and because all physical realizations
are always disequilibrious, the
Basic Disequilibrium 120 LCD Spherical Triangles become
most realizably basic of all

 The spherical surface angle BCE is exactly equal to
two of the arc edges of
the Basic Disequilibrium 120 LCD Triangle measured by
their central angle. BCE = arc
AC = arc CF = 20&deg; 54' 18.57".

 <B>Surface Angles and Central Angles:</B> The Basic Triangle
ACB can be
folded on the lines CD and CE and EF. We may then bring
AC to coincide with CF and
fold BEF down to close the tetrahedron, with B congruent
with D because the arc DE =
arc EB and arc BF = arc AD. Then the tetrahedron's corner
C will fit exactly down into
the central angles AOC, COB, and AOB. (See Illus.

 As you go from one sphere-foldable great-circle set
to another in the
hierarchy of spinnable symmetries (the 3-, 4-, 6-, 12-sets
of the vector equilibrium's 25-
great-circle group and the 6-, 10-, 15-sets of the icosahedron's
31-great-circle group), the
central angles of one often become the surface angles
of the next-higher-numbered, more
complex, great-circle set while simultaneously some
(but not all) of the surface angles
become the respective next sphere's central angles.
A triangle on the surface of the
icosahedron folds itself up, becomes a tetrahedron,
and plunges deeply down into the
congruent central angles' void of the icosahedron (see
Sec.
 <A HREF="p0500.html#905.47">905.47</A>
).

 There is only one noncongruence- the last would-be
hinge, EF is an external
arc and cannot fold as a straight line; and the spherical
surface angle EBF is 36 degrees
whereas a planar 30 degrees is called for if the surface
is cast off or the arc subsides
chordally to fit the 90-60-30 right plane triangle.

 The 6 degrees of spherical excess is a beautiful whole,
rational number
excess. The 90-degree and 60-degree corners seem to
force all the excess into one corner,
which is not the way spherical triangles subside. All
the angles lose excess in proportion to
their interfunctional values. This particular condition
means that the 90 degrees would
shrink and the 60 degrees would shrink. I converted
all the three corners into seconds and
began a proportional decrease study, and it was there
that I began to encounter a ratio that
seemed rational and had the number 31 in one corner.
This seemed valid as all the
conditions were adding up to 180 degrees or 90 degrees
as rational wholes even in both
spherical and planar conditions despite certain complementary
transformations. This led to
the intuitive identification of the Basic Disequilibrium
120 LCD Triangle's foldability (and
its fall-in-ability into its own tetra-void) with the
A Quanta Module, as discussed in Sec.
