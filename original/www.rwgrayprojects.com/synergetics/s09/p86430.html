 The rhombic dodecahedron has an allspace-filling function
as the domain of
any one sphere in an aggregate of unit-radius, closest-packed
spheres; its 12 mid-diamond-
face points C are the points of intertangency of all
unit-radius, closest-packed sphere
aggregates; wherefore that point C is the midpoint of
every vector of the isotropic vector
matrix, whose every vertex is the center of one of the

 We next discover that two ABABO pentahedra of any two
tangentially
adjacent, closest-packed rhombic dodecahedra will produce
an asymmetric octahedron
OABABO' with O and O' being the volumetric centers (nuclear
centers) of any two
tangentially adjacent, closest-packed, unit-radius spheres.
We call this nucleus-to-nucleus,
asymmetric octahedron the Coupler, and we found that
the volume of the Coupler is
exactly equal to the volume of one regular tetrahedron<SUP>&#95;&#95;</SUP>i.e.,
24 A Quanta Modules. We
also note that the Coupler always consists of eight
asymmetric and identical tetrahedral
Mites, the minimum simplex allspace-filling of Universe,
which Mites are also identifiable
with the quarks (Sec.

 We then discover that the Mite, with its two energy-conserving
A Quanta
Modules and its one energy-dispersing B Quanta Module
(for a total combined volume of
three quanta modules), serves as the cosmic minimum
allspace-filler, corresponding
elegantly (in all ways) with the minimum-limit case
behaviors of the nuclear physics'
quarks. The quarks are the smallest discovered "particles";
they always occur in groups of
three, two of which hold their energy and one of which
disperses energy. This quite clearly
identifies the quarks with the quanta module of which
all the synergetics hierarchy of
nuclear concentric symmetric polyhedra are co-occurrent.

 With this information we could reasonably hypothesize
that the
triacontahedron of tetravolume 5 is that static polyhedral
progenitor of the only-
dynamically-realizable sphere of tetravolume 5, the
radius of which (see Fig.
 <A HREF="p86310.html#986.314">986.314</A>) is
only 0.04 of unity greater in length than is the prime
vector radius OC, which governs the
dimensioning of the triacontahedron's 30 midface cases
of 12 right-angled corner
junctions around mid-diamond-vertex C, which provides
the 12 right angles around C-the
four right-angled corners of the T Quanta Module's ABC
faces of their 120 radially
arrayed tetrahedra, each of which T Quanta Module has
a volume identical to that of the A
and B Quanta Modules.

 We also note that the radius OC is the same unitary
prime vector with which
the isotropic vector matrix is constructed, and it is
also the VE unit-vector-radius distance
outwardly from O, which O is always the common system
center of all the members of the
entire cosmic hierarchy of omniconcentric, symmetric,
primitive polyhedra. In the case of
the rhombic triacontahedron the 20 OA lines' distances
outwardly from O are greater than
OC, and the 12 OB lines' distances are even greater
in length outwardly from O than OA.
Wherefore I realized that, when dynamically spun, the
greatcircle chord lines AB and CB
are centrifugally transformed into arcs and thus sprung
apart at B, which is the outermost
vertex<SUP>&#95;&#95;</SUP>ergo, most swiftly and forcefully outwardly impelled.
This centrifugal spinning
introduces the spherical excess of 6 degrees at the
spherical system vertex B. (See Fig.
<A HREF="p86310.html#986.405">986.405</A>)
 Such yielding increases the spheric appearance of
the spun triacontahedron, as
seen in contradistinction to the diamond-faceted, static,
planar-bound, polyhedral state
aspect.

 The corners of the spherical triacontahedron's 120
spherical arc-cornered
triangles are 36 degrees, 60 degrees and 90 degrees,
having been sprung apart from their
planar-phase, chorded corners of 31.71747441 degrees,
58.28252559 degrees, and 90
degrees, respectively. Both the triacontahedron's chorded
and arced triangles are in
notable proximity to the well-known 30-, 60-, and 90-degree-cornered
draftsman's flat,
planar triangle. I realized that it could be that the
three sets of three differently-distanced-
outwardly vertexes might average their outward-distance
appearances at a radius of only
four percent greater distance from O-thus producing
a moving-picture-illusioned
"dynamic" sphere of tetravolume 5, having very mildly
greater radius than its static,
timeless, equilibrious, rhombic triacontahedron state
of tetravolume 5 with unit-vector-

 What is the significance of the spherical excess of
exactly 6 degrees? In the
transformation from the spherical rhombic triacontahedron
to the planar triacontahedron
each of the 120 triangles releases 6 degrees. 6 &#215; 120
= 720. 720 degrees = the sum of the
structural angles of one tetrahedron = 1 quantum of
energy. The difference between a
high-frequency polyhedron and its spherical counterpart
is always 720 degrees, which is
one unit of quantum<SUP>&#95;&#95;</SUP>ergo, it is evidenced that spinning
a polyhedron into its spherical
state captures one quantum of energy<SUP>&#95;&#95;</SUP>and releases it
when subsiding into its pre-time-
size primitive polyhedral state.

 A series of considerations leads to the definition
of the most spherical-
appearing limit of triangular subdivisioning:
<OL TYPE="1">
<LI> recalling that the experimentally demonstrable "most
spherically-appearing"
structure is always in primitive reality a polyhedron;
<LI> recalling that the higher the modular frequency
of a system the more spheric it
appears, though it is always polyhedral and approaching
not a "true sphere"
limit but an unlimited multiplication of its polyhedral
facetings;
<LI> recalling that the 120 outer surface triangles of
the icosahedron's 15 great
circles constitute the cosmic maximum limit of system-surface
omni-triangular-
self-subdivisioning into centrally collected tetrahedron
components; and
<LI> recalling that the icosahedron's 10- and 6-great-circle
equators of spin further
subdivide the 15 great circles' outer 120 LCD triangles
into four different right
triangles, ADC, CDE, CFE, and EFB (see Fig.
 <A HREF="p0000.html#901.03">901.03</A>),
</OL>
<I>then</I> it becomes evident that the icosahedron's three
sets of symmetrical greatcircle
spinnabilities<SUP>&#95;&#95;</SUP>i.e., 6 + 10 + 15 (which totals 31 great
circle self-halvings)<SUP>&#95;&#95;</SUP>generate a
total of 242 unit-radius, external vertexes, 480 external
triangles, and 720 internal triangles
(which may be considered as two congruent internal triangles,
each being one of the
internal triangular faces of the 480 tetrahedra whose
480 external triangular faces are
showing-in which case there are 1440 internal triangles).
The 480 tetrahedra consist of
120 OCAD, 120 OCDE, 120 OCEF, and 120 OFEB tetrahedra.
(See Fig.
 <A HREF="p86430.html#986.471">986.471</A>.) The
480 internal face-congruent tetrahedra therefore constitute
the "most spheric-appearing"
of all the hemispheric equators' self-spun, surface-subdividing
entirely into triangles of all
the great circles of all the primitive hierarchy of
symmetric polyhedra.

 In case one thinks that the four symmetrical sets of
the great circles of the
spherical VE (which total 25 great circles in all) might
omnisubdivide the system surface
exclusively into a greater number of triangles, we note
that some of the subdivision areas
of the 25 great circles are not triangles (see quadrant
BCEF in Fig.
 <A HREF="../s04/p5300.html#453.01">453.01</A>
<SUP>&#95;&#95;</SUP>third printing
of <I>Synergetics 1</I><SUP>&#95;&#95;</SUP>of which quadrangles there are a total
of 48 in the system); and note
that the total number of triangles in the 25-great-circle
system is 288<SUP>&#95;&#95;</SUP>ergo, far less than
the 31 great circles' 480 spherical right triangles;
ergo, we become satisfied that the
icosahedron's set of 480 is indeed the cosmic maximum-limit
case of system-self-spun
subdivisioning of its self into tetrahedra, which 480
consist of four sets of 120 similar
tetrahedra each.

 It then became evident (as structurally demonstrated
in reality by my
mathematically close-toleranced geodesic domes) that
the spherical trigonometry
calculations' multifrequenced modular subdividing of
only one of the icosahedron's 120
spherical right triangles would suffice to provide all
the basic trigonometric data for any
one and all of the unit-radius vertex locations and
their uniform interspacings and
interangulations for any and all frequencies of modular
subdividings of the most

of Universe, the only

of the special-case system being

 This surmise regarding nature's most-economical, least-effort
design
strategy has been further verified by nature's own use
of the same geodesics mathematics
as that which I discovered and employed in my domes.
Nature has been using these
mathematical principles for eternity. Humans were unaware
of that fact. I discovered these
design strategies only as heretofore related, as an
inadvertent by-product of my
deliberately undertaking to find nature's coordination
system. That nature was manifesting
icosahedral and VE coordinate patterning was only discovered
by other scientists after I
had found and demonstrated geodesic structuring, which
employed the synergetics'
coordinate-system strategies. This discovery by others
that my discovery of geodesic
mathematics was also the coordinate system being manifest
by nature occurred after I had
built hundreds of geodesic structures around the world
and their pictures were widely
published. Scientists studying X-ray diffraction patterns
of protein shells of viruses in 1959
found that those shells disclosed the same patterns
as those of my widely publicized
geodesic domes. When Dr. Aaron Klug of the University
of London<SUP>&#95;&#95;</SUP>who was the one
who made this discovery<SUP>&#95;&#95;</SUP>communicated with me, I was
able to send him the
mathematical formulae for describing them. Klug explained
to me that my geodesic
structures are being used by nature in providing the
"spherical" enclosures of her own
most critical design-controlling programming devices
for realizing all the unique
biochemical structurings of all biology<SUP>&#95;&#95;</SUP>which device
is the DNA helix.

 The structuring of biochemistry is epitomized in the
structuring of the
protein shells of all the viruses. They are indeed all
icosahedral geodesic structures. They
embracingly guard all the DNA-RNA codified programming
of all the angle-and-frequency
designing of all the biological, life-accommodating,
life-articulating structures. We find
nature employing synergetics geometry, and in particular
the high-frequency geodesic
"spheres," in many marine organisms such as the radiolaria
and diatoms, and in structuring
such vital organs as the male testes, the human brain,
and the eyeball. All of these are
among many manifests of nature's employment on her most
critically strategic occasions
of the most cosmically economical, structurally effective
and efficient enclosures, which
we find are always mathematically based on multifrequency
and three-way-triangular
gridding of the "spherical"<SUP>&#95;&#95;</SUP>because high-frequenced<SUP>&#95;&#95;</SUP>icosahedron,
octahedron, or
tetrahedron.

 Comparing the icosahedron, octahedron, and tetrahedron-the
icosahedron
gives the most volume per unit weight of material investment
in its structuring; the high-
frequency tetrahedron gives the greatest strength per
unit weight of material invested; and
the octahedron affords a happy<SUP>&#95;&#95;</SUP>but not as stable-mix
of the two extremes, for the
octahedron consists of the prime number 2, 2<SUP>2</SUP> = 4; whereas
the tetrahedron is the odd
prime number 1 and the icosahedron is the odd prime
number 5. Gear trains of even
number reciprocate, whereas gear trains of an odd number
of gears always lock; ergo, the
tetrahedral and icosahedral geodesic systems lock-fasten
all their structural systems, and
the octahedron's compromise, middle-position structuring
tends to yield transformingly
toward either the tetra or the icosa locked-limit capabilities<SUP>&#95;&#95;</SUP>either
of which tendencies is
pulsatively propagative.
