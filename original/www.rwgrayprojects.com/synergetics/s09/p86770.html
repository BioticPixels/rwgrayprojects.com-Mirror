 Thus far we have discovered the physical modelability
of Einstein's equation
and the scientific discovery of the modelability of
the transformation from matter to
radiation, as well as the modelability of the difference
between waves and particles. In our
excitement over these discoveries we forget that others
may think synergetics to be
manifesting only pure coincidence of events in a pure-scientists'
assumed-to-be model-less
world of abstract mathematical expressions, a world
of meaningless but alluring, simple
geometrical relationships. Hoping to cope with such
skepticism we introduce here three
very realistic models whose complex but orderly accounting
refutes any suggestion of
their being three successive coincidences, all occurring
in the most elegantly elementary
field of human exploration-that of the periodic table
of unique number behaviors of the
proton and neutron populations in successive stages
of the complexity of the chemical
elements themselves.

 (<I>Synergetics 1</I>), which shows
the three successive
layers of closest-packed spheres around the prime nuclear
sphere, we find the successive
layer counts to be 12, 42, 92 . . . that is, they are
"frequency to the second power times 10
plus 2." While we have been aware for 40 years that
the outermost layer of these

which 146 is the number of neutrons in uranium, and
uranium is the 92nd element<SUP>&#95;&#95;</SUP>as
with all elements, it combines its total of inner-layer
neutrons with its outer-layer protons.
In this instance of uranium we have combined the 149

238, from which count we can knock out four neutrons
from eight of the triangular faces
without disturbing symmetry to give us Uranium-234.

 Recently, however, a scientist who had been studying
synergetics and
attending my lectures called my attention to the fact
that the first closest-packed layer 12
around the nuclear sphere and the second embracing closest-packed
layer of 42 follow the
same neutron count, combining with the outer layer number
of protons<SUP>&#95;&#95;</SUP>as in the 92
uranium-layer case<SUP>&#95;&#95;</SUP>to provide a physically conceptual

 Sum-totally we can say that the curve of such events
suggests that in the
coming decades science in general will have discovered
that synergetics is indeed the
omnirational, omniconceptual, multialternatived, omnioptimally-efficient,
and always
experimentally reevidenceable, comprehensive coordinate

 Inspired by the E=Mc<SUP>2</SUP> modelability, I did more retrospective
reconsideration of what I have been concerned with mathematically
throughout my life.
This reviewing led me to (1) more discoveries, clarifications,
and definitions regarding
spheres; (2) the discard of the concept of axioms; and
(3) the dismissal of three-
dimensional reality as being inherently illusory<SUP>&#95;&#95;</SUP>and
the discard of many of mathematics'
abstract devices as being inherently "roundabout," "obscurational,"
and "inefficient."

Sizing requires
time. Time is a cosmically designed consequence of humanity's

innate <I>slowness</I> of apprehension and comprehension, which

 Academic thought, overwhelmed by the admitted observational
inexactitude
of special case human-brain-sense experiences, in developing
the particular logic of
academic geometry (Euclidean or non-Euclidean), finds
the term "identical" to be logically
prohibited and adopts the word "similar" to identify
<I>like</I> geometrical entities. In
synergetics, because of its clearly defined differences
between generalized primitive
conceptuality and special-case time-size realizations,
the word "identical" becomes
logically permitted. This is brought about by the difference
between the <I>operational</I>
procedures of synergetics and the <I>abstract</I> procedures
of all branches of conventional
geometry, where the word "abstract" deliberately means
"nonoperational," because only
axiomatic and non-physically-demonstrable.

 In conventional geometry the linear characteristics
and the relative sizes of
lines dominate the conceptioning and its nomenclature-as,
for instance, using the term
"equiangular" triangle because only lengths or sizes
of lines vary in time. Lines are
unlimited in size and can be infinitely extended, whereas
angles are discrete fractions of a
discrete whole circle. Angles are angles independently
of the lengths of their edges. (See
Sec.
 <A HREF="../s05/p1500.html#515.10">515.10</A>.)
 Lengths are always special time-size cases:
angles are eternally
generalized.... We can say with scientific accuracy:
"identical equiangular triangles." (See

 In summary, lines are "size" phenomena and are unlimited
in length. Size
measuring requires "time." Primitive synergetics deals
only in angles, which are inherently
whole fractions of whole circular azimuths.

 Synergetics procedure is always from a given whole
to the particular
fractional angles of the whole system considered. Synergetics
employs multiplication only
by division.... only by division of finite but non-unitarily-conceptual
Scenario Universe,
subdivided into initially whole primitive systems that
divide whole Universe into all the
Universe outside the system, all the Universe inside
the system, and the little bit of
Universe that provides the relevant set of special case

 Because the proofs in conventional geometry depend
on a plurality of
divider-stepped-off lengths between scribed, punched,
or pricked indefinably sized point-
speck holes, and because the lengths of the straightedge-drawn
lines are extendible
without limit, conventional geometry has to assume that
any two entities will never be
exactly the same. Primitive synergetics has only one
length: that of the prime unit vector of
the VE and of the isotropic vector matrix.

 Synergetics identifies all of its primitive hierarchy
and their holistic
subdivisions only by their timeless-sizeless relative
angular fractional subdivisions of six
equiangular triangles surrounding a point, which hexagonal
array equals 360 degrees, if
we assume that the three angles of the equiangular triangle
always add up to 180 degrees.
Synergetics conducts all of its calculations by spherical
trigonometry and deals always
with the central and surface angles of the primitive
hierarchy of pre-time-size relationships
of the symmetrically concentric systems around any nucleus
of Universe<SUP>&#95;&#95;</SUP>and their seven
great-circle symmetries of the 25 and 31 great-circle
systems (Sec.
 <A HREF="../s10/p3363.html#1040.00">1040</A>). The foldability
of the four great-circle planes demonstrates the four
sets of hexagons omnisurrounding the
cosmic nucleus in omni-60-degree angular symmetry. This
we call the VE. (See Sec.
 <A HREF="../s08/p4000.html#840.00">840</A>.)
Angular identities may be operationally assumed to be
identical: There is only one
equiangular triangle, all of its angles being 60 degrees.
The 60-ness comes from the 60
positive and 60 negative, maximum number of surface
triangles or T Quanta Modules per
cosmic system into which convergent-divergent nuclear
unity may be subdivided. The
triangle, as physically demonstrated by the tube necklace
polygons (Sec.
 <A HREF="../s06/p0000.html#608.00">608</A>), is the only
self-stabilizing structure, and the equiangular triangle
is the most stable of all triangular
structures. Equiangular triangles may be calculatingly
employed on an "identical" basis.

 The sphere is only dynamically developed either by

multiplication of uniformly radiused exterior vertexes
of ever-higher frequency of modular
subdivisioning of the primitive system's initial symmetry
of exterior topology. Such

of modular subdivisioning, or
high frequency of revolution, can transform any one

timeless) hierarchy of successive = 2&frac12, 1, 2&frac12;,
3, 4, 5, 6-tetravolumed concentrically
symmetric polyhedra into quasispherical appearances.
In respect to each such ever-higher

 The volume of a static quasisphere of unit vector length
(radius = l) is 4.188.
Each quasisphere is subexistent because it is not as
yet spun and there is as yet no time in
which to spin it. Seeking to determine anticipatorily
the volumetric value of the as-yet-
only-potential sphere's as-yet-to-be-spun domain (as
recounted in Secs.
 <A HREF="p86200.html#986.206">986.206-214</A>), I
converted my synergetics constant 1.0198255 to its ninth
power, as already recounted and
as intuitively motivated to accommodate the energetic
factors involved, which gave me the
number 1.192 (see Sec.
 <A HREF="p8220.html#982.55">982.55</A>), and with this ninth-powered
constant multiplied the
incipient sphere's already-third-powered volume of 4.188,
which produced the twelfth-
powered value 4.99206, which seems to tell us that synergetics'
experimentally
evidenceable only-by-high-frequency-spinning polyhedral
sphere has an unattainable but
ever-more-closely-approached limit tetravolume-5.000
(alpha) with however a physically
imperceptible 0.007904 volumetric shortfall of tetravolume-5,
the limit 4.99206 being the
maximum attainable twelfth-powered dynamism<SUP>&#95;&#95;</SUP>being a
sphericity far more perfect than
that of any of the planets or fruits or any other of
nature's myriads of quasispheres, which
shortfallers are the rule and not the exceptions. The
primitively nonconceptual, only-
incipient sphere's only-potentially-to-be-demonstrated
domain, like the square root of
minus one, is therefore a useful, approximate-magnitude,
estimating tool, but it is not
structurally demonstrable. The difference in magnitude
is close to that of the T and E
Quanta Modules.

 A special case is time-size. Generalization is eternal
and is independent of
time-size "Spheres," whether as independent bubbles,
as highfrequency geodesic
polyhedral structures, or as dynamically spun primitive
polyhedra, are always and only
special case time-size (frequency) physical phenomena.
The omnirational primitive-
numbered-tetravolume-interrelationships hierarchy of
concentric symmetric polyhedra is
the only generalized conceptuality that is both physical
and metaphysical. This is to say
that the prime number and relative abundance characteristics
of the topology, angulation,
and the relative tetravolume involvements of the primitive
hierarchy are generalized,
conceptual metaphysics. Physically evidenced phenomena
are always special case, but in
special cases are manifests of generalized principles,
which generalized principles
themselves are also always metaphysical.

<I>dimension,</I> which suggests (a) special case time-size

and not as part of a minimum system,
which is always a part of a priori eternally regenerative

adopting words to describe time-size

as event complexes, as structural
selfstabilizations, and structural intertransformings
as first, second, third, etc., local
powering states and minimum local systemic involvement
with conditions of the cosmic

 In addition to the 12-powered primitive structurings
of the positive and
negative primitive tetrahedron, the latter has its primitive
hierarchy of six
intertransformable, tetravolumed, symmetrical integrities
which require six additional
powerings to produce the six rational-valued, relative-volumetric
domains. In addition to
this 18-powered state of the primitive hierarchy we
discover the integrally potential six-
way intertransformabilities of the primitive hierarchy,
any one of which requires an
additional powering factor, which brings us thus far
to 24 powering states. Realization of
the intertransformings requires time-size, special case,

 High-frequency, triangulated unit-radius-vertexed,
geodesically interchorded,
spherical polyhedral apparencies are also structural
developments in time-size. There are
therefore two kinds of spherics: the highfrequency-event-stabilized,
geodesic, structural

"apparent" spheres. The static,
structural, multifaceted, polyhedral, geodesic sphere's
vertexes are uniformly radiused
only by the generalized vector, whereas the only superficially
spun and only apparently
profiled spheres have a plurality of vertexial distances
outward from their systemic center,
some of which distances are greater than unit vector
radius while some of the vertexes are
at less than unit vector radius distance. (See Fig.

 Among the symmetrical polyhedra having a tetravolume
of 5 and also having
radii a little more or a little less than that of unit
vector radius, are the icosahedron and the
enenicontahedron whose mean radii of spherical profiling
are less than four percent
vector-aberrant. There is, however, one symmetrical
primitive polyhedron with two sets of
its vertexes at greater than unit radius distance outwardly
from their system's nucleic
center; that is the rhombic dodecahedron, having, however,
a tetravolume of 6. The
rhombic dodecahedron's tetravolume of 6 may account
for the minimum intersystemness
in pure principle, being the space between omni-closest-packed
unit-radius spheres and the
spheres themselves. And then there is one symmetric
primitive polyhedron having a
volume of exactly tetravolume 5 and an interpattern
radius of 0.9995 of one unit vector;
this is the T Quanta Module phase rhombic triacontahedron.
There is also an additional
rhombic triacontahedron of exact vector radius and a
tetravolume of 5.007758031, which
is just too much encroachment upon the rhombic dodecahedron
6 minus the
triacontahedron 5 <IMG SRC="../figs/rparrow.gif"> 6 - 5 = 1,

 All the hierarchy of primitive polyhedra were developed
by progressive
great-circle-spun hemispherical halvings of halvings
and trisectings of halvings and
quintasectings (see Sec.
 <A HREF="../s01/p0000.html#100.1041">100.1041</A>) of halvings of the
initial primitive tetrahedron itself.
That the rhombic triacontahedron of contact-facet radius
of unit vector length had a
trigonometrically calculated volume of 4.998 proved
in due course not to be a residual
error but the "critical difference" between matter and
radiation. This gives us delight in the
truth whatever it may be, recalling that all the discoveries
of this chronicle chapter were
consequent only to just such faith in the truth, no
matter how initially disturbing to
misinformed and misconditioned reflexes it may be.

and in the Couplers, permit us
to consider a wide spectrum of complexedly reorientable

intermodular behavioral proclivities Lying in proximity
to one another between the
extreme radiational or gravitational proclivities, and
all the reorientabilities operative
within the same superficially observed space (Sec.

All these large numbers of
potential alternatives of behavioral proclivities may
