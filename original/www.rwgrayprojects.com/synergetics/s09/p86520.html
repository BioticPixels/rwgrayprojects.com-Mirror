 Remembering that in any given dimensional system of
reference the vector's
length represents a given mass multiplied by a given
velocity, we have in the present
instance the physical evidence that the surface area
of the T Quanta Module tetrahedron
exactly equals the area of the edge length<SUP>&#95;&#95;</SUP>0.9995<SUP>&#95;&#95;</SUP>"squared."
In this case of the T
Quanta Module the edge length of 0.9995 of the foldable
square (the visibly undetectable)
is 0.0005 less than the length of the prime vector of
1.000.

 The generalized isotropic vector matrix's prime vector
to the second
power<SUP>&#95;&#95;</SUP>"squared"<SUP>&#95;&#95;</SUP>becomes physically visible in the folded-square
T tetra modules. (Try
making one of them yourself.) This visible "squaring"
of the surface area of the exactly
one-energy-quantum module tetrahedron corresponds geometrically
to what is
symbolically called for in Einstein's equation, which
language physics uses as a
nonengineering-language symbolism (as with conventional
mathematics), and which does
not preintermultiply mass and velocity to produce a
vector of given length and angular
direction-ergo, does not employ the integrated vectorial
component VE<SUP>&#95;&#95;</SUP>ergo, must
express V<SUP>2</SUP> in separate components as M (mass) times
the velocity of energy unfettered in
vacuo to the second power, c<SUP>2</SUP>. However, we can say
Mc<SUP>2</SUP> = V<SUP>2</SUP>, the engineering
expression V2 being more economical. When T = the T
Quanta Module, and when the T
Quanta Module = one energy quantum module, we can say:

 In the Einstein equation the velocity<SUP>&#95;&#95;</SUP>lower-case c<SUP>&#95;&#95;</SUP>of
all radiation taken to
the second power is omnidirectional-ergo, its quasispheric
surface-growth rate is at the

 With all the foregoing holding true and being physically
demonstrable, we
find the vector minus 0.0005 of its full length producing
an exactly square area that folds
into a tetrahedron of exactly one quantum module, but,
we must remember, with a unit-
integral-square-surface area whose edge length is 0.0005
less than the true V<SUP>2</SUP> vector, i.e.,
less than Mc<SUP>2</SUP>. But don't get discouraged; as with the
French <I>Vive la Diff‚rence,</I> we find
that difference of 0.0005 to be of the greatest possible
significance . . . as we shall

 Now, reviewing and consolidating our physically exploratory
gains, we note
that in addition to the 0.9995 V<SUP>2</SUP>-edged "square"-surfaced
T Quanta Module tetrahedron
of exactly the same volume as the A, B, C, or D Quanta
Modules, we also have the E
Quanta Module<SUP>&#95;&#95;</SUP>or the "Einstein Module" <SUP>&#95;&#95;</SUP>whose square
edge is exactly vector V =
1.0000 (alpha), but whose volume is 1.001551606 when the A
Quanta Module's volume is
exactly 1.0000 (alpha), which volume we have also learned
is uncontainable by chemical
structuring, bonding, and the mass-attraction law.

 When the prime-unit vector constitutes the radial distance
outward from the
triacontahedron's volumetric center O to the mid-points
C of each of its mid-diamond
faces, the volume of the rhombic triacontahedron is
then slightly greater than tetravolume
5, being actually tetravolume 5.007758031. Each of the
rhombic triacontahedron's 120
internally structured tetrahedra is called an E Quanta
Module, the "E" for Einstein, being
the transformation threshold between energy convergently
self-interfering as matter = M,
and energy divergently dispersed as radiation = c<SUP>2</SUP>.
Let us consider two rhombic
triacontahedra: (1) one of radius 0.9995 V of exact
tetravolume 5; and (2) one of radius
1.0000 (alpha) of tetravolume 5.007758031. The exact prime-vector
radius 1.0000 (alpha) rhombic
triacontahedron volume is 0.007758031 (1/129th) greater
than the tetravolume 5<SUP>&#95;&#95;</SUP>i.e.,
tetravolume 5.007758031. This means that each E Quanta
Module is 1.001551606 when
the A Quanta Module is 1.0000.

 The 0.000517 radius difference between the 0.999483-radiused
rhombic
triacontahedron of exactly tetravolume 5 and its exquisitely
minute greater radius-1.0000
(alpha) prime vector, is the exquisite difference between
a local-in-Universe energy-containing
module and that same energy being released to become
energy radiant. Each of the 120
right-angle-cornered T Quanta Modules embraced by the
tetravolume-5 rhombic
triacontahedron is volumetrically identical to the A
and B Quanta Modules, of which the A
Modules hold their energy and the B Modules release
their energy (Sec.
 <A HREF="p2000.html#920.00">920</A>). Each quanta
module volume is 0.04166<SUP>&#95;&#95;</SUP>i.e., 1/24 of one regular primitive
tetrahedron, the latter we
recall being the minimum symmetric structural system
of Universe. To avoid decimal
fractions that are not conceptually simple, we multiply
all the primitive hierarchy of
symmetric, concentric, polyhedral volumes by 24<SUP>&#95;&#95;</SUP>after
which we can discuss and
consider energetic-synergetic geometry in always-whole-rational-integer

 To discover the significance of the "difference" all
we have to do is make
another square with edge length of exactly 1.000 (alpha) (a
difference completely invisible at
our one-foot-to-the-edge modeling scale), and now our
tetrahedron folded out of the
model is an exact geometrical model of Einstein's E
= Mc<SUP>2</SUP>, which, expressed in vectorial
engineering terms, reads E = V<SUP>2</SUP> ; however, its volume
is now 0.000060953 greater than
that of one exact energy quanta module. We call this
tetrahedron model folded from one
square whose four edge lengths are each exactly one
vector long the E Module, naming it
for Einstein. It is an exact vector model of his equation.

 The volumetric difference between the T Module and

difference between energy-as-matter and energy-as-radiation.
The linear growth of 0.0005

(the physicists' <I>particle</I>) from
matter into one minimum-limit "photon" of radiant energy
as light or any other radiation

<I>it is matter</I> or <I>it is radiation</I>....
Vastly enlarged, it is the same kind of difference existing

it reached the critical limit of

 The difference between the edge length of the square
from which we fold the
E Quanta Module and the edge length of the square from
which we fold the T Quanta
Module is exquisitely minute: it is the difference between
the inside surface and the outside
surface of the material employed to fabricate the model.
In a 20-inch-square model
employing aluminum foil
<BR>
<IMG SRC="figs/f86548.gif" BORDER=0>

1/200th of an inch thick, the E Module would be congruent
with the outside surface and
the T Module would be congruent with the inside surface,
and the ratio of the edge
lengths of the two squares is as 1 is to 0.0005, or
0.0005 of prime vector radius of our
spherical transformation. This minuscule modelable difference
is the difference between <I>it

difference between matter and

 Because we have obtained an intimate glimpse of matter
becoming radiation,
or vice versa, as caused by a minimum-structural-system
tetrahedron's edge-length growth
of only 129 quadrillionths of an inch, and because we
have been paying
faithful attention to the most minute fractions of difference,
we have been introduced to a
whole new frontier of synergetics exploration. We have
discovered the conceptual means
by which the 99 percent of humanity who do not understand
science may become much
more intimate with nature's energetic behaviors, transformations,
capabilities, and
structural and de-structural strategies.

 The 6 + 10 + 15 = 31 great circles of icosahedral symmetries
(Fig.
 <A HREF="p0000.html#901.03">901.03</A>)
produce the spherical-surface right triangle AC''B;
CAB is subdivisible into four spherical
right triangles CDA, CDE, DFE, and EFB. Since there
are 120 CAB triangles, there are
480 subdivision-right-surface triangles. Among these
subdivision-right triangles there are
two back-to-back 90-degree surface angles at D<SUP>&#95;&#95;</SUP>CDA and
CDE<SUP>&#95;&#95;</SUP>and two back-to-back
degree surface angles at F<SUP>&#95;&#95;</SUP>CFE and EFB. The surface
chord DE of the central angle
DOE is identical in magnitude to the surface chord EB
of the central angle EOB, both
being 13.28 degrees of circular azimuth. Surface chord
FB of central angle FOB and
surface chord AD of central angle AOD are identical
in magnitude, both being 10.8
degrees azimuth. In the same manner we find that surface
chord EF of central angle EOF
constitutes the mutual edge of the two surface right
triangles CFE and BFE, the central-
angle magnitude of EOF being 7.77 degrees azimuth. Likewise,
the central angles COA
and COF of the surface chords CA and CF are of the same
magnitude, 20.9 degrees. All
the above data suggest a surprising possibility: that
the small corner triangle AC"B itself
can be folded on its three internal chord lines CD,
CE, and EF, while joining its two edges
AC and CF, which are of equal magnitude, having central
angles of 20.9 degrees. This
folding and joining of F to A and of B to D cancels
out the congruent-letter identities F
and D to produce the tetrahedron ABEC. (See Fig.

 Now we return to Consideration 13 of this discussion
and its discovery of
the surface-to-central-angle interexchanging wave succession
manifest in the cosmic
hierarchy of ever-more-complex, primary structured polyhedra<SUP>&#95;&#95;</SUP>an
interchanging of
inside-out characteristics that inherently produces
positive-negative world conditions;
ergo, it propagates<SUP>&#95;&#95;</SUP>inside-to-outside-to-in<SUP>&#95;&#95;</SUP>pulsed frequencies.
With this kind of self-
propagative regenerative function in view, we now consider
exploring some of the
implications of the fact that the triangle C'AB is foldable
into the E Quanta Module and is
also nestable into the T Quanta Module, which produces
many possibilities:
<OL TYPE="1">
<LI> The triangle AC'B will disconnect and reverse its
faces and complete the enclosure
of the T Quanta Module tetrahedron.
<LI> The 120 T Quanta Modules, by additional tension-induced
twist, take the AC"B
triangles AB ends end-for-end to produce the additional
radius outwardly from O to
convert the T Quanta Modules into "Einstein" E Quanta
Modules, thus radiantly exporting
all 120 modules as photons of light or other radiation.
<LI> The triangle AC"B might disconnect altogether, fold
itself into the miniature T
Quanta Module, and plunge inwardly to fill its angularly
matching central tetrahedral
vacancy.
<LI> The outer triangle may just stay mishinged and flapping,
to leave the tetrahedron's
outer end open.
<LI> The outer triangle might come loose, fold itself
into a miniature T Quanta Module,
and leave the system.
<LI> The 120 miniature T Quanta Modules might fly away
independently<SUP>&#95;&#95;</SUP>as, for
instance, cosmic rays, i.e., as minimum modular fractions
of primitive systems.
<LI> All 120 of these escaping miniature T Quanta Modules
could reassemble themselves
into a miniature 1/120 triacontahedron, each of whose
miniature T Module's outer faces
could fold into mini-mini T Modules and plunge inwardly
in ever-more-concentrating
demonstration of implosion, ad infinitum.
</OL>
<BR>
There are 229,920 other possibilities that any one of
any other number of the 120
individual T Module tetrahedra could behave in any of
the foregoing seven alternate ways
in that vast variety of combinations and frequencies.
At this borderline of ultrahigh
frequency of intertransformability between matter and
electromagnetic radiation we gain
comprehension of how stars and fleas may be designed
and be born.

 Those AC"B triangles appear in the upper left-hand
corner of either the T
Module's or the E Module's square areas COC'C", one
of which has the edge length
0.994 V and the other the edge length of 1.0000 (alpha) V.
Regardless of what those AC"B
triangles may or may not do, their AC"B areas, together
with the areas of the triangles
ACO, ABO, and BCO, exactly constitute the total surface
area of either the T Module or
the E Module.

 The outer triangle AC"B of the T Quanta Module is an
inherent energy
conserver because of its foldability into one (minimum-something)
tetrahedron. When it
folds itself into a miniature T Module with the other
119 T Modules as a surface-closed
rhombic triacontahedron, the latter will be a powerful
energy conserver<SUP>&#95;&#95;</SUP>perhaps
reminiscent of the giant-to-dwarf-Star behavior. The
miniature T Module behavior is also
similar to behaviors of the electron's self-conservation.
This self-conserving and self-
contracting property of the T Quanta Modules, whose
volume energy (ergo, energy
quantum) is identical to that of the A and B Modules,
provides speculative consideration
as to why and how electron mass happens to be only 1/1836
the mass of the proton.

 Certain it is that the T Quanta Module <IMG SRC="../figs/rparrow.gif"> E Quanta Module
threshold
transformation makes it clear how energy goes from matter
to radiation, and it may be that
our little corner triangle AC"B is telling us how radiation
retransforms into matter.

 The volume of the T Quanta Module is identical with
the volumes of the A
and B Quanta Modules, which latter we have been able
to identify with the quarks because
of their clustering in the cosmically minimum, allspace-filling
three-module Mites as A +, A
-, and B, with both A's holding their energy charges
and B discharging its energy in exact
correspondence with the quark grouping and energy-holding-and-releasing
properties,
with the A Modules' energy-holding capabilities being
based on their foldability from only
one triangle, within which triangle the reflection patterning
guarantees the energy
conserving. (See Secs.

 As we study the hierarchy of the surface areas of constant
volume 1 and
their respective shapes, we start with the least-surface
A Quanta Module which is folded
out of one whole triangle, and we find that no other
triangle is enclosed by one triangle
<I>except</I> at the top of the hierarchy, where in the upper
left-hand corner we find our
Minimod T or Minimod E tetrahedron foldable out of our
little triangle AC"B, whose
fold-line patterning is similar to that of the triangle
from which the A Quanta Module is
folded. In between the whole foldable triangular blank
of the A Quanta Module and the
whole foldable triangular blank of the Minimod T or
Minimod E, we have a series of only
asymmetrical folding blanks-until we come to the beautiful
squares of the T and E Quanta
Modules, which occur just before we come to the triangles
of the minimod tetrahedra,
which suggests that we go from radiation to matter with
the foldable triangle and from
matter to radiation when we get to the squares (which
are, of course, two triangles).
