 The A and B Quanta Modules may possibly quantize our
total experience. It
is a phenomenal matter to discover asymmetrical polyhedral
units of geometry that are
reorientably compositable to occupy one asymmetrical
polyhedral space; it is equally
unique that, despite disparate asymmetric polyhedral
form, both have the same volume;
and both associate in different kinds of simplex and
complex, symmetrical and
asymmetrical, coherent systems. While they consist,
in their positive and negative aspects,
of four different asymmetrical shapes, their unit volume
and energy quanta values provide
a geometry elucidating both fundamental structuring
and fundamental and complex
intertransformings, both gravitational and radiational.

the centers of energy in the A and B Quanta Modules
can be locally reoriented within the

configurations of closest-packed
geometry; these local reorientations can either concentrate
and hold or deploy and
distribute the energies of the respective A and B Quanta
Modules, in the first case
concentrating the centers of energy inwardly, and in
the second case deploying the centers
of energy outwardly.

 In X-ray diffraction, you can see just such alternate
energy concentrations of
omnideployed patterns in successive heat treatments
of metals. You can hit a piece of
metal and you will find by X-ray diffraction that a
previously concentrated array of centers
of energy have been elegantly deployed. When you take
the temper out of the metal, the
energy centers will again change their positions. The
metal's coherence strength is
lessened as the energy centers are outwardly deployed
into diffused remoteness from one
another. When the centers of energy are arranged closer
to one another, they either attract
or repulse one another at the exponentially increasing
rates of gravitational and radiational
law. When we heat-treat or anneal metals and alloys,
they transform in correspondence
with the reorientabilities of the A and B Quanta Modules.

 The identical volumes and the uniquely different energy-transforming
capabilities of the A and B Quanta Modules and their
mathematically describable behaviors
(10F<SUP>2</SUP> + 2) hint at correspondence with the behaviors
of neutrons and protons. They are
not mirror images of one another, yet, like the proton
and neutron, they are energetically
intertransformable and, due to difference of interpatternability,
they have difference in
mass relationship. Whether they tend to conserve or
dissipate energy might impose a
behavioral difference in the processes of measuring
their respective masses. A behavioral
proclivity must impose effects upon the measuring process.

 <B>Energy Behavior in Tetrahedra:</B> A tetrahedron that
can be folded out of a
single foldable triangle has the strange property of
holding energy in varying degrees.
Energy will bounce around inside the tetrahedron's four
internal triangles as we described
its bouncing within one triangle (see Sec.
 <A HREF="p0000.html#901.00">901</A>). Many
bounce patterns are cyclically
accomplished without tendency to bounce out of tetrahedrons,
whether regular or
irregular, symmetrical or asymmetrical.

 The equiangled, omni-sixty-degreed, regular tetrahedron
can be opened
along any three edges converging at any one of its vertexes
with its edge-separated
vertexial group of three triangles appearing as a three-petaled
flower bud about to open.
By deliberately opening the three triangular petals,
by rotating them outward from one
another around their three unsevered base-edge hinges,
all three may be laid out flat
around the central base triangle to appear as a two-frequency,
edge-moduled, equiangular
triangle consisting of four internal triangles. Energy
tends by geodesical economy and
angular law to be bounce-confined by the tetrahedron.

 All the interior edges of the triangles, like the
edges of a triangular billiard
table, will provide unique internal, bouncing, comer-pocket-seeking
patterns. An
equilateral, equiangled triangle will hold the bouncing
with the least tendency to exit at the
pocketed comers. The more asymmetrical the triangular
billiard table, the more swiftly the
angular progression to exit it at a comer pocket. The
various bounce patterns prior to exit
induce time-differentiated lags in the rate of energy
release from one tetrahedron into the
other tetrahedron.

 Energy bounces around in triangles working toward
the narrowest vertex,
where the impossibility of more than one line going
through any one point at any one time
imposes a twist vertex exit at the comers of all polyhedra.
Therefore, all triangles and
tetrahedra "leak" energy, but when doing so between
two similar corresponding vertexes-
interconnected tetrahedra, the leaks from one become
the filling of the other.

Modules can
hold energy and tend to conserve it. They do so by combining
with one another in three
unique ways, each of which combine as one regular tetrahedron;
the regular tetrahedron
being a fundamental energy-holding form-the energy being

 <B>Summary:</B> Though of equal energy potential or latent
content, the As and
the Bs are two different systems of unique energy-behavior
containment. One is
circumferentially embracing, energy-impounding, integratively
finite, and nucleation-
conserving. The other is definitively disintegrative
and nuclearly exportive. A is outside-
inwardly introvertive. B is outside-outwardly extrovertive.

 <B>Precession of Two Module Edges:</B> There are six edges
of a tetrahedron,
and each edge precesses the opposite edge toward a 90-degrees-maximum
of attitudinal
difference of orientation. Any two discrete, opposite
edges can be represented by two
aluminum tubes, X and Y (see Illus.
 <A HREF="p2000.html#923.10">923.10D</A>), which
can move longitudinally anywhere
along their respective axes while the volume of the
irregular tetrahedra remains constant.
They may shuttle along on these lines and produce all
kinds of asymmetrical tetrahedra,
whose volumes will always remain unit by virtue of their
developed tetrahedra's constant
base areas and identical altitudes. The two tubes' four
ends produce the other four
interconnecting edges of the tetrahedron, which vary
as required without altering the
constantly uniform volume.

 A line can be projected from its origin at the center
of area of the triangular
base of a regular tetrahedron, outward through the opposite
apex of the tetrahedron to
any desired distance. When subdivided into increments
equal to the distance between its
triangular-base center and its apex, and when each of
these equilinear increments outward
beyond the apex is interconnected by three lines leading
to each of the three comers of the
base triangle, then each of the successive volumetric
additions will be of identical volume
to that of the original tetrahedra, and the overall
form will be that of a tetrahedron which
become progressively longer and sharp-pointed with each
addition. (See Illus.
 <A HREF="p2000.html#923.10">923.10</A> A,
B, and C.) As the ever-sharpening and elongating tetrahedron
approaches infinity, the
three elongating edges tend to parallelism; i.e., toward
what is known as parallax in
astronomy. The modules will tend to congruence with
the parallaxing lines. Each full-line-
long length model of these congruent lines will have
the same volume as the original
module.

with unit base
and add unit altitude, C, D, E, F, and so forth, but
as each additional altitude is
superimposed, the volume remains the same: a volume
of one. We find these linear
incrementation assemblies getting longer, with their
additional volumes always one.
Suppose we think about this progression as forming an
electric-wire conductor and divide
its circular base into three 120-degree angles. Its
progressive conic increments could grow
and operate in the same manner as our constant-volume,
tetrahedral modules.

 We will inherently superimpose progressive base-to-apex
attenuating
sections. In the electric conductor wire, this means
that whatever energy increment is fed
into the first base module will tend to be conducted
at various unit frequencies along the
line. Each unique frequency introduced at the base will
create its unique conic altitude
incrementation. The outermost, line-long cone's energy
quantum will always be the same
as that of the initial base cone. Finally, the last
and outermost cone is just as long as the
wire itself-so there is an outside charge on the wire
tending to fluoresce a precessional
broadcasting of the initial inputs at 90 degrees; i.e.,
perpendicularly away from the wire.
This may elucidate antenna behaviors as well as long-distance,
high-voltage, electric
energy conductions which tend to broadcast their conducted
energy. (For further
elaboration of the constant-volume, tetrahedral models,

 But the A (+) and A (-), and B (+) and B (-) respective
volumetric centers
are never congruent. However, the positive or the negative
AAB aggregates (these are the
