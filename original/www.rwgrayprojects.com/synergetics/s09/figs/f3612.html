<TR><TD>Fig. 936.12 Octahedron as Conservation and Annihilation
Model: If we think of the octahedron as
defined by the interconnections of six closest-packed
spheres, gravitational pull can make one of the four
equatorial vectors disengage from its two adjacent equatorial
vertexes to rotate 90 degrees and rejoin the
north and south vertexes in the transformation completed
as at I. (See color plate 6.)
