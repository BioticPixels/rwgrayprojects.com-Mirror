<TR><TD>Fig. 987.312 Rhombic Dodecahedron:
<OL TYPE="A">
<LI> The 25 great circle system of the vector equilibrium
with the four great circles shown in dotted lines.
(Compare Fig.
 <A HREF="../../s04/p5300.html#454.06">454.06D</A>, third printing.)
<LI> Spherical rhombic dodecahedron great circle system
generated from six-great-circle system of vector
equilibrium, in which the two systems are partially
congruent. The 12 rhombuses of the spherical
rhombic dodecahedron are shown in heavy outline. In
the interrelationship between the spherical and
planar rhombic dodecahedron it is seen that the planar
rhombus comes into contact with the sphere
at the mid-face point.
