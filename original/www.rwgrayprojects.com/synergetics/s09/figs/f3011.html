<TR><TD>Fig. 930.11: This continuous triangulation pattern strip
is a 60 , angular, "come and go" alternation of
very-high-frequency energy events of unit wavelength.
This strip folded back on itself becomes a series of
octahedra. The octahedra strips then combine to form
a space-filling array of octahedra and tetrahedra,
with all lines or vectors being of identical length
and all the triangles equilateral and all the vertexes
being omnidirectionally evenly spaced from one another.
This is the pattern of "closest packing" of
spheres.
