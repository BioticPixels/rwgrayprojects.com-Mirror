<TR><TD>Fig. 987.326 Stellated Rhombic Dodecahedron:
<OL TYPE="A">
<LI> Rhombic dodecahedron with diamond faces subdivided
into quadrants to describe mid-face centers.
Interior lines with arrows show unit radii from system
center to mid-face centers. This is the initial
rhombic dodeca of tetravolume-6.
<LI> The rhombic dodecahedron system is "pumped out" with
radii doubled from unit radius to radius =
2, or twice prime vector radius . This produces the
stellated rhombic dodecahedron of tetravolume-
12.
<LI> The stellated rhombic dodecahedron vertexes are congruent
with the mid-edge points of the cube of
tetravolume-24. A composite of three two-frequency Couplers
(each individually of tetravolume-8)
altogether comprises a star complex of tetravolume-12,
sharing a common central rhombic dodeca
domain of tetravolume-6. The stellated rhombic dodeca
of tetravolume-12 is half the volume of the
24-tetravolume cube that inscribes it. (Compare the
Duo-Tet Cube at Fig.
