<TR><TD>Fig. 938.13 Six Vectors of Additional Quantum Vanish
and Reappear in Jitterbug Transformation
Between Vector Equilibrium and Icosahedron: The icosahedral
stage in accommodated by the
annihilation of the nuclear sphere, which in effect
reappears in transformation as six additional external
vectors that structurally stabilize the six "square"
faces of the vector equilibrium and constitute an
additional quantum package. (See also color plate 7.)
