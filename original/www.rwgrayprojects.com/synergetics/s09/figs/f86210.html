<TR><TD>Fig. 986.210 Diagonal of Cube as Unity in Synergetic
Geometry: In synergetic geometry mensural unity
commences with the tetra edge as prime vector. Unity
is taken not from the cube edge but from the edge
of one of the two tetra that structure it. (Compare
Fig. 463.01.) Proportionality exactly known to us is
not
required in nature's structuring. Parts have no existence
independent of the polyhedra they constitute.
