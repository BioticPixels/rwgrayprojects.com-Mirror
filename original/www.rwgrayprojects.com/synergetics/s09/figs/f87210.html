<TR><TD>Fig. 987.210 Subdivision of Tetrahedral Unity: Symmetry
#1:
<OL TYPE="A">
<LI>Initial tetrahedron at two-frequency stage.
<LI> Tetrahedron is truncated: four regular corner tetra
surround a central octa. The truncations are not
produced by great-circle cleavages. C, D, and E show
great-circle cleavages of the central
octahedron. (For clarity, the four corner tetra are
not shown.) Three successive great-circle cleavages
of the tetrahedron are spun by the three axes connecting
the midpoints of opposite pairs of the tetra's
six edges.
<LI> First great-circle cleavage produces two Half-Octa.
<LI>Second great-circle cleavage produces a further subdivision
into four irregular tetra called
"Icebergs."
<LI> Third great-circle cleavage produces the eight Eighth-Octahedra
of the original octa.
<LI> Eight Eighth-Octa and four corner tetras reassembled
as initial tetrahedron.
