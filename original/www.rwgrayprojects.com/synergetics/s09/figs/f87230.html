<TR><TD>Fig 987.230 Subdivision of Tetrahedral Unity: Symmetry
#3:
<OL TYPE="A">
<LI> The large triangle is the tetrahedron face. The smaller
inscribed triangle is formed by connecting the
mid-points of the tetra edges and represents the octa
face congruent with the plane of the tetra face.
<LI> Connecting the midpoints of the opposite pairs of
the internal octahedron's 12 edges provides the six
axes of spin for the six great circle system of Symmetry
#3. The perpendicular bisectors at A and B
are projections resulting from the great circle spinning.
B also shows an oblique view of the half-
Tetra or "Chef's Caps" separated by the implied square.
(For other views of Chef's Caps compare
Figs.
 <A HREF="../../s01/p0000.html#100.103">100.103</A> B and
 <A HREF="../../s05/p2700.html#527.08">527.08</A> A&B.)
<LI> The six great circle fractionations subdivide the
tetrahedron into 24 A Quanta Modules.
<LI> Exploded view of the tetrahedron's 24 A Quanta Modules.
<LI> Further explosion of tetrahedron's A Quanta Modules.
