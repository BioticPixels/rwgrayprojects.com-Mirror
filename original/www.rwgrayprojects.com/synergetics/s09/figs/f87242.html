<TR><TD>Fig. 987.242 Evolution of Duo-Tet Cube and Hourglass
Polyhedron:
<OL TYPE="A">
<LI> One positive regular tetrahedron and one negative
regular tetrahedron are intersymmetrically arrayed
within the common nuclear-vertexed location. Their internal
trussing permits their equi-inter-
distanced vertexes to define a stable eight-cornered
structure, a "cube." The cube is tetravolume-3; as
shown here we observe 1 l/2-tetravolumes of "substance"
within the eight vertexes and 1 1/2-
tetravolumes of complementation domain within the eight
vertexes . The overall cubic domain
consists of three tetravolumes: one outside-out (1 1/2)
and one inside-out (1 1/2). The same star
polyhedron appears within a vector equilibrium net at
Fig. 1006.32.
<LI> Octahedron: tetravolume-4
<LI> Icosahedron; tetravolume- 18.51229586
<LI> Vector equilibrium: tetravolume-20
<LI> Eight-faceted asymmetric Hourglass Polyhedron: tetravolume-l
l/2. These complex asymmetric
doughnut-cored hexahedra appear within the star polyhedron
at A.
