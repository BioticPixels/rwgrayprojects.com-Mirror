<TR><TD>Fig. 916.01 Division of Eighth-Octahedron into Six Parts:
B Quanta Module: The regular octahedron
(A) is divided into eight identical units (B) equaling
1/8 of the volume of the octahedron. The quarter
tetrahedron as defined by six A Modules (C) is subtracted
from the 1/8-octahedron (D). This fractional
unit is then subdivided into six identical irregular
tetrahedra that appear as three right-hand and three
left-hand units and are referred to as B Modules. They
are equal in volume to the A Modules and are
consequently also 1/24th of the regular tetrahedron.
In (F) is shown the plane net which will fold into
either the right or left B Module. Vertex A is at the
vertex of the octahedron. Vertex C is at the mid-edge
of the octahedron. Vertex E is at the center of gravity
of the octahedron.
