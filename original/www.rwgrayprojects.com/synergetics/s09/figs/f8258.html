<TR><TD>Fig. 982.58  Nuclear Sphere of Volume 5 Enclosing
the Vector Equilibrium of Volume 2 1/2 with the Vector Equilibrium's
Vertexes Congruent with the Nuclear Sphere:  Shown are 15 of the Basic
Disequilibrium 120 LCD triangles per sphere which transform as A Quanta
Module tetrahedra.  In the 25-great-circle subdividing of the
vector equilibrium's sphere, the three great-circles produce the
spherical octahedron, one of whose eight spherical triangles is shown
here.  As was shown on the icosahedron, the 120 triangles of the 15
great circles divide the sphere in such a way that the spherical
octahedron's triangle can be identified exactly with 15 Basic
Disequilibrium 120 LCD Triangles.  Here we show the 15 disequilibrium triangles
on the spherical octahdron of the vector equilibrium: 8&215;15=120 spherical
right triangles which tangentially accommodate-closely but not exactly-the
120 A Quanta Modules folded into tetrahedra and inserted, acute corners inward to the
sphere's center, which could not be exactly accommodated in the shallower
icosahedral phase because of nuclear collapse and radius shortening
in the icosahedron.
