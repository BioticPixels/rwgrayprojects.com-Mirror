<TR><TD>Fig. 988.12 Icosahedron Inscribed Within Octahedron:
The four-frequency tetrahedron inscribes an
internal octahedron within which may be inscribed a
skew icosahedron. Of the icosahedron's 20
equiangular triangle faces, four are congruent with
the plane of the tetra's faces (and with four external
faces of the inscribed octahedron). Four of the icosahedron's
other faces are congruent with the
remaining four internal faces of the icosahedron. Two-fifths
of the icosa faces are congruent with the octa
faces. It requires 24 S Quanta Modules to fill in the
void between the octa and the icosa.
