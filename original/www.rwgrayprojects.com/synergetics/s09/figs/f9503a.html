<TR><TD>Fig. 995.03A Vector Models of Atomic Nuclei: Magic Numbers:
In the structure of atomic nuclei there
are certain numbers of neutrons and protons which correspond
to states of increased stability. These
numbers are known as the magic numbers and have the
following values: 2, 8, 20, 28, 50, 82, and 126. A
vector model is proposed to account for these numbers
based on combinations of the three fundamental
omnitriangulated structures: the tetrahedron, octahedron,
and icosahedron. In this system all vectors have
a have of one-third. The magic numbers are accounted
for by summing the total number of vectors in
each set and multiplying the total by 1/3. Note that
although the tetrahedra are shown as opaque,
nevertheless all the internal vectors defined by the
isotropic vector matrix are counted in addition to
the
vectors visible on all faces of the tetrahedra.
