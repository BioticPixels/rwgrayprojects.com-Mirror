<TR><TD>Fig. 936.19 Tetrahedral Quantum is Lost and Reappears
in Transformation between Octahedron and
Three-tetra-arc Tetrahelix: This transformation has
the precessional effect of rearranging the energy
vectors from 4-tetravolumes to 3-tetravolumes and reverse.
The neutral symmetric octahedron rearranges
itself into an asymmetric embryonic wave pattern. The
four-membered individual-link continuity is a
potential electromagnetic-circuitry gap closer. The
furthermost ends of the tetra-arc group are
alternatively vacant. (See also color plate 6.)
