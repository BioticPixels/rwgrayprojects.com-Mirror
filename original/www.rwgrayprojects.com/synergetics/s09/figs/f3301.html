<TR><TD>Fig. 933.01: These helical columns of tetrahedra, which
we call the tetrahelix, explain the structuring of
DNA models of the control of the fundamental patterning
of nature's biological structuring as contained
within the virus nucleus. It takes just 10 triple-bonded
tetrahedra to make a helix cycle, which is a
molecular compounding characteristic also of the Watson-Crick
model of the DNA. When we address
two or more positive (or two or more negative) tetrahelixes
together, they nestle their angling forms into
one another. When so nestled the tetrahedra are grouped
in local clusters of five tetrahedra around a
transverse axis in the tetrahelix nestling columns.
Because the dihedral angles of five tetrahedra are
7&deg; 20' short of 360&deg;, this 7&deg; 20' is sprung-closed by the
helix structure's spring contraction. This backed-up
spring tries constantly to unzip one nestling tetrahedron
from the other, or others, of which it is a true
replica. These are direct (theoretical) explanations
of otherwise as yet unexplained behavior of the DNA.
