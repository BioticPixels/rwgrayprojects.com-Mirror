transform by symmetrical

accommodated by the nuclear sphere's annihilation, which
vanished central sphere
reappears transformedly in the 30-vector-edged icosahedron
as the six additional external
vectors added to the vector equilibrium to structurally
stabilize its six "square" faces,
which six vectors constitute one quantum package. (See

 Next the icosahedron contracts symmetrically to the
congruently vectored
octahedron stage, where symmetrical contraction ceases
and precessional torque reduces
the system to the quadrivalent tetrahedron's congruent
four positive and four negative
tetrahedra. These congruent eight tetrahedra further
precess into eight congruent zero-
altitude tetrahedral triangles in planar congruence
as one, having accomplished this
contraction from volume 20 of the vector equilibrium
to volume 0 while progressively
reversing the vector edges by congruence, reducing the
original 30 vector edges (five
quanta) to zero quanta volume with only three vector
edges, each consisting of eight
congruent vectors in visible evidence in the zero-altitude
tetrahedron. And all this is
accomplished without ever severing the exterior, gravitational-embracing
bond integrity of
the system. (See Figs.

 The octahedron is produced by one positive and one
negative tetrahedron.
This is done by opening one vertex of each of the tetrahedra,
as the petals of a flower are
opened around its bud's vertex, and taking the two open-flowered
tetrahedra, each with
three triangular petals surrounding a triangular base,
precessing in a positive-negative way
so that the open triangular petals of each tetrahedron
approach the open spaces between
the petals of the other tetrahedron, converging them
to produce the eight edge-bonded

 Because the octahedron can be produced by one positive
and one negative
tetrahedron, it can also be produced by one positive
tetrahedron alone. It can be produced
by the four edge-bonded triangular faces of one positive
tetrahedron, each being unbonded
and precessed 60 degrees to become only vertex-interbonded,
one with the other. This
produces an octahedron of four positive triangular facets
interspersed symmetrically with
four empty triangular windows. (See Fig.

 <I>Octahedron:</I> The octahedron or "Octa" is composed of
96 energy quanta
modules of which 48 are red B Quanta Modules and 48
blue A Quanta Modules. It has
two module layers, with the inner, or nuclear, aggregate
being the 48 red Bs and the outer
layer comprised of the 48 blue As. The octahedron is
all blue outside with a red nucleus.

 The octahedron has distributive energies occurring
at its nucleus, but they
are locked up by the outer layer of A Modules. Thus
the tendency of the 48 red B Module
energy distributors is effectively contained and conserved
by the 48 blue A Module
conservators.

 <B>Cube:</B> The cube is composed of a total of 72 energy
quanta modules, of
which there are 48 blue A Modules and 24 red B Modules.
The cube is produced by
superimposing four Eighth-Octahedra upon the four equiangle
triangular faces of the
regular tetrahedron.

 The cube is three module layers deep, and the layering
occurs around each of
its eight corners. All of the cube's nuclear and outer-shell-modules
three-layer edges are
seen to surface congruently along the six diagonal seams
of the cube's six faces. The inner
nucleus of the cube consists of the blue introverted
tetrahedron with its 24 A Modules.
This introverted tetrahedron is next enshelled by the
24 blue A Modules extroverted on the
introvert nuclear tetrahedron's four faces to form the
isosceles dodecahedron. The third
and outer layer of the cube consists of the 24 red B
Modules mounted outward of the
isosceles dodecahedron's 24 extroverted A Modules.

 Thus, as it is seen from outside, the cube is an all-red
tetrahedron, but its
energy-distributive surface layer of 24 red B Modules
is tensively overpowered two-to-
one and cohered as a cube by its 48 nuclear modules.
The distributors are on the outside.
This may elucidate the usual occurrence of cubes in
crystals with one or more of their
corners truncated.

 The minimum cube that can be formed by closest packing
of spheres (which
are inherently stable, structurally speaking) is produced
by nesting four balls in the
triangular mid-face nests of the four faces of a three-layer,
ten-ball tetrahedron, with no
ball at its volumetric center. This produces an eight-ball-cornered
symmetry, which
consists of 14 balls in all, with no ball at its center.
This complex cube has a total of 576 A
and B Modules, in contradistinction to the simplest
tetra-octa-produced cube constituted
of 72 A and B Modules.

 <B>Rhombic Dodecahedron:</B> The rhombic dodecahedron is
composed of 144
energy quanta modules. Like the cube, the rhombic dodecahedron
is a three-module
layered nuclear assembly, with the two-layered octahedron
and its exclusively red B
Moduled nucleus (of 48 Bs) enveloped with 48 exclusively
blue A Modules, which in turn
are now enclosed in a third shell of 48 blue A Modules.
Thus we find the rhombic
dodecahedron and the cube co-occurring as the first
three-layered, nuclearly centered
symmetries-with the cube having its one layer of 24
red B Modules on the outside of its
two blue layers of 24 A Modules each; conversely, the
rhombic dodecahedron has its two
blue layers of 48 A Modules each on the outside enclosing
its one nuclear layer of 48 red
B Modules.

 The most simply logical arrangement of the blue A
and red B Modules is one
wherein their 1/144th-sphere-containing, most acute
corners are all pointed inward and
join to form one whole sphere completely contained within
the rhombic dodecahedron,
with the contained-sphere's surface symmetrically tangent
to the 12 mid-diamond facets of
the rhombic dodecahedron, those 12 tangent points exactly
coinciding with the points of
tangency of the 12 spheres closest-packed around the
one sphere. (For a discussion of the

 <B>Vector Equilibrium:</B> The vector equilibrium is composed

Modules and 144 red B Modules for a total of 480 energy
quanta modules: 480 = 2<SUP>5</SUP> &#215; 5 &#215;
3. The eight tetrahedra of the vector equilibrium consist
entirely of blue A Modules, with a
total of 48 such blue A Modules Lying in the exterior
shell. The six square faces of the
vector equilibrium are the six half-octahedra, each
composed of 24 blue As and 24 red Bs,
from which inventory the six squares expose 48 red B
Modules on the exterior shell. An
even number of 48 As and 48 Bs provide an equilibrious
exterior shell for the vector
equilibrium: what an elegance! The distributors and
the conservators balance. The six
square areas' energies of the vector equilibrium equal
the triangles' areas' energies. The
distributors evacuate the half-octahedra faces and the
basic triangular structure survives.

 The vector equilibrium's inherently symmetrical, closest-packed-sphere
aggregate has one complete sphere occurring at its volumetric
center for the first time in
the hierarchy of completely symmetrical, closest-packed
sets. In our multilayered,
omniunique patterning of symmetrical nuclear assemblies,
the vector equilibrium's inner

tetrahedral domains and its six half-
octahedra domains, each of which domains constitutes

 Atoms borrow electrons when they combine. The open
and unstable square
faces of the vector equilibrium provide a model for
the lending and borrowing operations.
When the frequency is three, we can lend four balls
from each square. Four is the greatest
number of electrons that can be lent: here is a limit
condition with the three-frequency and
the four-ball edge. All the borrowing and lending operates
in the squares. The triangles do
not get jeopardized by virtue of lending. A lending
and borrowing vector equilibrium is
maintained without losing the structural integrity of
Universe.

 The first possible closest-packed formulation of a
tetrakaidecahedron occurs
with a three-frequency vector equilibrium as its core,
with an additional six truncated,
square-bottomed, and three-frequency-based and two-frequency-plateaued
units
superimposed on the six square faces of the three-frequency,
vector-equilibrium nuclear
core. The three-frequency vector equilibrium consists
of a shell of 92 unit radius spheres
closest packed symmetrically around 42 spheres of the
same unit radius, which in turn
closest-pack enclose 12 spheres of the same unit radius,
which are closest packed around
one nuclear sphere of the same unit radius, with each
closest-packed-sphere shell
enclosure producing a 14-faceted, symmetrical polyhedron
of eight triangular and six
square equiedged facets. The tetrakaidecahedron's six
additional square nodes are
produced by adding nine spheres to each of the six square
faces of the three-frequency
vector equilibrium's outermost 92-sphere layer. Each
of these additional new spheres is
placed on each of the six square facets of the vector
equilibrium by nesting nine balls in
closest packing in the nine possible ball matrix nests
of the three-frequency vector
equilibrium's square facets; which adds 54 balls to
