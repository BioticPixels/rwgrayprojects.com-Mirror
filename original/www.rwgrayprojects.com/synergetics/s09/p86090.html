 Several things were certain: nature is capable of both
omnidirectional
disorderly, dispersive, and destructive expansion and
omnidirectional collective, selective
sorting and constructive contraction; and rays of candlelight
are not parallel to one
another. I decided to initiate my search for nature's
coordinate system by assuming that
the coordinate system must be convergently and divergently
interaccommodative. That the
seasons of my New England childhood brought forth spectacular
transformations in
nature's total interpatterning; that the transformations
were not simultaneous nor
everywhere the same; that there were shaded and Sun-shined-upon
area variables; and that
they were all embraced by a comprehensive coordination<SUP>&#95;&#95;</SUP>altogether
made me dream of
comprehending the comprehensively accommodating coordinate
system that had no
separate departments of chemistry, physics, biology,
mathematics, art, history, or
languages. I said nature has only one department and
only one language.

 These thoughts kept stimulating my explorations for
the totally
accommodative coordinate system. Einstein's conclusion-that
the definitive, maximum
possible speed of light rendered astronomical phenomena
an aggregate of nonsimultaneous
and only partially overlapping, differently enduring
energy events<SUP>&#95;&#95;</SUP>greatly affected the
increasing inventory of my tentative formulations of
the interaccommodative requirements
of the cosmic coordination system which I sought. I
was driven by both consciously and
subconsciously sustained intuition and excitement. This
was very private, however. I
talked to no one about it. It was all very remote from
that which seemed to characterize
popular interest.

 The youthful accruals of these long-sustained private
observations,
cogitations, and speculations were enormously helpful
when I decided at the age of 32, in
my crisis year of 1927, to abandon the game of competitive
survival (a game I had been
taught to believe in as thought-out, managed, and evolved
entirely by others) and instead
to rely completely upon my own thinking and experience-suggested
inclinations . . . to find
out how Universe is organized and what it is doing unbeknownst
to humans. Why are
humans here in Universe? What should we be doing to
fulfill our designed functioning in
Universe? Surely all those stars and galaxies were not
designed only to be romantic
scenery for human moods. What am I designed to be able
to comprehend about Universe?
What are we humans designed to be able to do for one
another and for our Universe?

 <B>Expanding Universe:</B> My determination to commit myself
completely to the
search for nature's raison d'ˆtre and for its comprehensive
coordinate system's
mathematics was greatly reinforced by the major discovery
of the astronomer E. P. Hubble
in 1924. He discovered an expanding macrocosmic system
with all the myriads of galaxies
and their respective stellar components at all times
maintaining the same interangular
orientations and relative interdistancings from one
another while sum-totally and
omnisymmetrically expanding and moving individually
away from one another, and doing
so at astronomical speeds. This discovery of Hubble's
became known as Expanding
Universe.

 The only way humans can expand their houses is by constructing
lopsided
additions to their rectilinearly calculated contriving.
People found that they could "blow
up" rubber-balloon spheres to increase their radii,
but they couldn't blow up their
buildings except by dynamite. They called their wooden
"2 &#215; 4," and "2 &#215 6," and "2 &#215 8-
inch" cross-section, wooden-timber nail-ups "balloon
framing," but why they selected that
name was difficult to explain.

 My insights regarding nature's coordinate system were
greatly enhanced by
two of Milton Academy's greatest teachers: Homer LeSourd
in physics and William Lusk
Webster Field ("Biology Bill") in biology. During the
summer vacation of 1906, at 11
years of age I designed and built my first small but
exciting experimental dwelling on our
family's small mid-Penobscot Bay island. Living all
my youthful summers on that island,
with its essential boat-building, boat-modifying, boat-upkeep,
and boat-sailing, followed
by five years as a line officer in the regular U.S.
Navy with some of my own smaller-craft
commands, some deck-officering on large craft of the
new era's advanced technology
ships, together with service involving airplanes, submarines,
celestial navigation, ballistics,
radio, and radiotelephone; then resignation from the
Navy followed by five more private-
enterprise years developing a new building system, inventing
and installing its production
tools, managing the production of the materials, and
erecting therewith 240 residences and
small commercial buildings<SUP>&#95;&#95;</SUP>altogether finally transformed
my sustained activity into full
preoccupation with my early-boyhood determination some
day to comprehend and codify
nature's omniintertransformative, omnidirectional, cosmic
coordination system and its
holistic, only-experientially-proven mathematics. In
1928, inspired and fortified by
Hubble's Expanding Universe discovery, I gave the name
and its symbol 4-D to my
mathematical preoccupations and their progressively
discovered system codifying. In 1936
I renamed my discipline "Energetic Vectorial Geometry."
In 1938 I again renamed it
"Energetic-synergetic Geometry," and in 1970 for verbal
economy contracted that title to
"Synergetics." (See Fig.

 At the outset of my lifelong search for nature's omnirational

system of mathematical interaccounting and intertransformability
I proceeded through a

 I first determined to employ only vectors for lines.
I realized that
operationally all lines are always trajectories of energy
events, either as the energy
invested by humans in the work of carving or depositing
linearly<SUP>&#95;&#95;</SUP>which we call
"drawing" a line<SUP>&#95;&#95;</SUP>or as the inanimately articulated energy
of force lines.

 Vectors always represent energy forces of given magnitude
operating at
given angles upon given entities at given loci, and
vectors may always be demonstrated by
lines representing given mass moving at given velocity
in unique angular direction in
respect to a given axis of observation. Vectors do not
occur singly: They occur only as the
total family of forces interacting in any given physical
circumstance.

 Vectors always have unique length, that length being
the product of the mass
and the velocity as expressed in a given modular system
of measurement. Vectors do not
have inherent extendibility to infinity<SUP>&#95;&#95;</SUP>as did the lines
of my boyhood's schoolteachers.
Vectors are inherently terminal. Vectors bring into
geometry all the qualities of energetic
reality lacking in Euclidean geometry: time and energy-energy
differentially divergent as
radiation (velocity) and energy integratively convergent
as matter (mass). Velocity and
mass could be resolved into numerically described time
and temperature components.

 Avogadro discovered that under identical conditions
of pressure and heat all
elements in their gaseous state always consist of the
same number of molecules per given
volume. Since the chemical elements are fundamentally
different in electron-proton
componentation, this concept seemed to me to be <I>the</I>
"Grand Central Station" of nature's
numerical coordinate system's geometric volume-that
numerically exact volumes contain
constant, exact numbers of fundamental energy entities.
This was the numerical and
geometrical constancy for which I was looking. I determined
to generalize Avogadro's
experimentally proven hypothesis that "under identical
conditions of heat and pressure all
gases disclose the same number of molecules per given
volume." (See Secs.

 Here were Physical Universe's natural number quantations
being constantly
related to given volumes. Volumes are geometrical entities.
Geometrically defined and
calculated volumes are polyhedral systems. Polyhedra
are defined by edge lines, each of
which must be a vector.

 Within any given volumetrically contained gaseous state
the energy kinetics
of molecules are everywhere the same. The outward pressure
of air against the enclosing
tube wall and casing of any one automobile tire is everywhere
the same. Pressure and heat
differentials involve isolated conditions<SUP>&#95;&#95;</SUP>isolated by
containers; ergo, special cases. To me
this meant that we could further generalize Avogadro
by saying that "`under identical,
uncontained, freely self-interarranging conditions of
energy all chemical elements will
disclose the same number of fundamental somethings per
given volume." This constant-
volume-population-and-omniequilibrious-energy relationship
would require physically
demonstrable, substantive, geometrical combining of
a given number of unique energetic-
event entities per unit volume with constant-angularly-defined
positional orientation
integrities. This meant that the vectorially structured
shapes of the volumes
accommodating given numbers of most primitive energy
events must be experientially
demonstrable.

 I said that since vectors are physically modelable
structural components, they
produce conceptual structural models of energy events,
and since my hypothetical
generalization of Avogadro's law requires that "all
the conditions of energy be everywhere
the same," what does this condition look like as structured
in vectorial geometry?
Obviously all the vectors must be the same length and
all of them must interact at the same
angles. I said: It will make no difference what length
is employed so long as they are all
the same length. Linear size is special case. Special
case occurs only in time. Angles are
cosmically constant independently of time-size considerations.

 I said, Can you make a vector model of this generalization
of Avogadro?
And I found that I had already done so in that kindergarten
event in 1899 when I was
almost inoperative visually and was exploring tactilely
for a structural form that would
hold its shape. This I could clearly feel was the triangle<SUP>&#95;&#95;</SUP>with
which I could make systems
having insides and outsides. This was when I first made
the octet truss out of toothpicks
and semidried peas, which interstructuring pattern scientists
decades later called the
"isotropic vector matrix," meaning that the vectorial
lengths and interanglings are
everywhere the same. (See Sec.

 This matrix was vectorially modelable since its lines,
being vectors, did not
lead to infinity. This isotropic vector matrix consists
of six-edged tetrahedra plus 12-edged

 The installation of the closest-packed unit-radius
spheres into their
geometrical congruence with the isotropic vector matrix
showed that each of the vectors
always reaches between the spheric centers of any two
tangentially adjacent spheres. This
meant that the radius of each of the <I>kissing</I> spheres
consists of one-half of the
interconnecting vectors. Wherefore, the radius of our
closest-packed spheres being half of
the system vector, it became obvious that if we wished
to consider the radius of the unit
sphere as unity, we must assume that the value of the
vector inherently interconnecting
two unit spheres is two. Unity is plural and at minimum
two. Diameter means dia-
<I>meter</I><SUP>&#95;&#95;</SUP>unit of system measurement is two.

2 R = Diameter
<BR>
Diameter is the relative-conceptual-size determinant
of a system. A diameter is the
prime characteristic of the symmetrical system. The
separate single system = unity.
Diameter describes unity. Unity = 2. (See Secs.

 Understanding means comprehending the interrelationship
of the observer
and the observed. Definitive understanding of interrelationships
is expressed by ratios.

 At the outset of my explorations I made the working
assumption that unity is
two, as combined with the experimentally demonstrable
fact that every system and every
systemic special case sphere is at once both a concave
and a convex sphere<SUP>&#95;&#95;</SUP>ergo, always
inherently two spheres. Reflective concave surfaces
convergently concentrate all
impinging radiation, and reflective convex surfaces
divergently diffuse all impinging
radiation. Though concave and convex are inherently
congruent as they are always-and-
only <I>co</I>existing, they are also diametrically opposed
physical behavior phenomena<SUP>&#95;&#95;</SUP>ergo,
absolutely different because the one diffuses the energies
of Universe, producing
macrocosmic dispersion, and the other concentrates the
energies of Universe, producing
microcosmic convergence. Concave and convex are explicitly
two opposites cosituate
(congruent) geometrically as one. This led me to the
working assumption at the outset of
my<SUP>&#95;&#95;</SUP>thus far<SUP>&#95;&#95;</SUP>60-year exploration for nature's own coordinate
system, that unity is
inherently plural and at minimum is to be dealt with
as the value two, which twoness might
well coexist with other numbers of inherent properties
of primary-existence systems.

 I then identified this closest-packed-spheres isotropic
vector matrix as a
generalized field condition of the everywhere-and-everywhen
most economically
interaccommodating of any plurality of nuclearly convergent-divergent,
importively
organizing, and exportingly info-dispensing energy events<SUP>&#95;&#95;</SUP>while
also providing for any
number of individually discrete, overlappingly co-occurrent,
frequency differentiated info-
interexchangings<SUP>&#95;&#95;</SUP>ergo, to be always accommodative of
any number of co-occurrent,
individual-pattern-integrity evolutionary scenarios.

 Thus the eternally regenerative Universe, embracing
the minimum complex
of intercomplementary transformations necessary to effect
total regeneration, becomes
comprehensively accommodated by the only generalizably
definable Scenario Universe as
the condition of the <I>vector equilibrium,</I> an everywhere-everywhen
condition at which
nature refuses to pause, but through which most economically
accommodating field of
operational reference she pulsates her complex myriads
of overlapping, concurrent, local
intertransformings and aberrative structurings. I then
invented the symbol

 Thereafter I set about sorting out the relative numbers

polyhedral-event "somethings"<SUP>&#95;&#95;</SUP>all
of which are always concentrically congruent and each
and all of which are to be

within the pre-time-size, pre-

 This book <I>Synergetics</I> (volumes 1 and 2) embraces the
record of the lifetime
search, research, sorting-outs, and structural-intertransforming
experiments based upon
the foregoing eight considerations, all of which I had
adopted by 1927. This 1927
inventory has been progressively amplified by subsequent
experience-induced
considerations.
