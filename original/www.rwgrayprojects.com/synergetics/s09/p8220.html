 <B>Starting With Parts:</B> The Nonradial Line: Since humanity
started with
parallel lines, planes, and cubes, it also adopted the
edge line of the square and cube as the
prime unit of mensuration. This inaugurated geomathematical
exploration and analysis
with a part of the whole, in contradistinction to synergetics'
inauguration of exploration
and analysis with total Universe, within which it discovers
whole conceptual systems,
within which it identifies subentities always dealing
with experimentally discovered and
experimentally verifiable information. Though life started
with whole Universe, humans
happened to pick one part<SUP>&#95;&#95;</SUP>the line, which was so short
a section of Earth arc (and the
Earth's diameter so relatively great) that they assumed
the Earth-scratched-surface line to
be straight. The particular line of geometrical reference
humans picked happened <I>not</I> to be
the line of most economical interattractive integrity.
It was neither the radial line of
radiation nor the radial line of gravity of spherical
Earth. From this nonradial line of
nature's event field, humans developed their formulas
for calculating areas and volumes of
the circle and the sphere only in relation to the cube-edge
lines, developing empirically the
"transcendentally irrational," ergo incommensurable,
number pi (<IMG SRC="../figs/pi.gif">), 3.14159 . . . ad
infinitum, which provided practically tolerable approximations
of the dimensions of circles
and spheres.

 Synergetics has discovered that the vectorially most
economical control line
of nature is in the diagonal of the cube's face and
not in its edge; that this diagonal
connects two spheres of the isotropic-vector-matrix
field; and that those spherical centers
are congruent with the two only-diagonally-interconnected
corners of the cube.
Recognizing that those cube-diagonal-connected spheres
are members of the closest
packed, allspace-coordinating, unit radius spheres field,
whose radii = 1 (unity), we <I>see</I>
that the isotropic-vector-matrix's field-occurring-cube's
diagonal edge has the value. of 2,
being the line interconnecting the centers of the <I>two</I>
spheres, with each half of the line
being the radius of one sphere, and each of the whole
radii perpendicular to the same
points of intersphere tangency.

 <B>Diagonal of Cube as Control Length:</B> We have learned
elsewhere that the
sum of the second powers of the two edges of a right
triangle equals the second power of
the right triangle's hypotenuse; and since the hypotenuse
of the two similar equiedged
right triangles formed on the square face of the cube
by the sphere-center-connecting
diagonal has a value of two, its second power is four;
therefore, half of that four is the
<I>second power</I> of <I>each</I> of the equi-edges of the right
triangle of the cube's diagonaled face:
half of four is two.

 The square root of 2 = 1.414214, ergo, the length
of each of the cube's
edges is 1.414214. The sqrt(2)happens to be one of those extraordinary
relationships of
Universe discovered by mathematics. The relationship
is: the number one is to the second
root of two as the second root of two is to two: 1:sqrt(2)
= sqrt(2):2, which, solved, reads
out as 1 : 1.414214 = 1.414214 : 2.

 The cube formed by a uniform width, breadth, and height
of sqrt(2) is sqrt(2<SUP>3</SUP>),
which = 2.828428. Therefore, the cube occurring in nature

 This is exploratorily noteworthy because this cube,
when calculated in terms
of man's conventional mensuration techniques, would
have had a volume of one, being the
first cube to appear in the omni-geometry-coordinate
isotropic vector matrix; its edge
length would have been identified as the prime dimensional
input with an obvious length
value of <I>one</I><SUP>&#95;&#95;</SUP>ergo, its volume would
be one: 1 &#215; 1 &#215;
1 = 1. Conventionally calculated,
this cube with a volume of one, and an edge length of
one, would have had a face diagonal
length of sqrt(2), which equals 1.414214. Obviously, the use
of the diagonal of the cube's
face as the control length results in a much higher
volume than when conventionally
evaluated.

 As we learn elsewhere (Secs.

 and
 <A HREF="p87400.html#990.00">990</A>), the
tetrahedron is not only
the basic structural system of Universe, ergo, of synergetic
geometry, but it is also <I>the</I>
quantum of nuclear physics and is, ipso facto, exclusively
identifiable as the unit of
volume; ergo, tetrahedron volume equals one. We also
learned in the sections referred to
above that the volume of the octahedron is exactly <I>four</I>
when the volume of the
tetrahedron of the unit-vector edges of the isotropic-vector-matrix
edge is <I>one,</I> and that
four Eighth-Octahedra are asymmetrical tetrahedra with
an equiangular triangular base,
three apex angles of 90 degrees, and six lower-comer
angles of 45 degrees each; each of
the 1/8th octahedron's asymmetric tetrahedra has a volumetric
value of one-half unity (the
regular tetrahedron). When four of the Eighth-Octahedrons
are equiangle-face added to
the equiangled, equiedged faces of the tetrahedra, they
produce the minimum cube, which,
having the tetrahedron at its heart with a volume of
one, has in addition four one-half unity
volumed Eighth-Octahedra, which add two volumetric units
on its corners. Therefore, 2 +
1 = 3 = the volume of the cube. The cube is volume three
where the tetrahedron's volume
is one, and the octahedron's volume is four, <I>and the
cube's diagonally structured faces
have a diagonal length of one basic system vector of
the isotropic vector matrix.</I> (See

 All but the icosahedron and its "wife," the pentagonal
dodecahedron, prove
to be volumetrically rational. However, as the tables
show, the icosahedron and the
vector-edged cube are combiningly rational and together
have the rational value of three
to the third power, i.e., 27. We speak of the pentagonal
dodecahedron as the
icosahedron's wife because it simply outlines the surface-area
domains of the 12 vertexes
of the icosahedron by joining together the centers of
area of the icosahedron's 20 faces.
When the pentagonal dodecahedron is vectorially constructed
with flexible tendon joints
connecting its 30 edge struts, it collapses, for, having
no triangles, it has no structural
integrity. This is the same behavior as that of a cube
constructed in the same flexible-
tendon-vertex manner. Neither the cube nor the pentagonal
dodecahedron is scientifically
classifiable as a structure or as a structural system
(see Sec.

interlinkage, uniformly moduled
coordinatability. Nor has it any initial, ergo inherent,

 In the synergetics' four-, five-, and six-dimensionally
coordinate system's
operational field the linear increment modulatability
and modelability is the isotropic
vector matrix's vector, with which the edges of the
co-occurring tetrahedra and octahedra
are omnicongruent; while only the face diagonals<SUP>&#95;&#95;</SUP>and
not the edges<SUP>&#95;&#95;</SUP>of the inherently
co-occurring cubes are congruent with the matrix vectors.
Synergetics' exploratory
coordination inherently commences integrally, i.e.,
with whole-systems consideration.
Consider the one-dimensional linear values derived from
the initially stated whole system,
six-dimensional, omnirational unity; any linear value
therefrom derived can be holistically
attuned by unlimited frequency and one-to-one, coordinated,
wavelength modulatability.
To convert the XYZ system's cubical values to the synergetics'
values, the mathematical
constants are linearly derived from the mathematical
ratios existing between the
tetrahedron's edges and the cube's corner-to-opposite-corner
distance relationships; while
the planar area relationships are derived from the mathematical
ratios existing between
cubical-edged square areas and cubical-face-diagonaled-edged
triangular areas; and the
volumetric value mathematical relationships are derived
from ratios existing between (a)
the cube-edge-referenced third power of the-often odd-fractioned-edge
measurements
(metric or inches) of cubically shaped volumes and (b)
the cube-face-diagonal-vector-
referenced third power of exclusively whole number vector,
frequency modulated,
tetrahedrally shaped volumes. (See Sec.

 The mathematical constants for conversion of the linear,

 We can assume that when the sphere radius is 1 (the
same as the nuclear
vector equilibrium) the Basic Disequilibrium 120 LCD
tetrahedral components of mild off-
sizing are also truly of the same volumetric quanta
value as the A and B Quanta Modules;
they would be shortened in overall greatest length while

 Because of the fundamental 120-module identity of
the nuclear sphere of
radius 1 (F = 0), we may now identify the spherical
icosahedron of radius 1 as <I>five;</I> or as
40 when frequency is 2F<SUP>2</SUP>. Since 40 is <I>also</I> the volume
of the F<SUP>2</SUP> vector-equilibrium-
vertexes-congruent sphere, the unaberrated vector equilibrium
F<SUP>2</SUP> = 20 (i.e., 8 &#215; 2 1/2
nuclear-sphere's inscribed vector equilibrium). We may
thus assume that the spherical
icosahedron also subsides by loss of half its volume
to a size at which its volume is also
20, as has been manifested by its prime number <I>five,</I>
indistinguishable from the vector
equilibrium in all of its topological hierarchies characteristics.

 Neither the planar-faceted exterior edges of the icosahedron
nor its radius
remain the same as that of the vector equilibrium, which,
in transforming from the vector
equilibrium conformation to the icosahedral state<SUP>&#95;&#95;</SUP>as
witnessed in the jitterbugging (see
Sec.
 <A HREF="../s04/p6500.html#465.00">465</A>)
<SUP>&#95;&#95;</SUP>did so by transforming its outer edge lengths
as well as its radius. This
phenomenon could be analagous the disappearance of the
nuclear sphere, which is
apparently permitted by the export of its volume equally
to the 12 surrounding spheres
whose increased diameters would occasion the increased
sizing of the icosahedron to
maintain the volume 20-ness of the vector equilibrium.
This supports the working
assumption that the 120 LCD asymmetric tetrahedral volumes
are quantitatively equal to
the A or B Quanta Modules, being only a mild variation
of shape. This effect is confirmed
by the discovery that 15 of the 120 LCD Spherical Triangles
equally and interiorly
subdivide each of the eight spherical octahedron's triangular
surfaces, which spherical
octahedron is described by the three-great-circle set
of the 25 great circles of the spherical
vector equilibrium.

 The significance of this unified field as defining

maximum limits of the inherent nuclear domain limits
is demonstrated by the nucleus-
concentric, symmetrical, geometrical hierarchy wherein
the rhombic dodecahedron
represents the <I>smallest,</I> omnisymmetrical, selfpacking,
allspace-filling, six-tetra-volume,
uniquely exclusive, cosmic domain of each and every
closest-packed, unit-radius sphere.
Any of the closest-packed, unit-radius spheres, when
surrounded in closest packing by 12
other such spheres, becomes the nuclear sphere, to become
uniquely embraced by four
successive layers of surrounding, closest-packed, unit-radius
spheres<SUP>&#95;&#95;</SUP>each of which four
layers is uniquely related to that nucleus<SUP>&#95;&#95;</SUP>with each
additional layer beyond four
becoming duplicatingly repetitive of the pattern of
unique surroundment of the originally
unique, first four, concentric-layered, nuclear set.
It is impressive that the unique nuclear
domain of the rhombic dodecahedron with a volume of
six contains within itself and in
nuclear concentric array:

 The one-quantum "leap" is also manifest when one vector
edge of the
volume 4 octahedron is rotated 90 degrees by disconnecting
two of its ends and
reconnecting them with the next set of vertexes occurring
at 90 degrees from the
previously interconnected-with vertexes, transforming
the same unit-length, 12-vector
structuring from the octahedron to the first three-triple-bonded-together
(face-to-face)
tetrahedra of the tetrahelix of the DNA-RNA formulation.
One 90-degree vector
reorientation in the complex alters the volume from
exactly 4 to exactly 3. This
relationship of one quantum disappearance coincident
to the transformation of the nuclear
symmetrical octahedron into the asymmetrical initiation
of the DNA-RNA helix is a
reminder of the disappearing-quanta behavior of the
always integrally end-cohered
jitterbugging transformational stages from the 20 tetrahedral
volumes of the vector
equilibrium to the octahedron's 4 and thence to the
tetrahedron's 1 volume. All of these
stages are rationally concentric in our unified operational
field of 12-around-one closest-
packed spheres that is only conceptual as equilibrious.
We note also that per each sphere
space between closest-packed spheres is a volume of
exactly one tetrahedron: 6 - 5 = 1.
