 The synergetics coordinate system-in contradistinction
to the XYZ
coordinate system-is linearly referenced to the unit-vector-length
edges of the regular
tetrahedron, each of whose six unit vector edges occur
in the isotropic vector matrix as
the diagonals of the cube's six faces. We also recall
that the eight corners of the cube are
defined and structured omnitriangularly by the symmetrically
interarrayed and concentric
pairs of positive and negative tetrahedra (Figs.

 Since the cube-face diagonal is the edge of the six-vector-edged,
four-
planes-of-symmetry tetrahedron, and since synergetics
finds the unit-vector-edged
tetrahedron to be the simplest structural system in
Universe, the tetrahedron's vector edge
logically becomes the most economically primitive simplex
module of relative length in
synergetics' coordinate system of exploratory reference.
Thus the tetrahedron's unit
vector edge of unity 2 is manifest as nature's coordinate
primitive-length module for
assessing:

as well as for assessing that vector's

<BR>
These areas and volumes become the logical unit of areal
and volumetric reference in
accounting the relative geometrical area and volume
values of the entire hierarchy of
primitive, concentrically congruent, symmetrical polyhedra
as these naturally occur around
any vertex of the isotropic vector matrix, and that
matrix's experimentally demonstrable,
maximum-limit set of seven axes of polyhedral symmetries,
which seven symmetries (Sec.

case formulations of all great-

Macmillan in 1961 and published

comprehensive coordinate system of
nature, which my 60-year exploration discovered. In
1944 I published a paper disclosing
this rational system. At that time I was counseled by
some of my scientist friends, who
were aware that I was continuing to make additional
refinements and discoveries, that
premature publication of a treatise of disclosure might
result in the omission of one or
more items of critical information which might be later
discovered and which might make
the difference between scientific acceptance or rejection
of the disclosures. Reminded by
those scientist-artist friends that we have only one
opportunity in a lifetime out of many
lifetimes to publish a prime-science-reorienting discovery,
I postponed publishing a
comprehensive treatise until in 1970, at the age of
75, I felt it could no longer be delayed.

 Because the XYZ-coordinate, three-dimensional system
values are arrived at
by successive multiplying of the dimensions, volume
in that system is an inherently three-
dimensional phenomenon. But in synergetics the primitive
values start holistically with
timeless-sizeless tetrahedral volume unity in respect
to which the cube's primitive value is
3, the octahedron's relative timeless-sizeless value
is 4, the rhombic triacontrahedron's is
5, and the rhombic dodecahedron's is 6. In synergetics,
when time-size special-case
realizations enter into the consideration, then the
(only-interrelated-to-one-another)
primitive volumes of the synergetic hierarchy are multiplied
by frequency of the edge
modulation to the third power. Since innate primitive
volume is a base-times-altitude
three-dimensional phenomenon, and since all the synergetics
hierarchy's time-size
realization volumes are inherently six-dimensional,
I was confronted with an exploratory
tactical quandary.

 The problem was to arrive at the numerical volume value
for the sphere in
the synergetics hierarchy, and the dilemma was whether
I should apply my synergetics'
volumetric constant to the first power or to the third
power of the XYZ-coordinate
system's volumetric values as arrived at by the conventional
XYZ-coordinate system's
method of calculating the volume of a sphere of radius
vector = 1. This operation is
recorded in Sec.
 <A HREF="p8220.html#982.55">982.55</A>
 of <I>Synergetics 1,</I> where I misconceptualized
the operation, and
(without reviewing how I had calculated the constant
for converting XYZ to synergetics)
redundantly took the number 1.192324, which I assumed
(again in mistaken carelessness)
to be the third-power value of the synergetics-conversion
constant, and I applied it to the
volumetric value of a sphere of unit vector diameter
as already arrived at by conventional
XYZ-referenced mathematics, the conventional XYZ-coordinate
volumetric value for the
volume of a sphere of radius 1 being 4.188, which multiplied
by 1.192324 gave the
product 4.99<SUP>&#95;&#95;</SUP>a value so close to 5 that I thought it
might possibly have been occasioned
by the unresolvability of tail-end trigonometric interpolations,
wherefore I tentatively
accepted 4.99 as probably being exactly 5, which, if
correct, was an excitingly significant
number as it would have neatly fitted the sphere into
the hierarchy of primitive polyhedra
(Sec.
 <A HREF="p8220.html#982.61">982.61</A>).
 My hindsight wisdom tells me that my
subconscious demon latched tightly
onto this 5 and fended off all subconsciously challenging
intuitions.

 In our always-experimental-evidenced science of geometry
we need only
show ratio of proportion of parts, for parts of primitive
polyhedra have no independent
existence. Ergo, no experimental proof is required for
(square) roots and (square) roots. Though those
numbers are irrational, their irrationality could not
frustrate the falling apart of the
polyhedral parts, because the parts are nonexistent
except as parts of wholes, and exact
proportionality is not required in the structuring.

 Whatever the workings of my subconscious may have been,
the facts remain
that I had erroneously concluded that the 5 was the
tetravolume of the sphere whose
diameter was our unit vector whose value was 2. In due
course I received a letter from a
mathematician, Ramsey Campbell, whose conventional calculations
seemed to show that I
was wrong. But I was not convinced that his conventional
results were not also erroneous,
inasmuch as they had been "cubically" arrived at rather
than tetrahedrally referenced.

 The cubically-arrived-at spherical volume (A) of a
sphere of diameter equal
to the unit edge of the XYZ coordinate system's cube
is 4.188. To convert that spherical
volume value (A) to that of sphere (B) whose diameter
is equal to the diagonal of the face
of the XYZ system's cube, we multiply the volume of
sphere (A) by the synergetics
hierarchy's volumetric constant, which is obtained by
taking synergetics' unit VE vector
linear constant 1.0198 and raising it to its third-power<SUP>&#95;&#95;</SUP>or
volumetric<SUP>&#95;&#95;</SUP>dimension, which
is 1.0198 &#215 1.0198 &#215; 1.0198, which equals 1.0606. Multiplying
the XYZ system's cube-
edge-diametered (A) sphere's volume of 4.1888 by the
synergetics' volumetric constant of
1.0606 gives us 4.4429, which is the sought-for volume
of the sphere (B). I thanked Mr.
Campbell and acknowledged my error.

 I then said to my mathematical associates, Robert Grip
and Chris Kitrick,
that there is no single item that more effectively advances
research than the unblocking of
our thought processes<SUP>&#95;&#95;</SUP>through experiential evidence<SUP>&#95;&#95;</SUP>of
a previously held erroneous
assumption. Wherefore my intuition told me that my error
may have been stubbornly clung
to because there might be something very important to
be discovered in this region of
investigation. There is possibly some enlightening significance
in the fact that I had
intuitively applied (and again forsaking the first correction,
had doubly reapplied) my
third-power synergetics' conversion factor to an already-three-dimensional
cubic-volume
quantation, which on the occasion of these retreatments
had erroneously seemed to me to
be as yet three powers short of the minimum primitive
realizable somethingness.

 Why did I think as I did? Why was I puzzled? I was
not confused about
arithmetical operations per se. We conventionally arrive
at the area of a square by
multiplying the square's edge length by itself, and
we arrive at the volume of a cube by
multiplying its edge length times itself twice<SUP>&#95;&#95;</SUP>that
is, we identify the square's area by the
second power of its edge length, and we identify a cube's
volume by the third power of its
edge length. All that seems simple and clear . . . until
we discover that the cube does not
exist and cannot exist until it has at least three other
observable attributes: weight,
duration, and temperature. Given the quantitative inputs
for those coordinate factors, the
cube as yet fails to "exist," because as calculated
it is now "solid," and physics has
discovered and proven that no such solid phenomenon
exists; wherefore the cubical
domain has to be substantively populated by atoms which
have a variety of interspacing
and interpositioning behavioral patterns.

 Also, in order to exist the cube must have both tension
and compression
forces so arranged and quantated as to produce a self-stabilizing,
independent behavior in
the presence of the cosmic complex of coexisting force
events. For it to exist there also
must be introduced coordinate factors that account for
the fact that this special case cube

which it is traveling around the

 As the Earth and the Sun whirl circumferentially in
company with the other
hundred billion stars of the galactic system, and as
all the while the galactic system keeps
company with all the now-known billion such galaxies
whose uniformly angled retreat
from one another at an astronomical speed altogether
constitutes what is called the
Expanding Universe . . . if we wrote out the formula
for integrating all those quantities
and for realistically diagramming its geometry and its
dimensions, we would have to admit
that the dimensions of the cube did not as yet produce
existence. There would as yet be

 Since our dimensional control is the prime vector,
and since a vector's
relative size represents mass times velocity, and since
mass has a priori both volume and
weight, it inherently introduces one more dimension
to velocity's a priori two-dimensional
product of time and distance. Ergo, vectors are in themselves
primitive, pre-time-size,
potentially energizable, three-dimensional phenomena.
Any special case time-size
phenomena must also be multiplied by frequency of subdivision
of the primitive system
taken volumetrically to the third power. We seem thus
to have arrived at nine
dimensions<SUP>&#95;&#95;</SUP>i.e., ninth powering<SUP>&#95;&#95;</SUP>and we have altogether

 This is how I came to adopt my ninth-power factor for
conversion from XYZ
coordination to synergetics coordination. Employing
the XYZ coordinated volume of
4.188790205, I multiplied it by the appropriate factor
(see table
 <A HREF="p86200.html#986.209">986.209</A>, where we find
that S<SUP>9</SUP> = 1.193242693), which produced the inherently
imperfect (only chord-describable
rather than arc-describable) sphere of 4.998243305.
This I knew was not a primitive three-
dimensional or six-dimensional <I>volume,</I> and I assumed
it to be the value of potential
energy embraceable by a sphere of vector radius = 1.
Ergo, both my conscious and

faultlessly, but I was confusing
the end product, identifying it as <I>volume</I> instead of
as potential <I>energy.</I>

 I was astonished by my error but deeply excited by
the prospect of reviewing
the exponentially powered values. Looking over the remaining
valid trail blazings, I
ruminated that the proximity to 5 that provoked the
4.998243305 figure might have other
significance<SUP>&#95;&#95;</SUP>for instance, as a real ninth-dimensional
phenomenon. There was some
question about that constant 1.193242693 being a sixth-dimension
figure: N<SUP>3</SUP> &#183; N<SUP>3</SUP> = N<SUP>6</SUP>,
which operation I had<SUP>&#95;&#95;</SUP>in my forgetfulness and carelessness<SUP>&#95;&#95;</SUP>inadvertently
performed.
Or the figure I had arrived at could be taken as nine-dimensional
if you assume primitive
demonstrability of minimum something always to have
a combined a priori volumetric-
and-energetic existence value, which is indeed what
synergetics vectorial structuring does

 Synergetics demonstrates that the hierarchy of vectorially
defined, primitive,
triangularly self-stabilized, structural-system polyhedra
is initially sixth-dimensional, being
both a vectorially six-way coordinate system (mass &#215;
velocity) as well as being
tetrahedrally<SUP>&#95;&#95;</SUP>ergo,
four-dimensionally-coordinate<SUP>4</SUP> <SUP>&#95;&#95;</SUP>ergo,
N<SUP>6</SUP> &middot; N<SUP>4</SUP> = N<SUP>10</SUP> somethings;
and that they grow expansively in time-size<SUP>&#95;&#95;</SUP>ergo, in
volume at the rate of F<SUP>3</SUP> <SUP>&#95;&#95;</SUP>ergo, in
time-size D<SUP>10</SUP> D<SUP>3</SUP> = D<SUP>13</SUP>,
a 13-dimensional special-case-somethingness
of reality.

(Footnote 4: It was a mathematical requirement of XYZ rectilinear coordination
that in order to demonstrate four-dimensionality, a fourth
perpendicular to a fourth planar facet of the symmetric system must be
found--which fourth symmetrical plane of the system is not
parallel to one of the already-established three planes
of symmetry of the system.  The tetrahedron, as synergetics' minimum
structural system, has four symmetrically interarrayed planes
of symmetry--ergo, has four unique perpendiculars--ergo, has
four dimensions.)

 We have learned in synergetics by physical experiment
that in agglomerating
unit-radius, closest-packed spheres around a nuclear
sphere of the same unit radius,
successively concentric symmetrical layers of the nuclear
surroundment occur in a pattern
in which the number of spheres in the outer shell is
always the second power of the
frequency of modular-system subdivision of the vector-defined
edges of the system, and
that when the primitive interhierarchy's relative volumetric
values are multiplied by
frequency to the third power<SUP>&#95;&#95;</SUP>and an additional factor
of six<SUP>&#95;&#95;</SUP>it always gives the
symmetrical system's total cumulative volume growth,
not only of all its progressively
concentric, closest-packed, unit-radius spheres' combined
shells, but also including the
volume of the unit-radius, closest-packed sphere shells'
<I>interstitial spaces,</I> as altogether
embraced by the exterior planes of the primitive polyhedra
of reference. (See Sec.

 Synergetics assumes an a priori to time-size, conceptually
primitive, relative
volumetric value of all the hierarchy of primitive polyhedra;
and it also assumes that when
we introduce frequency, we are also introducing <I>time</I>
and <I>size</I> (see Secs.
 <A HREF="../s07/p8100.html#782.50">782.50</A>
 and

 and we are therefore also introducing all
the degrees of freedom inherent in
time-size realizations of energetic-system behavior<SUP>&#95;&#95;</SUP>as
for instance the phenomenon of
inherent <I>system spinnability.</I>

 With the introduction of the phenomenon of system spinnability
around any
one or several or all of the hierarchy of concentric
symmetric systems' seven axes of
symmetry (Sec.
 <A HREF="../s10/p3363.html#1040.00">1040</A>
), we observe experientially that
such inherent system spinnability
produces a superficially spherical appearance, whose
time-size realizations might be
thought of as being only the dynamic development in
time-size aspects of the primitive
static polyhedral states. We recall the scientific nondemonstrability
of the Greek sphere as
defined by them (Secs.
 <A HREF="p7120.html#981.19">981.19</A>
 and
 <A HREF="../s10/p2000.html#1022.11">1022.11</A>). We also
recall having discovered that the
higher the frequency of the unit-radius-vertexed, symmetrical
polyhedra of our primitive
cosmic hierarchy, the more spherical do such geodesic-structured
polyhedra appear
(compare Sec.
 <A HREF="p86060.html#986.064">986.064</A>). I realized that under these
recalled circumstances it could be
safely assumed that <I>a sphere does not exist in the primitive
hierarchy of pre-time-size
polyhedral conceptioning,</I> whose timeless-sizeless<SUP>&#95;&#95;</SUP>ergo,
eternal<SUP>&#95;&#95;</SUP>perfection alone
permitted consideration of the vector equilibrium's
isotropic vector matrix as the four-
dimensional frame of reference of any time-size intertransforming
aberrations of realizable
physical experience. Such perfection can be only eternal
and timeless.

 Timeless but conceptually primitive polyhedra of differently-lengthed-and-
radiused external vertexes can be dynamically spinnable
only in time, thereby to produce
circular profiles some of whose longer radii dominantly
describe the superficial, illusory
continuity whose spherical appearance seems to be radially
greater than half the length of
the prime vector. (See Fig.

 Thus the only-superficially-defined spherical appearance
is either the
consequence of the multiplicity of revolving vertexes
of the polyhedron occurring at a
distance outwardly of the unit vector radius of the
prime polyhedral hierarchy, or it could
be inherent in the centrifugal deformation of the polyhedral
structure. Wherefore I realized
that my having unwittingly and redundantly applied the
synergetics constant of the sixth
power<SUP>&#95;&#95;</SUP>rather than only of the third power<SUP>&#95;&#95;</SUP>and my having
applied that sixth-power
factor to the theretofore nonexistent static sphere
of the Greeks' energy-and-time deprived
three-dimensionality, was instinctively sound. Thus
the erroneous result I had obtained
must not discourage my intuitive urge to pursue the
question further. I had inadvertently
produced the slightly-greater-than-vector-radiused,
highfrequency "spheric" polyhedron.

 It seemed ever more evident that it could be that <I>there
is no true sphere in
Universe.</I> This seemed to be confirmed by the discovery
that the sum of the angles around

to be shunned because it is
meaningless and possibly disastrously misleading to

 The best physically demonstrable definition of the
"spheric" experience is: an
aggregate of energy events approximately equidistant,
multidirectionally outwardly from
approximately the same central event of an only approximately
simultaneous set of
external events-the more the quantity of external points
measuringly identified and the
more nearly simultaneous the radius-measuring events,
the more satisfactorily "spherical."
With each of all the outward unit-radius events most
economically and most fully
triangularly interchorded with their most immediate
neighbors<SUP>&#95;&#95;</SUP>chords being shorter than
their corresponding arcs<SUP>&#95;&#95;</SUP>we find that the "spheric"
experience inherently describes only
high-frequency, omnitriangularly faceted polyhedra.
By geometrical definition these are
geodesic structures whose volumes will always be something
less than a theoretically
perfect omni-arc-embraced sphere of the same radius
as an omni-chord-embraced
geodesic sphere's uniformly radiused outer vertexes.

 As is demonstrated in Sec.
 <A HREF="../s02/p2400.html#224.00">224</A>, the sum of the angles
around all the vertexes
of any system will always be 720 degrees less than the
number of vertexes multiplied by
360 degrees. By the mathematicians' definition a perfect
arc-embraced sphere would have
to have 360 degrees around every point on its surface,
for the mathematicians assume that
for an infinitesimal moment a sphere's surface is congruent
with the tangent plane.
Trigonometry errs in that it assumes 360 degrees around
every spherical surface point.

 For instance, we have learned through experimental
evidence, the cosmic
hierarchy of primitive polyhedra has a limit set of
seven axes of great-circle symmetries
and spinnabilities. They are the 3, 4, 6 (VE), 12, 10,
15, 6 (icosa) great-circle-spinnable
systems. (See Table
 <A HREF="p86200.html#986.304">986.304</A>
 and Sec.
 <A HREF="../s10/p3363.html#1040.00">1040</A>.) Within that
inherently limited hierarchy of
seven symmetries, the triacontahedron, with its 15 different
great circles' self-
hemispherings and 120 triangular interconfigurings,
produces the maximum-limit number
of identical polyhedral surface self-facetings of all
great-circle systems in Universe (Sec.
 <A HREF="../s04/p0000.html#400.00">400</A>).
