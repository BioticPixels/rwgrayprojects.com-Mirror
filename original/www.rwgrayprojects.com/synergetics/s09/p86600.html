of all humanity's being able to <I>see

has ever discovered regarding
Universe, plus much more than science has ever discovered.
With all this experienceability
of most advanced scientific discovery all humanity will
come to appreciate the otherwise

with which Universe (which is

 What we employ for such self-instruction at a human-sense-detectable
level
to appreciate the meager difference between the "T"
square's 0.9995 edge length and the
"E" square's 1.00000 (alpha) edge length is to perform the
physical task of producing two
squares, which the human eyes can see and fingers can
feel are of different sizes. Unaided
by a lens, only the most skilled human eyes can see
something that is one one-hundredth of
an inch (expressed as 0.01 inch). A carpenter works
at no finer than 1/32nd of an inch. To
make a difference of 0.0005 undeniably visible to any
average human we would have to
use the popularly adopted 1/16th of an inch, which is
that of the common school ruler.
This 1/16th of an inch is expressed decimally as 0.0625.
To make 0.005 of an inch visible
we multiply it by 100, which makes it 0.05. One hundred
inches is eight and a half
feet<SUP>&#95;&#95;</SUP>the average room-ceiling height. If we make two
squares with 100-inch edges (8 l/2
feet "square") out of wooden planks and timber, we cannot
hold their dimensions to such
a close tolerance of error because the humidity and
temperature variations will be greater
than 0.05 inch. Even if we make the 8 l/2-foot squares
of steel and aluminum plate, the
expansion and contraction under common weather temperature
changes will be greater
than 0.05 inch.

 Fiberglass-and-epoxy resin is the substance that has
the minimum presently
known temperature-and-humidity-caused expansion and
contraction rates of all practically
producible materials. Wherefore: two square plates two
inches thick with edge lengths of
8 l/2 feet could be machine-tool "dressed" and placed
vertically face to face in a
temperature-controlled slot with one of each of both
of their bottom innermost 90-degree
corners jammed tightly into a "machined" corner slot,
which would then make it possible
to "see" with human eyes the difference in square size

 But nature's energy-as-matter transformed into energy-as-radiation
are
operations conducted at a size scale far different from
our experientially imagined
experiments. Nature operates her matter-to-radiation
energy exchanging at the atomic
level. The nucleus of the atom is where energy-as-matter
is self-interferingly knotted
together in most primitive polyhedral-patterning event
systems. The atomic nucleus
diameter is 1/100,000 the diameter of its electron-orbited
domain<SUP>&#95;&#95;</SUP>which domain is
spoken of by scientists as "the atom." One atomic diameter
is called the angstrom and is
the prime measurement unit of the physicists<SUP>&#95;&#95;</SUP>macrophysicists
or microphysicists, astro or
nuclear, as they might well be designated.

 Referring to those two 8 l/2-foot (the size of Barnum's
circus human giant)
in height and 2-inches-thick square plates of machine-dressed
fiberglass-epoxy resin and
their minimum-human-sense-detectability difference of
dimension, we find that the
angstrom-atomic theater of energy-exchanging performance
is only 1/126,500,000,000 the
size of the minimum average human sense detectability.
This figure, put into human-
experience-sensing terms, is the distance that a photon
of light expanding radially at
186,000 miles per second will travel-reach between the
time humans are born and the time

 What is important for us to realize here is that synergetics
mathematics,
beginning with the most primitive hierarchy of min-max
geometrical relationships,
expresses relationships that exist independently of
time-size. So we humans can think
intimately about structural principles of any size.
These primitive structural principles
disclose inherent geometrical nuclei in respect to which
all of Universe's convergent-
divergent, gravitational and radiational, contracting
into matter and expanding into
electromagnetics, and vice versa, together with their
terminal angular and frequency
knotting and unknotting events comprehensively and comprehendingly
occur. And since
the sum-total of both macro- and micro-physical science
evidences 100-percent
conservation of the energy of eternally regenerative
Scenario Universe, each smallest
differential fraction is of infinite importance to the
integrity of Universe.

 And since Physical Universe demonstrates the principle
of least effort, i.e.,
maximum efficiency to be infallibly operative, Universe
does the most important tasks in
the most exquisite manner; ergo, it is in the most exquisitely
minute fractions that she
hides her most important secrets. For all the foregoing
synergetics' disclosure of a means
of comprehending and operating independently of size
provides human mind with not only
a cosmic advantage but with all the responsibility such
a cosmic decision to invest such an
advantage in us implies. With these thoughts we address
ourselves now to considering not
only the critical cosmic surface-volume relationships
but also their unique behavior
differentials.

 In experiential structural reality the so-called sphere
is always and only an
ultra-high-frequency geodesic polyhedron; ergo, it is
always chord-circumferenced and
chord-convergent-vertexed rather than arc-circumferenced
and arc-vertexed; ergo, it is
always and only quasispherical, which quasispherical
structural form is experimentally
demonstrable as enclosing the most volume with the least
surface of any and all
symmetrical, equiangular, structural systems. Because
of the foregoing we find it desirable
to rename the spheric experience, using from now on
the word <I>spheric</I> in lieu of the
nonexistent, experimentally nondemonstrable "sphere."

 As an asymmetrical or polarized structural system,
the hemispheric-ended
cylinder has the same surface-to-volume ratio as that
of a sphere with an identical
diameter<SUP>&#95;&#95;</SUP>the latter cylinders as well as their hemispherical
terminals consist structurally
only of high-frequency, triangularly chorded structures.
The spheric and the hemispheric-
terminalled cylinders alike contain the most volume

symmetrical polyhedra. At the other extreme of the surface-to-volume
ratio, the
equiangular tetrahedron encloses the least volume with
the most surface of any and all
omnisymmetrical structural systems. The more asymmetrical
the tetrahedron, the more
surface is required to envelop a given volume. It may
be assumed, therefore, that with a
given quantity of the same energy invested as molecularly
structured, system-containing
capability, it is less tensionally stressful to enclose
a regular equiangular tetrahedron than it
is to enclose any asymmetrical tetrahedron.

 In respect to total surface areas of asymmetrical tetrahedra
of unit (i.e.,
identical volume) enclosure, it is experimentally demonstrable
that the greater the
difference between the most acute angle and the most
obtuse of its 12 surface angles, the
greater the surface-to-volume ratio will be, and therefore
the greater the tensional
stressing of its outermost cohering components<SUP>&#95;&#95;</SUP>ergo,
the greater the challenge to the
containment of its structural-system integrity. (See
Sec.
 <A HREF="p2000.html#923.00">923</A>
 and Fig.
 <A HREF="p2000.html#923.10">923.10</A>.) According
to Newton's law the mass interattraction of two separate
bodies deteriorates exponentially
as the distance apart decreases arithmetically; ergo,
the relative interproximity of the
atoms within any molecule, and the relative interproximity
of the molecules as structurally
interarrayed within any and all volume-containment systems<SUP>&#95;&#95;</SUP>and
the resultant structural-
integrity coherences of those systems<SUP>&#95;&#95;</SUP>trend acceleratingly
toward their theoretical atom-
and-molecule-interattractive-proximity limits. These
chemical-structure-integrity limits are
visibly demonstrated to the human eyes by the bursting
of bubbles or of children's
overfilled balloons or of any other internally overpressured
fluid-pneumatic, molecular-
membraned containers when the membrane impinging and
ricocheting interkinetic
acceleration of an increasingly introduced population
of contained gas molecules separates
the molecules of the container membrane beyond their
critical-proximity limits. These
critical-atomic-and-molecular-proximity limits are mathematically
and gravitationally
similar to the proximity limits governing the velocity
and distance outward from planet
Earth's surface at which a rocket-launched vehicle can
maintain its orbit and not fall back
into the Earth.

 In connection with this same cheese tetrahedron recall
we remember (1) that
we could push in on the face A of the tetrahedron at
a given rate of radial contraction of
the system, while pulling out face B at a matching rate
of radial expansion of the system,
which "couple" of local alterations of the system left
the tetrahedron unaltered in shape or
size throughout the transformation (Sec.
 <A HREF="../s06/p2200.html#623.00">623</A>) and just
as it was both before and after the
"coupled" transformings took place, the only altered
consequence of which was that the
tetrahedron's center of volume had migrated; and we
remember (2) that we could also
push in on the same tetrahedron's face C and pull out
on face D at a coupled rate other
than the coupled rate of radial expansion and contraction
of the A-B face-coupling's
intercomplementary transformings; by all of which we
learn that the tetrahedron can

 It must be noted, however, that because of the generalized
nonsimultaneity
of cosmic events, there exists an inherent lag between
the pushing in of face A and the
pulling out of face B, which induces an inherent interim
wave-depression or a wave-
breaking pulsating of the coupling functionings of the

 Fifth, I recall as recounted in Sec.
 <A HREF="p5550.html#961.40">961.40</A>
 that the
more elongated the unit-
volume tetrahedron of only one-edge-length-constancy
(the sixth edge), the less becomes
the unit-volume tetrahedron's least-altitude aspect
as related to its other interdimensional
aspects, wherefore there is attained a condition wherein
the controlling sixth edge's
wavelength is greater than half the tetrahedron's least-altitude
aspect<SUP>&#95;&#95;</SUP>at which condition
the tetrahedron spontaneously turns itself inside-out,
ergo, turns itself out<SUP>&#95;&#95;</SUP>not out of
Universe, but out of tune-in-able range. Prior to this
spontaneous tuning-out range we
have a vast range of now-partially-tuned-in-and-now-tuned-out,
which altogether
propagates finitely packaged, tuned-in energy information
occurring in packages yet
recurring in constant, contained wavelength intervals
that introduce what has hitherto been
considered to be the paradoxical aspect of electromagnetic
phenomena, of which it has
been misassumed that as of any one moment we can consider
our electromagnetic
phenomena as being continuous-wave phenomena or as discontinuous-particle
phenomena<SUP>&#95;&#95;</SUP>both simultaneous. We thus learn that no such
paradox exists. (Compare

related to the
matter-to-radiation transitional events that occur as
we transit between the T and the E
Quanta Modules. First, we note that bubbles are spherics,
that bubble envelopes are liquid
membranes, and that liquids are bivalent. Bivalent tetrahedral
aggregates produce at
minimum the octet truss. (See Sec.
 <A HREF="p86770.html#986.835">986.835</A> et seq.)
The octet truss's double-bonded
vertexes also require two layers of closest-packed,
unit-radius spheres, whose two layers
of closest-packed spheres produce an octet truss whose
interior intermembranes are planar
while both the exterior and interior membranes are domical.

 Sufficient interior pressure will stretch out the bivalent

from the liquid into the gaseous

 We realize that these last four recalls clearly identify
the isotropic vector
matrix as being the operative geometrical field, not
only when atoms are closest packed
with one another but also when they are scattered entropically
into the cosmically greatest
time-size galaxies consisting of all the thus-far-discovered-to-exist

us that we are witnessing the isotropic vector matrix
and its local vector equilibria
demonstrating integrity of accommodation at the uttermost

generalizable within this local 20-billion-year-episode
