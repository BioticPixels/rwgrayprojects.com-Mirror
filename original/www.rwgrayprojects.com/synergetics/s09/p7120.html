 <B>Pulsation Between Icosahedron and Vector Equilibrium:</B>
There is
manifest in the icosahedral fiveness, in contradistinction
to the vector equilibrium's
sixness, the seemingly ever annihilatable and ever-re-creatable
integer, eternally
propagating the complex of unique frequencies of the
92 inherently regenerative chemical
elements as well as all the other unique resonances
and frequencies of the electromagnetic,
protoplasmic, pneumatic-hydraulic, and crystallographic
spectrums, whose omnidirectional
yes-no pulsativeness occasions the omniexperienceable,
exclusively wavilinear, optically or
instrumentally tunable, allness of time-accommodated
human experience.

 The volumes of all the symmetrical Platonic polyhedra,
except the
icosahedron and its pentagonal dodecahedron, are whole,
low-order-number multiples of
the "regular" Platonic tetrahedron, consisting itself
of 24 modules, making that
tetrahedron seemingly the "basic unit of measure" of
all polyhedra. The inability of that
"regular" tetrahedron to fill all cosmic space turns
our comprehensive, cosmic-coordinate-

 The initial-frequency vector equilibrium has alternatively
either a <I>radiant</I>
rhombic dodecahedron core or a <I>gravitational</I> rhombic
dodecahedron core, either of these
alternates being of identical overall size and shape.
Both consist of 144 modules. From the
480 modules of the vector equilibrium, we subtract the
144 modules of the rhombic
dodecahedron, which leaves 366 modules surrounding either
the <I>radiant</I> or <I>gravitational</I>
rhombic dodecahedron nuclear-sphere-enveloping core.
Each module = 1/144th of our
spherical domain. 336/144 = 2 1/3 ; and 480/144 = 3 1/3; therefore,
one nuclear-sphere
domain surrounded by the parts of exactly 2 1/3 additional
spherical-domain-producing
modules, distributed symmetrically around the nucleus
in exactly 12 groups of 28 modules
each. 2 1/3 spheres divided by 12 = 7/36ths of one spherical
domain. 2 = 7/3 = 84/36
spheres = 7/36ths of a nuclear sphere. We do not produce
any complete regular
polyhedron by adding 28 modules to each of the 12 rhombic
dodecahedron faces. While
28 modules, i.e., 7/36ths of one spherical domain, may
be added to each corner vertex of
the vector equilibrium, they do not produce any complete
regular polyhedron at <I>initial
frequency</I> where F = both + 1 and - 1. Each nucleated
vector equilibrium = 3 spheres
exactly, and not 13 whole spheres as do 12 closest packed
around one. They have the
centers of 12 fractional spheres (7/36 each) close packed
around one whole sphere.

One vector equilibrium = 3 1/3 spheres. Therefore, one vector
equilibrium plus one
octahedron = four spheres = one tetrahedron of four
closest-packed spheres. One Eighth-
Octahedron = 96/8 = 12 modules. If we add eight Eighth-Octahedra

 Self has no clue to what the overall size of the away-from-self
otherness may
be until the otherness is in tactile contact with integral
self, whereby component parts of
both self and otherness are contactingly compared, e.g.,
"palm-to-palm." Lacking such
tactile comparing, self has no clue to the distance
the other may be away from self. The
principle is manifest by the Moon, whose diameter is
approximately one-million times the
height of the average human. The Moon often appears
to humans as a disc no bigger than
their fingernails.

 Without direct contact knowledge, curiosity-provoked
assumptions
regarding the approximate distance T can be only schematically
guessed at relativistically
from a series of observationally measured angular relationship
changes in the appearance
of the observed otherness's features in respect to experienced
time-measured intervals of
evolutionary transformation stages of self; such as,
for instance, self-contained rhythmic
frequencies or self-conceptualizability of angular-integrity
relationships independent of
size. Relative macro-micro system differentialing of
direct-experience-stimulated cosmic
conceptuality initiates progressive self-informing effectiveness
relative to covarying values
integral to any and all self-evolutionarily developing
observational history.

 For instance, it is discoverable that with linear
size increase of the tetrahedral
structural systems (see Sec.
 <A HREF="../s06/p2200.html#623.10">623.10</A>), the tetrahedral
surface enclosure increases as the
second power of the linear growth rate, while the volumetric
content coincreases at a
third-power rate of the linear rate of size increase.
Ergo, with a given tensile strength of
cross section of material (itself consisting of nebular
aggregates of critically proximate,
mass-interattracted, behavioral-event integrities),
which material is completely invested in
the tetrahedral envelope stretched around four events,
with one of the events not being in
the plane of the other three. The envelope of a given
amount of material must be stretched
thinner and thinner as the tetrahedron's four vertexes
recede from one another linearly, the
rate of the skin material thinning being a second power
of the rate of linear retreat from
one another of the four vertexial events. All the while
the interior volume of the
tetrahedron is increasing at a third-power rate and
is being fed through one of its vertexes
with an aggregate of fluid matter whose atomic population
is also increasing at a third-
power volumetric rate in respect to the rate of linear
gain by symmetrical recession from
one another of the four vertexial points.

internal kinetics of atoms and
molecules in the combined fluid-gaseous aggregate of
organisms, we can intuit cogently
that naturally interrepellent action-reaction forces
are causing the interior gaseous
molecules to accelerate only outwardly from one another
because the closest-packed limits
will not accommodate inwardly, while expansion is ever
less opposed and approaches
entirely unlimited, entirely unpacked condition. Sensing
such relationships without
knowing the names of the principles involved, humans
can comprehend in principle that
being confined only by the ever-thinning films of matter
stretched about them on, for
instance, a tetrahedron's surface, the third-power rate
of increase of the bursting force of
the contained volume of gases against the second-power
growth rate of the ever more
thinly stretched film, in respect to the first-power
growth rate of the system, swiftly
approaches parting of the enclosing film without knowing
that the subvisible energy events
have receded beyond the critical proximity limits of
their mutual mass-interattractiveness
and its inter-fall-in-ness proclivities, instead of
which they interprecess to operate as
individually remote cosmic orbitings. All of these principles
are comprehensible in
effective degree by individuals informed only by repeated
self-observation of human
saliva's surface tension behaviors of their lung-expelled,
tongue-formed, mouth-blowable
air bubbles as they swiftly approach the critical proximity
surface-tension conditions and
burst.

 Such information explains to self that the critical
dimensional
interrelationships are to be expected regarding which
their own and others' experimental
measurements may lead them to comprehend in useful degree
the complex subvisible
organisms existing between the energy states of electromagnetics,
crystals, hydraulics,
pneumatics, and plasmics. Thus they might learn that
the smaller the system, the higher the
surface-tension effectiveness in respect to total volumetric-force
enclosure and interimpact
effects of locally separate system events; if so, they
will understand why a grasshopper can
spring outward against a system's gravity to distances
many times the greatest height of
the grasshopper standing on the system and do so without
damaging either its mechanical
or structural members; on the other hand, humans are
unable to jump or spring outwardly
from Earth's surface more than one module of their own
height, and if they were dropped
toward the system from many times that height, it would
result in the volumetric-content-
mass-concentration acceleration bursting their mass
intertensioning's critical limits.

 Once there has been contact of the observer with the
otherness, then the
approximate T distance estimation can be improved by
modular approximations, the
modules being predicated on heartbeat intervals, linear
pacings, or whatever. These do,
however, require time intervals. No otherness: No time:
No distance. The specific within-

 Going beyond the original formulation of the four-sphere-vertexed
minimum
structural system (Sec.
 <A HREF="../s04/p1000.html#411.00">411</A>), we observe that the addition
of a fifth spherical otherness to
the four-ball structural system's symmetry brings about
a polarized-system condition. The
fifth ball cannot repeat the total mutually intertouching
experienced by each of the first
four as they joined successively together. The fifth
sphere is an oddball, triangularly nested
diametrically opposite one of the other four and forming
the apex of a second structural-
system tetrahedron commonly based by the same three
equatorially triangulated spheres.
This brings about a condition of two polar-apex spheres
and an equatorial set of three.
Each of the three at the middle touches not only each
other but each of the two poles.
While each of the equatorial three touches four others
of the fivefold system, each of the
two polar spheres touches only three others. Due to
this inherent individual
differentiability, the fivefoldedness constitutes a
self-exciting, pulsation-propagating
system. (Compare the atomic time clock, which is just
such a fivefolded, atomic-
structured, mutually based tetrahedral configuration.)

with the fivefold system can the latter learn from the

 Then along comes a sixth ball, and once more momentum-produced
dynamic
symmetry rearranges all six with three uniradius spheres
in the northern hemisphere and
three in the southern hemisphere: i.e., they form the
octahedron, spinning on an axis
between the face centers of two of its eight triangular
faces, with the other six triangles
symmetrically arrayed around its equator. Dynamic symmetry
nests the next ball to arrive
at the axial and volumetric center occurring between
the north and south polar triangular
groups, making two tetrahedra joined together with their
respective apexes congruent in
the center ball and their respective triangular base
centers congruent with the north and
south poles. Now the mass-interattracted, dynamically
symmetried group of seven spheres
is centered by their common mid-tetra apex; since the
sevenness is greater than the
combined mass of the next six arriving spheres, the
latter are dynamically arranged around
the system equator and thus complete the vector equilibrium's

 What seemed to humans to constitute initiation and
evolution of dimensional
connection seemed to start with his scratching a line
on a plane of a flat Earth, in which
two sets of parallel lines crossed each other perpendicularly
to produce squares on the
seemingly flat Earth, from the corners of which, four
perpendiculars arose to intersect with
a plane parallel to the base plane on flat Earth occurring
at a perpendicular distance above
Earth equal to the perpendicular distance between the
original parallel lines intersecting to
form the base square. This defined the cube, which seemed
to satisfy humanity's common

breadth, and height. Not

 If we insist (as humans have) on initiating mensuration
of reality with a cube,
yet recognize that we are not living on an infinite
plane, and that reality requires
recognition of the a priori sphericity of our planet,
we must commence mensuration with
consideration of Earth as a spherical cube. We observe
that where three great-circle lines
come together at each of the eight corners of the spherical
cube, the angles so produced
are all 120 degrees<SUP>&#95;&#95;</SUP>and not 90 degrees. If we make concentric
squares within squares on
each of the six spherical-surface squares symmetrically
subdividing our planet, we find by
spherical trigonometry that the four comer angles of
each of the successively smaller
squares are progressively diminishing. When we finally
come to the little local square on
Earth within which you stand, we find the corner angles
reduced from 120 degrees almost
to 90 degrees, but never quite reaching true 90-degree
corners.

 Instead of initiating universal mensuration with assumedly
straight-lined,
square-based cubes firmly packed together on a world
plane, we should initiate with
operationally verified reality; for instance, the first
geometrical forms known to humans,
the hemispherical breasts of mother against which the
small human spheroidal observatory
is nestled. The synergetic initiation of mensuration
must start with a sphere directly
representing the inherent omnidirectionality of observed
experiences. Thus we also start
synergetically with wholes instead of parts. Remembering
that we have verified the Greek
definition of a sphere as experimentally invalidated,
we start with a spheric array of events.
And the "sphere" has definable insideness and seemingly
undefinable outsideness volume.
But going on operationally, we find that the sphere
becomes operationally omni-
intercontiguously embraced by other spheres of the same
diameter, and that ever more
sphere layers may symmetrically surround each layer
by everywhere closest packings of
spheres, which altogether always and only produces the
isotropic vector matrix. This
demonstrates not only the uniformly diametered domains
of closest-packed spheres, but
also that the domains' vertexially identified points
of the system are the centers of closest-
packed spheres, and that the universal symmetric domain
of each of the points and spheres
of all uniformly frequencied systems is always and only
the rhombic dodecahedron. (See

 The initial generated minimum cube is defined by four
1/8th spheres
occurring close-packingly and symmetrically only at
four of the cube's eight corners; these
four corners are congruent with the four corners of
the prime tetrahedron, which is also
the prime structural system of Universe.

 The cube does occur regularly in the isotropic vector
matrix, but none of the
cubes has more than four of their eight corners occurring
in the centers of spheres. The
other four comers always occur at the volumetric centers
of octahedra, while only the
octahedra's and tetrahedra's vertexes always occur at
the volumetric centers of spheres,
which centers are all congruent with all the vertexes
of the isotropic vector matrix. None
of the always co-occurring cube's edges is congruent
with the vectorial lines (edges) of
the isotropic vector matrix. Thus we witness that while
the cubes always and only co-
occur in the eternal cosmic vector field and are symmetrically
oriented within the field,
none of the cubes' edge lines is ever congruent or rationally
equatable with the most
economical energetic vector formulating, which is always
rational of low number or
simplicity as manifest in chemistry. Wherefore humanity's
adoption of the cube's edges as
its dimensional coordinate frame of scientific-event
reference gave it need to employ a
family of irrational constants with which to translate
its findings into its unrecognized
isotropic-vector-matrix relationships, where all nature's
events are most economically and
rationally intercoordinated with omni-sixty-degree,
one-, two-, three-, four-, and five-
dimensional omnirational frequency modulatability.
