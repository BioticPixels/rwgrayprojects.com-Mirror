# rwgrayprojects.com-Mirror

This repository is a mirror of rwgrayprojects.com, [the website of Robert W. Gray](http://www.rwgrayprojects.com/ "rwgrayprojects.com"), converted to markdown from HTML beginning with /rbfnotes/maps.

The conversion includes a few formatting tweaks and proof reading. Any additions or subtractionsfrom the text, other than spelling corrections, or images will be clearly marked and access to the originals will be linked. Additionally:

- Any text with in `[]` has been added by the mirrorer, and was not written by Robert W. Gray.  
- Notes by the mirrorer are presented as 'Mirrorer note:' in a block quote. These provide additional information, including external links.  
- The only layout that has been altered is the navigation, everything else will remain the same.
