# rwgrayprojects.com-Mirror

This repository is a mirror of rwgrayprojects.com, [the website of Robert W. Gray](http://www.rwgrayprojects.com/ "rwgrayprojects.com"). The website is old, but a lot of the content is useful it is worth maintaining.

There are two main sections to this repository, the `markdown` folder, and the `original` folder.  

## Markdown Folder

The `markdown` folder contains pages from the original website converted from HTML to markdown for improved layout, and with the addition of 'mirrorer notes', which provide comments and more information, starting with `markdown/rbfnotes/maps`. `markdown` is still meant to be a mirror where the original content is preserved any additions are clearly highlighted.  

The conversion includes a few formatting tweaks and proof reading. Any additions or subtractions from the text, other than spelling corrections, or images will be clearly marked, and access to the originals will be linked. Additionally:

- Any text with in `[]` has been added by the mirrorer, and was not written by Robert W. Gray.  
- Notes by the mirrorer are presented as 'Mirrorer note:' in a block quote.
- The only layout that has been altered is the navigation, everything else will remain the same.

## Original Folder
The `original` folder is a raw clone of the site generated by HTTrack Website Copier version 3.48-21 on 6 January 2016 19:04:40. There were some 404s (63 errors in total), so the copy isn't perfect, but it is as close as possible at the time it was downloaded. 99 links were scanned, and 8535 files were written (339MB overall (339264319 bytes)).
