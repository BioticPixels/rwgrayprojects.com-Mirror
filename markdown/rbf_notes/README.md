# Notes to R. Buckminster Fuller's Work

## Notes to R. Buckminster Fuller's Work

R. Buckminster Fuller once wrote "Don't try to make me consistent. I am learning all the time."Admittedly, I <I>am</I> trying to make Fuller consistent. I have been studying Fuller's work for several years and I am now in the process of making my notes available through these web pages. I hope that by working together we can go through  Fuller's work and pull together a consistent presentation of his ideas. Being a physics and mathematics oriented person, I have concentrated on Fuller's science and mathematics related work. Even if you're not science oriented I hope you'll find these pages interesting. 

### List of subjectsâ€¦
